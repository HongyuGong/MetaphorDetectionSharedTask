latest corporate unbundler reveals approach roland franklin who is leading a pound bid for drg talk to frank kane
by frank kane
it seems that roland franklin the latest unbundler to appear in the uk ha made a fatal error in the preparation of his bid for stationery and packaging group drg
he ha not properly investigated the target dining facility
the head of pembridge investment through which the bid is being mounted say rule number one in this business is the more luxurious the luncheon room at headquarters the more inefficient the business
if he had taken his own rule seriously he would have found out that drg ha a very modest canteen at it bristol head office
there are other thing he ha on his own admission not fully investigated like the value of the drg property or which part of the drg business he would keep after the break up
when the bid wa launched last week mr franklin faced some criticism from city commentator on both those count
he regard the charge a unfounded
on property he is blunt
i do not regard property profit a earnings
we have made a bid of nearly for a company with a book value of we acknowledged there is some extra worth there but i can not see the sort of value they are talking about in property
if they can prove it is there we might pay for it
on the other criticism he is equally dismissive
that point about the core business is very unfair he say
it is difficult to decide when you are an outsider what the business is like
we would eventually like to do it along with the management within the philosophy we will impose
the franklin philosophy wa learnt in the u leveraged buyout business at the side of sir james goldsmith
mr franklin went there at the end of the after the collapse of keyser ullman the merchant bank where he wa a director that wa rescued by the bank of england
he feel that keyser problem were hastened by an unwise acquisition
he went to the u because goldsmith decided that if you wanted to be a capitalist the uk and france were not the place to be
along with sir james he found the u much more attractive taking over and breaking up some fairly hefty u corporation
he reject charge that he wa partly responsible for the casino atmosphere that gripped u corporate life in the early
we stirred it up yes but we never lost any money for anybody and we never added to the unemployment figure
what he ha learned from goldsmith the only genius i have ever come across is that the holding company is not the most important unit of corporate organisation
the concept of the company doe not interest me it the business that are important
it doe not matter whether or not drg make sellotape or basildon bond it of no consequence to anybody if somebody else make them
and there is always the ultimate unbundler defence that he will make money for his backer
in a takeover campaign that ha already seen vitriolic language he responds to the charge that he is mounting the bid to enrich himself and his friend by saying nobody could take that a a criticism this is an investor group
it would be a criticism if i wa doing it to impoverish myself
letter policy and politics at the labour party conference
from mr david soskin
sir i wa interested by your juxtaposition of poll predicts majority for labour with tory hold on september the latter referring of course to the conservative victory in wandsworth the significance of which appears to have been almost totally ignored by the medium
elector are always prepared to criticise the government in answer to pollster question but when the same individual arrive at the polling booth they simply can not bring themselves to vote labour into power
letter policy and politics at the labour party conference
from m molly meacher
sir despite a significant gap in the labour party education and training proposal their objective to double the number of in education must be welcomed september
england rate stand at per cent according to the latest statistic available
this compare with per cent in the u per cent in sweden per cent in west germany and per cent in japan
to add the education and training statistic to those figure doe not improve our relative position
labour hope to transform the situation by increasing the number of to five for the brighter youngster and providing grant for training course two year in a further education college followed by two with an employer for the rest
these reform will only achieve their objective if accompanied by the implementation of the education act provision for compulsory or education or training up to the age of
this clause ha never yet been activated
the sharply reduced number of will inevitably lead employer to bid up the wage of that age group to entice young people away from education and into unskilled or job
employer must be required to release for education and training for at least two day per week
only then will two vitally important and complementary goal be achieved to improve britain general educational and vocational competence and hence our productive capacity and to reduce our gross educational inequality between the elite who receive a narrow education to a very high standard and the rest
letter policy and politics at the labour party conference
from mr john pertwee
sir labour doe not need a commitment to proportional representation in order to scoop most of the centre ground at the next general election
all it need is to promise a investigation such a a royal commission into the practicality of an alternative voting system surely justified by the intense public interest now abounding
such a promise would be the only hope of a breakthrough for the disenfranchised voter and would have them flocking to the poll for mr kinnock
his problem will be that mr thatcher might decide to do it first and then she will garner the vote
letter policy and politics at the labour party conference
from mr denis macshane
sir if labour is to suggest the setting up of a specialist labour court september then such a momentous change in the industrial relation system deserves more discussion and need to be taken out of the of labour party conference politics
for three reason such a move should be welcomed
first it would bring britain into line with the best european practice notably in germany where local regional and federal labour court handle problem in a fair dispassionate way based on law precedent and judicial expertise in the labour field
second it would ensure that worker enjoyed positive right under law and reduce the emphasis of union immunity
labour law will always reflect the balance of power in society and a fully fledged labour court system will not remove class and fundamental difference
but it should be possible to create and enforce enough common rule to prevent the absurd of industrial relation legislation we have seen since
third a labour division of the high court would contribute to the process of constitutional reform in britain which surely is to be a key political issue in the
the trade union question would cease to haunt the labour party and while that might upset some conservative it would be good for the country
letter independence of
from the rev nerissa jones
sir on saturday you published an advertisement for the extra page of news and feature that you the independent will carry from october
what do independent expert say about our extra page asks the advertisement
the supposedly jokey answer are illustrated by photograph of people sleeping outside covered by copy of the independent they look like some of the hundred of visitor who come to st botolph crypt centre for homeless people every day
given the already appalling and growing rate of homelessness and lack of hostel facility in london when more people than ever will not only have to endure the freezing night of the coming winter on the street but perhaps permanent homelessness it wa terrible to see the situation being exploited for a joke by your advertisement just the thing now the evening are drawing in
the added coverage is exactly what i wanted
how much independence do you suppose a person ha who exists on the giro of a week
letter ec immigration check on train
from the rev gilmore
sir the content of sarah helm article immigration check to be made on train september are extremely worrying
during the recent european community election the representative of ec government promoted the ideal of a europe by
now it would appear from this article that this ideal is shattered and a europe is on the card
one for those who travel by aircraft and one for those who travel by train between london and paris
the presence of immigration official and police on board train is comparable to the scene of america where migrant labourer were turned back at state boundary
what criterion would police and immigration official use in their search for potential terrorist on a train that they could not use at a static checkpoint or airport
do terrorist or illegal person travel exclusively by train
this is a clear example of the extension of the prevention of terrorism act where criterion for stopping questioning and searching are purely subjective to the official involved
will a person accent dress or skin colour indicate the potential terrorist or for that matter football hooligan or drug pusher
this is a recipe for fear and anxiety
it may mean the detention of innocent people and indeed their imprisonment
letter cardinal sin
from mr jimmy donoghue
sir the publisher of viz are nearer the truth than they realise with their soccer strip september
cardinal hume ha not only the cross of being a fervent newcastle united supporter to bear he is also known to irreverent member of mayfair jesuit farm street church by his initial george basil hume
latecomer who continue to hope
from anne applebaum in warsaw
dozen more east german refugee arrived outside the west german embassy yesterday seeking asylum and passage to the west including some who missed by only a few minute a train that took more than of their compatriot to west germany
many of the new arrival who waited in the street outside the embassy said they were convinced there would be another train for them
the one they missed pulled out from warsaw east station at yesterday carrying cheering east german bound for the rhine region of west germany
once upon a time another german government let lenin cross another germany in a sealed train on his way to russia
more than year later lenin heir are allowing refugee from their communist regime escape in the opposite direction in an east train travelling across east german territory
among those leaving wa cornelia a young east berliner destined she said for west berlin via a very circuitous route
i still do know if my family know where i am or if they will suffer from my decision
but i saw no other way out i did know if i would ever have a chance again
some of the refugee had been living in polish exile for a long a seven week while others arrived only a few hour before west german diplomat announced they could leave
only two failed to go a new mother and her child who wa born in a polish hospital four day ago
the east german government decision to let the refugee leave across their own country came a a surprise to many including some west german diplomat
some of the refugee originally refused to touch east german territory again but were reassured when two of the west german diplomat said they would accompany the train to ensure that the rule were followed
during the journey east german official will enter the train and collect all east german passport
west german will then issue new one
legally the refugee have been expelled from east germany meaning that under current rule they can not return
according to unofficial report the arrangement wa designed by the west german foreign minister han dietrich genscher the new polish foreign minister krzystof skubiszewski and the soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze who met recently at the united nation in new york
communist allow burial of montenegro last king
from marcus tanner in cetinje yugoslavia
the people of montenegro yesterday welcomed home the remains of nicholas i their first and last king after year exile in italy in belated fulfilment of his last will and testament
thousand of montenegrins many in national costume waited at the quayside in bar for the italian warship that would bring him home
then they formed a slow procession behind the coffin into the mountain to the old royal capital of cetinje for his reburial in the monastery there
what wa surely the last ever montenegrin royal event wa masterminded by the republic new communist leadership which ha abruptly stopped describing nicholas a a class enemy to ride the same wave of popular patriotism and royal fervour which swept serbia in the recent celebration of the anniversary of the battle of kosovo
the latest biography now call him an outstanding statesman warrior and man of letter
if i die abroad in exile let my body rest in a temporary grave until my mortal remains be transferred to our dear homeland said the montenegrin president branko kostic reading the royal will and testament to the crowd in cetinje square who carried flag and portrait of nicholas and his queen milena
today the people of montenegro fulfill the wish of their first and last king guided by innate love and respect for their history he went on
our tourist organisation are counting on big profit said srdan darmanovic a member of the montenegrin central committee
this will be good for the montenegrin economy too
montenegro young and leadership which came to power this year amid furious popular dissatisfaction with the old men in grey suit sponsored the gathering of nicholas surviving relative the first royal reunion organised by a communist government
a letter dropped through the post from the president of the socialist republic of montenegro inviting me to the funeral said john kennedy a conservative party member who life in barking and is a distant relative of nicholas
montenegro sudden rehabilitation of nicholas memory is a popular move
he liberated u from the turk and fought for our independence said a small boy who waited at the quayside amid a jostling crowd of former monarch visiting serbian bishop and television crew
marko radoman and a veteran of both balkan war wa given a place at the front a one of the few with personal memory of nicholas reign
for a man whom rebecca west a contemporary balkan observer called repulsive and treacherous for deserting his serbian king alexander in the first world war it is a view of history
nicholas wa known a the uncle of europe for his success in marrying his beautiful but penniless daughter into the grander royal house of russia serbia and italy
this furthered his ambition to rule a large south slav kingdom when the ottoman empire finally collapsed
one daughter a grand duchess of russia even gained a footnote in history by introducing an unknown monk rasputin to the russian tsarina alexandra
in his minute inaccessible capital which today ha only inhabitant nicholas erected a miniature european court and an exquisitely furnished victorian palace
he even persuaded european power to turn cottage into full embassy
it wa a fair achievement in a town which an earlier observer described a hovel
but nicholas grand design collapsed in when his serbian alexander deposed him and incorporated montenegro into yugoslavia
obituary virgil thomson
by peter dickinson
virgil thomson wa a composer and writer of originality courage and wit formed by a unique mixture of american and french influence
thomson wa born in kansa city in studied at harvard and then mostly lived in paris until
his missouri childhood gave him access to baptist hymn and church music but at harvard he wa introduced to the writing of gertrude stein and the music of erik satie
these influence laid the foundation for the blend of the naive and the sophisticated which is the hallmark of thomson maturity
like many young american composer he studied with nadia boulanger but after set out to achieve the discipline of spontaneity which he found in stein writing
when he collaborated directly with her in opera the result wa of historical significance
first came four saint in three act produced in and then the mother of u all which demonstrated a new kind of plotless opera only now reaching a wider currency through the stage work of philip glass
in four saint thomson informality wa given free reign since he first of all improvised the music at the piano then when it stuck wrote it down to a figured bass
he said i had wondered whether a piece so drenched in anglican chant running from gilbert and sullivan to morning prayer and back could rise and sail
but the resulting mixture of hymn folksy tune and recitative at time of intoxicating banality wa a sensation
the opera like gershwin porgy and be the following year used an cast and the staging and choreography gave it a british connection since it wa by frederick ashton
the mother of u all show more continuity but again much depends upon production in what is still a largely opera
in three year before aaron copland thomson started writing film score which were a model of unobtrusive clarity and pertinence combining american material to suit documentary such a the plow that broke the plain and the river with the musique approach of satie
his score for the film louisiana story wa awarded the pulitzer prize in
another response to a visual stimulus wa thomson series of musical portrait of people such a picasso and aaron copland
the first of these wa written in and they number about
just a thomson transferred stein literary abstraction to music so these portrait unusually employ the painter technique of drawing the sitter from life an ideal combination of thomson habit of immediate response with an actual subject
the result are terse and sharply etched like the best line drawing
thomson could control word with the same fastidiousness a note
he always felt that effective musical criticism began by being well written and he never lost his liveliness
one never quite knew what he wa going to say next
he started by writing occasional article but in he wrote the state of music a trenchant and provocative assessment of the machinery of the musical profession at the time
from to he wrote regularly for the new york herald tribune and four volume of his notice have appeared in book form
he wrote a fulsome autobiography characteristically entitled virgil thomson on virgil thomson and a personal survey american music since appeared in followed recently by a selected edition of his letter
a both composer and critic he touched both side of the coin a climate of receptivity is what the artist most desire
it is also a thing that even the most experienced reviewer can not always offer
thomson judgement about music were not always a accurate a his confident expression implied he invited discussion
above all he restored the focus of music criticism onto the music itself
he made no secret of his francophile enthusiasm in reaction to the earlier domination of american music by german and he wa one of the first writer to register the importance of jazz
he fearlessly attacked convention which caused problem when he pitched into established reputation
it ha become increasingly apparent that thomson belonged to the american experimental tradition
he anticipated some of the enthusiasm of john cage whom he first met in
a few year later thomson recognised cage a the most original composer in america if not the world and cage repaid the compliment by writing the work section of a monograph on thomson
but finally in spite of their common root in satie and stein thomson felt that cage aesthetic wa destructive
thomson song contain some of his finest work
there are stein setting such a portrait of fb but also cycle such a five song from william blake prayer and praise and a cantata based on poem by edward lear
thomson wa also prolific in instrumental music on both chamber and solo scale
for many year thomson lived in new york in his apartment at the chelsea hotel
from there like a buzzard in it eyrie he would make foray round the u and abroad in spite of his advanced age
he seemed a genial and indestructible landmark in the history of american music in spite of defective hearing which had bothered him since the late seventy
he had a photograph of himself on his postcard and he signed his letter following the original tailpiece everbest
thomson came from a generation of american composer which had to find it own way without benefit of university patronage
in that kind of free market he thrived and survived and so will the best of his work
obituary thomas keller
by hugh matheson
thomi keller is the outstanding figure in the history of international rowing
he wa president of fisa federation internationale de societes the world governing body for year and most of this body attitude and practice reflect the force of his strict but genial personality
most athlete first encountered him a a voice bellowing in fury at official who had broken rule or arrangement designed to make racing safer or more fair
he wa elected to succeed gaston mullegg a president of fisa when he wa and still competing in the swiss rowing team
he did not loosen his link with the athlete when projected upwards into the presidency
provided their behaviour wa sportsmanlike and safe oarsman found only encouragement and humour from a president who wa always among them
keller zurich upbringing made him into a skiier and sculler and he raced for the grasshopper club
he competed for the swiss and team at the student winter game and later concentrated on single scull
in he wa swiss scull champion and finished third in the european championship before moving to manila to work for his family private multinational company eduard keller ltd for four year
on his return keller wa swiss champion again in and wa bitterly disappointed when the swiss chose to boycott the olympics after the russian intervention in hungary
fisa wa then a relatively unimportant body which organised european and other championship and participated in the running of olympic regatta
a a rich forceful young man keller had been earmarked a a likely future president even before mullegg wa killed in an aircrash in
rowing wa transformed in the breadth and depth of participation over the year of his term
he sat on the appropriate board of the international olympic committee and wa president of the general assembly of international sport federation for year
these position were not held for his own status but to promote the cause of rowing where it needed clout
he successfully defended rowing a an olympic sport and in introduced woman event which have now expanded to six class
his personal preference for sculling over rowing assisted the introduction of quadruple scull to world championship and olympic competition
keller wa made a steward of henley royal regatta in a time when the proliferation of new course around the world which had emerged under his guidance seemed a threat to the regatta founded in
but it wa the spirit of henley with huge crowd enjoying amateur sport presented with administrative finesse which keller took a the yardstick for the international circuit
he loved the place and he returned every year to play an often small part a umpire of race between undistinguished club far below the olympic standard he wa obliged to administer
he said this summer that a he gradually wound down his involvement in sport henley would be the last thing he would give up
during his term a president of fisa he gradually reduced his role in eduard keller ltd and used the company office to provide a world headquarters for rowing
the sport is now obliged to find income from the more normal source of television and sponsorship to replace his largely unacknowledged private patronage
in spite of his gift to the sport keller wa anxious not to abuse his status a president and never went to a rowing event unless invited
because of this he had never seen the oxford and cambridge boat race until this year
he wa enthralled by the entire proceeding and remarked that only the english could make a contest between two crew which would not rank in the world top into a bigger spectacle than the olympic final
the final task he set himself for his presidency which wa due to end next year wa to weed out of the regatta calendar all the rowing course which could be made unfair by the wind
he had recently travelled from tasmania to norway in search of the perfect metre of flat water
it wa a blessing that in response to congratulation on the superb world championship regatta at bled in yugoslavia three week ago he wa able to reply yes and best of all the condition were fair throughout
the labour party conference cook appeal for labour to accept electoral reform
by colin hughes and colin brown
an impassioned appeal for labour to back electoral reform wa made by a leading shadow cabinet member yesterday after the national executive decided overwhelmingly to oppose a proportional representation motion
robin cook a member of the national executive and the health spokesman said that a labour government which sought to force it programme on an unwilling nation would be unsocialist
he told a labour committee rally that it wa not enough for labour to win the next election
it would also be necessary to smash the decrepit effete constitution that allows a minority to capture power and then use it ruthlessly in the interest of the privileged few
mr cook argued that year of thatcherism had been forced on most people who had never voted conservative and that many of those who opposed pr in the labour party wanted to use the same undemocratic power to ram socialism down the throat of a majority who did vote for it
advocate of the system argued that it wa the only way of delivering strong government mr cook said
but after year of tory rule he had had enough of that approach to politics
labour would be acquiescing in a democratic outrage if it continued arguing that because the conservative had got away with being undemocratic for so long it wa now labour turn
mr cook also countered the argument that pr would build in a pull towards the centre ground preventing labour from implementing a radical programme
it seemed strange to make that argument mr cook said when it wa clear the whole policy review process wa designed to placate the centre ground
i can not honestly see that a system which would require u to compromise the morning after the election is really so morally inferior to a system which ha already obliged u to compromise our policy two year before polling day
his speech however came aftera vote in the national executive to oppose a proportional representation motion which will be debated on thursday
the four were mr cook ken livingstone john evans and clare short
mr livingstone said he wa against pact but year of thatcherism had demonstrated the danger of giving power to elite
however neil kinnock the labour leader and roy hattersley his deputy both opposed the motion
mr hattersley said giving disproportionate power to small minority centre party would not improve democracy
mr kinnock said it wa wrong to propose a fundamental change in the voting system for a tactical vote to get rid of the thatcher government
the only way to remove the government wa for labour to win the next general election
mr kinnock intends to reinforce his conviction that labour is in a position to win in his keynote speech tomorrow
party organiser want the conference to show that the party is united a never before leaving mr kinnock free for the first time to sell the policy package to voter without worrying about split
there is expected to be a close vote on defence but mr kinnock is confident the new policy will be affirmed today
the executive is recommending rejection of a motion calling for unilateral disarmament
it is also urging the conference to oppose a motion supported by the national union of mineworker to commit a labour government to abolishing all nuclear power within year
there could also be controversy over the executive rejection of demand for the age of consent for homosexual to be reduced to year
pub rock rock n roller jim white selects the best of the london pub venue and gig in the week ahead
by jim white
general tip a general rule for pub rock patron is that the quality of music will be in inverse proportion to the quality of the beer except at finsbury park sir george robey where an excellent music policy come complete with a decent pint of guinness
another rule of thumb is that if the act is obliged to rest their microphone stand and amplifier on beer crate instead of the stage it will be a good evening
there are two type of pub rock occasion those like the one described above where the band is likely to suffer from agrophobia and those where the pub is so crowded death through asphixiation seems to be the only way to get out

ripping yarn and moral minefield allan and janet talk ahlberg talk to celia dodd about their bestseller for child
by celia dodd
these day no one question the importance of good book for the
but book that appeal to adult too are just a important we are after all the one who have to do the reading
there are few thing worse than being bludgeoned into reading a book you hate
should be one of the great joy of parenthood a real meeting of adult and child mind
with the ahlbergs book it very often is
the partnership behind such classic a the jolly postman burglar bill and the baby catalogue win child over with ripping yarn and a wicked sense of humour
they win their parent over with a vision of the world which is decidedly reassuring
their book are usually set nostalgically in the past the thirty and forty are favourite period and often feature the perennial character of fairy tale and nursery rhyme
yet they are saved from sentimentality by the wry humour of both text and picture
the ahlbergs have been accused of not facing up to the harsh reality of life of being too cosy and sweet but their latest picture book bye bye baby published today break the mould
in it a small child roams the street talking to stranger until he finally go off with a woman who ha been wandering about pushing an empty pram
curious subject matter for a child picture book you might think and hardly guaranteed to win the approval of the child book world
but the ahlbergs have no time for literal interpretation of their work
how they argue would alice or the wind in the willow stand up against such scrutiny
the way to look at bye bye baby they insist is a a light surreal comedy
certainly if you bring a literal interpretation to the story it a minefield allan ahlberg say
bye bye baby get away with it particular minefield thanks to the sleight of illustrator janet ahlberg hand
the visual inspiration for the book wa the famous advert for shoe showing a small boy and girl walking off down a avenue an innocent image if ever there wa one
the ahlberg version feature a solitary figure
the advert gave the story it vaguely thirty setting
the success of the ahlbergs working relationship must have a lot to do with their long and happy marriage
in spite of apparently incompatible personality she is small and shy he is large and doe most of the talking they have an empathy which is essential to the way they work a persistent mutual pestering
the strength of the partnership is highlighted for allan who also work with a number of other artist
the nature of janet part in the process combined with a bad back which prevents her spending more than a couple of hour at the drawing board every day mean she can not keep up with her husband prolific output
with other illustrator i work at a distance we visit and phone but there is a point at which i ca pester them any more allan say
they see themselves not a author and illustrator with separate role but a a partnership of contributing equally to the process
allan ahlberg say in the past a lot of child book seemed to be the work of talented illustrator whose picture looked brilliant framed in a gallery but when you tried to read the book there wa nothing there because the word started a a to hang picture on
given the importance they place on the interrelationship of word and picture the couple working life are surprisingly separate
they claim to see each other le than couple who go out to work meeting for the occasional cup of coffee in the kitchen
their daughter jessica who is likely to be seen with her head buried in the beano or a roald dahl novel ha provided the inspiration for many of her parent book
a a baby she wa fascinated by the mothercare catalogue and so the baby catalogue which document the paraphernalia of the infant small world in minute detail wa born
allan experience a a primary school teacher is another rich source of idea
the couple still maintain close link with local school where they spend hour researching sketching and absorbing joke
after year of teaching allan had had enough
i ran out of steam
it a killing job
little kid eat you alive they want so much physically and emotionally
every year he would have half a dozen and in his class who could barely read
he treated reading a a team effort getting them to read the daily mirror rather than the dull babyish book on offer
these day he writes the book intended to help child learn to read
a lot of book used in school are technically readable but rather drab story
there no reason why they should be funny or gripping even if they do use many word
writing book for child is becoming increasingly complex a the arbiter of the modern child more librarian teacher and publisher lay down ever more stringent criterion
the problem with child book increasingly is that there are army of people who are properly concerned with for example the way girl were always discriminated against in the past say allan
that is bad and must be thought about
but people seem to think that story are written to a prescription that you sit down and say you do want it to be sexist you do want it to be racist
in reality you just invent a tale a if you were sitting round a fire in a cave
in fact and seem to come naturally to the ahlbergs
their book are full of female breadwinner and new men changing nappy and comforting bawling baby in the small hour
although they are a principled pair they once turned down the smarties award on moral ground the ahlbergs reject the notion of child author a moralist
i would say just sit down and tell a good story and to hell with the morality allan ahlberg declares
with that characteristically strong statement he put his finger on the secret of the ahlbergs phenomenal success with adult and child alike
the revolution the countryside need christian wolmar say britain is lagging behind in setting up telecottages
by christian wolmar
the information technology revolution ha left large swath of rural britain untouched
the only computer in many village are those owned by the teenage boy of the affluent to play their game
ashley dobbs an engaging young entrepreneur is setting out to change that by creating a nationwide network of telecottages
this clever name with it neat evocation of new and old describes a concept which wa developed in sweden and is spreading to rural area across the world
in mr dobbs word a telecottage is a room in a village filled with computer communication that can be used by local people to learn and work
the equipment consists of perhaps four word processor a modem a laser printer able to produce output a fax and a photocopier
software programme for publishing word processing accounting and business planning are also essential
mr dobbs who is chairman of telecottages uk warns possible user not to get bogged down with the technology the equipment is a tool to overcome what need to be done
people must think that because there a computer they got to think of a use for it
he reckons there are no shortage of possible us farmer can use it to do their account woman with responsibility can work in their own time on the word processor publicity material for local craftsman can be produced and so on
this may sound utopian but it ha been borne out by the experience of existing telecottages
so far about have been established mainly in scandinavia but also in japan and several third world country
a the network expands so do the us
the first wa opened in the village of vemdalen in the remote forest of sweden in september
the impact according to henning albrechsten president of telecottages international who ha been involved in their development since the outset wa immediate
by holding open meeting for child and having the telecottage above the local store people of all walk of life came in entrepreneur and their spouse shop assistant craftspeople and child
now per cent of the village regularly us telecottage and at least per cent ha taken course there
britain is lagging behind
no telecottages have been established but there are several initiative in the offing
the most advanced is a plan for five in the north of scotland which will be funded by the highland and island development board and british telecom
colin pavey of british telecom hope that they will be running by the end of the year
two would be and three would be and located in school
we are most interested in the idea of networking sharing skill such a translation and using them for distance learning
telephone cable in the region are being upgraded to ensure they are capable of handling fax
mr dobbs more unlikely ally are the woman institute
most of the worker in telecottages and many of the user are woman
he say in village there are many woman with skill who are using them because of problem
but they are interested in working
user of telecottages are given the key and people can use them at any time which mean that woman can come in during the evening early in the morning or whatever
he is working on a scheme with the national federation of wi to organise a competition to celebrate next year anniversary by offering telecottages a prize for it branch and he is hoping the wi will establish a pilot telecottage near it college in denman oxfordshire
while telecottages should become once established they do need initial subsidy
the cost of providing the equipment is in the order of and mr dobbs think space is not much of a problem there usually the village hall or an empty shop
henning albrechsten reckons that it take three year for a telecottage to be able to function without subsidy
in scandinavia with their mixed economy money is always available after a bit of persuasion from both local and central government
in britain the tight financial regime imposed on local council and the reluctance of central government to take on any new expenditure make it necessary to seek fund from the private sector
the only government support so far ha been a recommendation by the rural development commission part of the department of the environment to establish a pilot scheme
mr dobbs sigh this is a typically british bureaucratic response
it been proved elsewhere that they work
we do need pilot we need telecottages
a for the private sector while bt may be happy to provide pump priming for five telecottages in the north of scotland it is not about to bankroll a nationwide network
nor it seems is anyone else
there is more at stake here than just bringing box of sophisticated equipment to remote area
a mr dobbs who run a country house restoration business from his home in micheldever hampshire say village are good place to live and work
the village is a fantastic institution and they make people happier
but the village are dying becoming suburb or dormitory where few people work but many sleep
employment in agriculture still the main rural industry fell from over a million in the to under now
the aim of telecottages is to create flexible employment which will provide new job and make existing rural industry more competitive
the emphasis on high wage is important
village are expensive to live in and if they are to become vibrant community again local people must be able to earn enough to be able to continue living in them
there is a wider impact too
the abstract talk of commuting by rail or road being replaced by information technology find a concrete expression in the idea of telecottages
once people overcome their fear about computer and begin to use them in telecottages they acquire their own equipment
many may eventually be able to work from home rather than commute to an office
henning albrechsten say modern information technology ha given people in remote region the opportunity to overcome their worst handicap their distance from the centre of learning and development
he see them a not only strengthening small community but also a actually beginning to reverse the population flow from the countryside to the town
britain with it growing traffic problem seems an ideal place for the onset of this revolution
despite mr dobbs tireless effort this is another revolution which britain is likely to be viewing from the sideline
rugby union welsh horizon all turn black
by steve bale
each new indignity in the heap visited on welsh rugby seems worse than the last
the selector knew they were playing with fire when they decided to arrange a couple of club fixture and they have duly been consumed in a conflagration of their own making
the new zealander appropriately garbed in funereal black arrive next week to scatter the ash
on and off the field the national game of the land of song is in a discordant mess
losing wa one thing but to lose a spinelessly a the welsh xv did to bridgend on saturday wa to add insult to severely injured pride
in all honesty we should have won by at least point brian nicholas the bridgend coach said
a if and derisive chant of easy easy were not bad enough this humiliation wa against a side who have made a wretched start to the season a week earlier pontypool had given them a and were short of at least player
four of the absentee suffered the squirming discomfort of being among the welsh squad
it not that i do want to say anything but i just do know what to say john ryan the welsh coach sighed
his plan in ruin he is now reduced to hoping something will turn up before his player face the all black in five short week
at bridgend he looked in despair and he almost admitted a much i hope we can pull it together but sometimes i have my doubt
nicholas wa sympathetic he is only a good a the player we give him
but another selector confided the truth that wale should be giving club opposition a hammering and at building on their win over newbridge it looked a if they would
they had weathered bridgend early fury conceding a try before coming back with some confidence to score three of their own
but wale were having u on
from the comparative opulence of they then slipped into penury by conceding unanswered point
bridgend raised their game against wale now wale must do precisely the same against new zealand
no one who wa at the brewery field perhaps not even the selector would give twopence for their ability to do so
the back were mainly pedestrian but the fundamental problem lay elsewhere
apart from kevin moseley steady supply from the there wa nothing much to commend in a welsh forward effort which reverted to the very worst eighty stereotype of static cumbersome donkey only too willing to slow the game to walking pace
when the pressure come on player revert to bad habit ryan said
the all black would treat such an outmoded approach with the scorn it deserves although on the other hand they might have been impressed with bridgend contrasting mobility and aggression
the back row were swifter to the loose ball had a clearer idea of what to do with it when they got there and their impressive were given every opportunity which they eagerly took to control the game
this wa conveniently encapsulated in the first try
wale characteristically delayed the heel at a scrum putting robert jones in trouble when the ball finally emerged
he wa scragged by mike budd jeremy cooper came away with the ball owain williams acted a the link and kevin elli scored three forward and their in perfect harmony
wale instant reaction a try by arthur emyr and subsequent steady improvement bringing try for emyr and robert jones promised more than wa later fulfilled
in the third quarter bridgend had little difficulty in wiping out an deficit huw bevan supporting aled williams break for their second try
it wa a magnificent fightback and such wa welsh distress that they never looked like preventing it
we have taken a step backward ryan said and on this sorry evidence it look a if it will be backwards all the way when the test take place at cardiff arm park on november
a the welsh squad do not meet again until october time ha all but run out
football hazard hint at the missing gift
by patrick barclay
how to describe saturday match between chelsea and arsenal
well i seem to recall a london gallery exhibiting a pile of rubbish which wa considered valid art by the proprietor and drew a large attendance
the only redeeming feature of a goalless worthless event at stamford bridge wa that it did not require a grant
yet the chelsea manager bobby campbell and arsenal assistant theo foley agreed it had been a good match and the spectator complaint were muted
some even applauded the player at the end
it take all sort
bobby robson wa there to ass world cup candidate but nothing positive emerged from minute of scuffling that made one almost yearn for the more measured boredom of ranger european cup exit in munich three day earlier
at least the outcome wa appropriate
had either of the team won they would have taken the league leadership
instead liverpool stayed top without kicking a ball
television had postponed manchester united scheduled visit to anfield so it could be shown live on december the longest night
london leading pair a if piqued by this turned september into the longest afternoon
on and on it dragged
lacking a goal that might have altered it chemistry it remained a matter of dull physic
yet many of the crowd were kept interested by the possibility of victory which is i suppose what derby are about
they are so frequent these day in london which ha eight of first division club that we must expect aesthetic consideration to be overridden
why though could these supposed championship contender not have tried to emulate the fine passing that had sprinkled the previous weekend merseyside joust
the simple answer is that chelsea are in a false position and arsenal on this evidence slightly jaded champion
they ought to have pocketed three point in the first but tony adam a more threatening on his foray than the current alan smith missed the target with two header and david rocastle let dave beasant save a penalty much a the keeper had done for wimbledon in the fa cup final
now an arsenal team in peak health would have kept a grip on the match
this one could not
a george graham indicated upon his side accession to the title they would need more composure and sophistication to match liverpool in the longer term
he chose not to hasten the process by buying
after all he had just the man on his staff
but paul davis remains unfit
his absence is increasingly conspicuous and liverpool for the moment in a super league of one
davis of course would have walked into england team in poland a week on wednesday until last season prolonged suspension followed by injury bobby robson had him firmly pencilled in a bryan robson replacement
michael thomas several year younger is not quite in the same class yet but may have to play in chorzow
if so it will be a gamble because he flopped on his only previous international appearance in saudi arabia
the odds are favourable enough according to chelsea mike hazard who said of his adversary he could cope in poland not just because of his ability to close people down and use the ball well but temperament you saw when he scored the goal that won arsenal the league
very kind but international player are supposed to be habitually influential and it wa hazard who in the second half with a few incisive pass gift from the heaven on a day like this left a greater mark
chelsea might have won had the ball not kept turning into a mexican bean at kerry dixon foot
campbell side are still trying to sort out their system which involves a spare defender and a far a one can see a good deal of improvisation
it should suit tony dorigo the unblooded england though oddly his rival nigel winterburn did more rampaging on saturday neither in truth made the heart pound
dorigo at least had the satisfaction of seeing his direct opponent and england colleague david rocastle withdrawn
all in all bobby robson must have found it about a fruitful a a day trying to get in touch with brian clough
there wa however one aspect that deserves commendation
after minute graham robert wa injured by a tackle for which perry grove wa booked steve clarke took over a sweeper and is likely to have several week in which to build on a promising display
robert ankle appeared broken but the chelsea player were not interested in retribution and the club a soon a they knew the injury wa le serious put a message on the electronic scoreboard an example of public relation from which others could learn
pope reject runcie vision of church leadership
from andrew brown religious affair correspondent in rome
the archbishop of canterbury dr robert runcie exchanged a symbolic kiss of peace with pope john paul ii yesterday at a mass attended by thousand in st peter square rome
but dr runcie idea of a limited primacy recognising the pope a a central figure in the christian church who would exercise a primacy for the sake of unity and mission have been rejected a insufficient by the pope
they have also aroused protestant anger against dr runcie at the same time a he ha become involved in a row over his attack on the pharisee of british society
though dr runcie and his party could not take holy communion at the papal mass he had earlier celebrated the eucharist at the anglican church in rome after three demonstrator rose from the congregation a he ascended the pulpit the visit ha been dogged by protest from supporter of the rev ian paisley
in his sermon dr runcie said we should ever recognise the scandal that anglican and roman catholic must celebrate two eucharist to make one memorial of our redemption on the day of our lord
dr runcie ha gone out of his way on this visit to concede many of the doctrinal point and practice which large element of the church of england have traditionally found offensive in roman catholicism
the pope too ha spoken warmly of unity
on saturday the two prelate attended a service of vesper at the church of san gregorio which stand on the site where pope gregory sent st augustine of canterbury off to become the first archbishop of canterbury in
but in their prepared homily the pope and the archbishop addressed quite different problem
dr runcie repeated his offer of a limited primacy involving the limited power exercised by the pope in the first few century of the christian church
however the pope account of the role of the papacy went a great deal farther than that christian unity he said must be founded on the faith in christ that wa handed on by the apostle what this faith is must be determined by the roman catholic church
he quoted the second vatican council the task of giving an authentic interpretation of the word of god ha been entrusted to the living teachting office of the church alone
the specific role of bishop which is to be exercised in communion with the see of peter in ensuring the unity and continuity of the faith is vital if we are to hand on the faith of peter gregory and augustine
all our effort to restore unity among christian will be in vain if they are not carried out in total fidelity to the faith in christ handed on by the apostle
in a statement afterwards dr runcie stressed that he wa not proposing any change in the british constitution
the phrase universal primacy ha a spiritual meaning
it doe not imply political supremacy and doe not suggest that the pope should administer the affair of the church of england he said
both prelate referred to the consecration in february of the rt rev barbara harris a the anglican assistant bishop of massachussetts
bishop harris is quite unacceptable to the vatican
the pope said event in recent year have seriously aggravated the difference between u
the independent ha learnt that american roman catholic nun wrote last winter to dr runcie urging him to defy the pope over the ordination of woman
sister margaret traxler of the national coalition of american nun said that she had told dr runcie the roman catholic church say this is a deterrent to unity but we say how can this be a deterrent to unity when discrimination against woman is evil
she said she had received a friendly and brotherly reply from dr runcie
labour would keep tight rein on spending
by anthony bevin political editor
john smith the shadow chancellor yesterday set the overriding tone for this week labour party conference with a warning that he would impose tough spending control if labour won the next election
his warning cast doubt on labour commitment to increase spending on priority programme for the health service and pension
mr smith said in an interview on bbc television on the record that he did not expect his colleague to spend and spend again when they took office
he conceded that there would be dispute with colleague but said there are no quick fix and i will not be indulging in any quick fix
a quick fix clearly becomes unfixed
there are reality that i can not change
there will be the reality of the economic situation which we inherit which will not be our fault but it will be our responsibility
now if that mean we have to postpone some of our social ambition then we may have to do so
but it will not mean that we are abandoning them
we will tackle putting our economy in order so that we can achieve that social ambition so that the strong economy is used to finance and develop the fair society
a for his colleague mr smith said we all agreed that we can not spend what we have not earned and we intend to earn it before we spend it
that will be the guiding light of the next labour government
when i insist on that priority a i can tell you i most certainly will with the full support of the prime minister in doing so then i sure my colleague will see the point of that
now it is quite right of them of course to allow our social obligation not to be forgotten there probably be an argument
there are in all government between the treasury and spending minister
but they will take into account the need for that balance that say that social spending without underpinning by economic growth will not be sustained in any event
mr smith warning coincided with a call by ken livingstone the labour mp for brent east who said on london weekend television the walden interview you can be mile ahead in the poll but when you get to the last three week people think can i afford a labour government
we need to say now what we are going to spend where the money is going to come from
mr livingstone called for cut in defence spending
david blunkett another member of the national executive told a conference fringe rally organised by the labour coordinating committee that labour would have to find additional fund for it social programme by cutting from defence spending over five year and raising the level of taxation on the rich
the policy review top rate of income tax per cent wa too low he said
although the policy review will be endorsed by the conference giving neil kinnock the freedom to go on to the offensive against the conservative in the to the next general election there are a number of area of potential conflict
call for consideration of electoral reform and a new form of black representation are both expected to be defeated
ron todd the general secretary of the transport worker union said that today vote on the multilaterist nuclear defence policy would not yield the massive and overwhelming majority predicted by and he warned that party leader could not expect everybody to in the same direction once the policy had been carried
the conference opened with labour buoyed by a series of weekend opinion poll giving lead of from to point

by olivia timbs
there is much concern in the u about the addiction to crack purified cocaine within community
doctor are worried that woman turning to prostitution to finance the habit are at risk of contracting aid
this problem ha spread to the uk
in the past two month doctor at the regional addiction treatment unit in birmingham have come across five patient addicted to crack
three are prostitute introduced to the drug by pimp
according to them crack is widely available in birmingham and most prostitute they know use it daily
the doctor point out in the british medical journal that though crack dependency is not a direct risk factor for aid prostitute trying to maintain expensive crack habit may be tempted into unsafe sex practice which in turn may lead to an increase in the spread of aid
health update zinc deficiency in pregnancy
by olivia timbs
fad for vitamin supplement have been overtaken by a vogue for mineral and trace element
zinc is the latest lack of it supposedly cause a range of problem although little scientific evidence support the link
but some report have suggested that low zinc level may lead to problem in pregnancy from difficult labour to congenital malformation in child
there is stronger evidence that a zinc deficiency may cause the foetus to grow slowly in the womb
doctor in bristol decided to test the theory
in a study of nearly woman they found that zinc supplement did not improve either foetal health or reduce the number of labour
the doctor conclude in the british medical journal that there would be little benefit if all woman in the uk were given zinc supplement during pregnancy
they recognise however that the woman in their study were largely who might well have sufficiently large zinc store because they were well nourished
further study the researcher believe should concentrate on pregnant woman known to have a zinc deficiency or to be at risk from problem during labour
health alternative cure not proven
by olivia timbs
renee henry underwent a lumpectomy and radiotherapy for her breast cancer
dr maurice slevin a consultant physician at the department of medical oncology at st bartholomew hospital london said the chance of a woman being alive and well four year after such treatment were at least per cent
mr henry refused the drug treatment given to reduce the chance of a relapse but there are many who would remain well without it dr slevin said
part of the attraction of alternative cancer treatment such a the gerson therapy is that they allow a patient to feel more in control of the treatment
dr slevin agreed that this is often beneficial but is concerned about other aspect of such therapy
very few have been evaluated and the evidence is largely anecdotal he said
some of the treatment have dramatic
if they do work that is wonderful but we have no way of knowing for sure
there have been no controlled trial of the gerson therapy
if one of my patient want to give up a potentially curative treatment in favour of an alternative therapy then i will try to dissuade them
but it is essentially upto the patient
he said the nh should address itself more to the need of cancer patient so that they do not feel they have to go outside the system
they should be offered relaxation therapy and stress management and advice on diet and exercise he said
the imperial cancer research fund and the cancer research campaign are conducting a joint study of the bristol cancer help centre which offer a holistic programme dietary advice and emotional counselling to complement medical treatment
medium return of the saga modern actor can not ride and young viewer do not understand the cowboy code but a revival of the western loom on the horizon john lichfield say
by john lichfield
where are the tv western of yesteryear
what happened to ben cartwright ho and little joe
where is the wagon train that seemed permanently to be circling it wagon waiting for a drunken pioneer wife to have twin in the last of them
the tv western seemed to fade into the sunset some time in the victim of a narcissistic age that preferred to look at prosperous or violent image of itself dallas cheer miami vice
it wa a time when child were encouraged to fantasize about machine and outer space rather than marvel at the open space where the deer and buffalo roamed
now however it seems the wheel ha turned full circle
the western is being revived reinterpreted for the
one of the most successful hollywood tv producer david jacob the creator of dallas belief the western also fell victim to late iconoclasm
the john wayne stereotype wa rejected along with his conservative value he said
a series of spoof or obsessively realistic western cat balou butch cassidy and the sundance kid soldier blue the wild bunch stripped the mask from the lone ranger face
the legend could not be taken seriously any longer in what had been admittedly a threadbare form
howard rosenberg tv critic of the los angeles time said just look at the of the old western series
you had hero to their horse and lightly sprinkled with dust
you ca get away with that any more
john mantley producer of gunsmoke for cbs for year say element of the old story began to fall apart
we all read bury my heart at wounded knee
we knew that the u government had signed treaty with the indian and broken every one
a part of the myth just did work after that
at their peak in the there were western series on the three american tv network almost two a day on each channel
in the u weekly audience rating in there were three western in the top five and seven in the top
by the they had all gone the way of the buffalo extinct save for preservation in the national park of permanent
gene autry the first tv cowboy now say western dominated the early day of tv partly because they had lively cheaply produced visuals but mainly because early tv wa starved of feature film by the studio
western were a handy substitute
there are encouraging sign however that the tv western is struggling back into the saddle
paradise launched on cbs last season and shown on this summer wa the first new western serial for a decade
it wa the only new drama series in u network tv to be allowed a second series this year despite a relatively lowly ranking in the rating
it creator and executive producer is perhaps surprisingly david jacob
why did he follow j r ewing the epitome of tv with a western about a gunfighter turned foster father
i believed the genre wa still an important and powerful one
it something i always had an affection for
i found it wa possible with paradise to talk about individual and personal responsibility something which if set in a contemporary context would have had a preachy feel about it
lonesome dove a story of a cattle drive also shown on cbs last year wa the tv of any kind in america for five year
it won substantial critical acclaim and will show in britain next year
the season which started this month brought another new western series abc young rider which tell the story of the pony express
it also say a lot about modern american tv
because the network believe western appeal mainly to men young rider ha a cast of five pouting young male actor in an attempt to make a western with good demographic
the effect is rather like an extended advertisement for marlboro light
western are no longer a cheap option
the classic western tv series were filmed in or in the mile from los angeles
modern audience no longer accept plastic bush and the southern californian suburban sprawl mean the production company have to take their horse and cow to location far away in arizona or montana
david jacob also point out that the cost of hiring a is now prohibitive
at one time there were dozen of company which specialised in renting out western paraphernalia
now there are maybe two
the cost ha gone through the barn roof
and actor can no longer ride
they have to be sent to cowboy school
western by their nature demand more time on location
a a result mr jacob say it cost nearly a much to make an episode of paradise with relatively unknown actor a an episode of dallas with it big star
will the western ride again
john mantley is cautious
western have a gladiatorial timeless quality
on the other hand you have a whole generation of tv watcher that doe really know the rule
a western is like a japanese noh play
it is a stylised drama with understated dialogue that depends on recognition of key word and concept
many of the young people today have the first idea of what going on
in the inert the western represented a troubled adventurous american past
in the anxious and eventful late and they may come to represent like all creature great and small in britain a le confusing past with simpler deeper value
maybe
on the other hand the young rider came in the rating in it first week trailing far far behind all the modern myth about modern time such a the cosby show roseanne golden girl cheer and matlock
it is premature then to say that the western ha galloped back to centre screen
but there is a puff of dust on the horizon
motoring a lover guide to used car driver with a tight budget and an environmental conscience can buy without losing principle say james ruppert
by james ruppert
from this month all new car submitted for british type approval the test which allows them to be legally sold in the uk must be able to run on petrol
a a result of this rule and many carefully orchestrated publicity campaign the motor industry image ha now changed from polluter to pal of the earth
if you can afford an environmentally friendly runabout then the flora fauna and child of the british isle will have a lot to thank you for
but if you have a tight budget and a conscience running older car on fuel becomes a much more complicated issue
without the presence of a lead compound an engine valve seat go unprotected
this lead to premature wear and plume of blue smoke spewing from the exhaust
the only effective remedy is to install hardened valve seat or a replacement cylinder head both expensive option
le costly but not entirely satisfactory is the practice of making every fourth tankful leaded petrol which protects the valve seat but rather defeat the object
alternatively there are several chemical additive on the market which aim to provide a substitute for lead although the case for these product ha yet to be proved
however many car built within the last few year have hardened valve seat or alloy cylinder head that need little simply a retune or no modification to use unleaded petrol
finding out which car can and which can not is not difficult
esso filling station have a free booklet listing most model produced since a doe the charity clear with more detail available in the unleaded petrol guide autodale
looking at those list provides interesting reading and bear out the trade view that having a car could prove to be a liability
it is not a if leaded fuel is going to be phased out tomorrow but more and more buyer are asking doe it take unleaded
what is certain is that the range all skodas yugos and quite a few lancias do not which doe not help already depressed resale price
a lancia lead only sell for around whereas the similar fiat uno from the same year converted to run on unleaded is worth around more
a car is now worth about per cent le than an unleaded equivalent
in year to come the percentage difference is likely to be much larger
even so exotica such a porsche and ferraris are unlikely to be part of this trend so no bargain there i afraid
more impressive are the japanese manufacturer whose car dating from the early eighty can run on unleaded without adjustment
find a toyota corolla or nissan sunny that ha not succumbed to rust and you can buy with confidence
on the home front most ford and vauxhalls from at least the can use unleaded
if the greenness of going unleaded still seems a bit of a grey area it is possible to switch to diesel without a shadow of environmental doubt
diesel always ha been and the only adjustment you need to make are mental one because car are no longer slow smelly or noisy
they also return more mile to the gallon than their petrol equivalent although service interval are shorter
but after the publicity on unleaded fuel there ha been increased interest in used diesel power
but remember that these car accrue and can withstand significantly higher mileage than petrol car being the norm
the tradition for diesel car is far better established on the continent and that is where the best buy come from
perhaps the most successful maker is peugeot with a complete range of car from the small around for a car to the legendary estate about for a example
the german are also fairly accomplished manufacturer although a golf with a mileage will still cost
prestige come in the shape of a mercedes with the or stuttgart taxi commanding but returning unfailing reliability
even if lead level in the atmosphere do not bother you i am sure you will find the fact that unleaded petrol is cheaper and that diesel fuel boost mpg by at least a third most interesting

how did you feel a you came to the end of your working week yesterday afternoon
boy i had a thirst
we say we are thirsty when we mean that we fancy a glass of wine a pint of beer a gin and tonic or a shot of whisky the pleasure of naming our poison at the end of a busy day or tiresome week
that is not thirst
to enjoy it we do not need to be dry just in need of a restorative or relaxant or maybe a focus for a social moment or brief encounter
we call it thirst in lieu of a more accurate description
no not more accurate thirst is not accurate at all a a description for this apparently indescribable condition
it is a desire million of u know and share yet for which we have no name
this desire that can not find it name though it would dare speak it if it could is pleasurable
it is a enjoyable a feeling gently hungry or amorous
no not amorous randy we have a word for that
any of these condition is pleasurable so long a there is a good likelihood of satisfaction in reasonably short order
let puritan and pessimist damn disapprove or dismiss these appetite that is their loss
those of u who enjoy them need only a name for each condition so that we may discus them in expectation and in recollection
come to think of it neither hunger nor randiness hit quite the spot
peckishness and lust perhaps
or doe that sound like a firm of country solicitor
this is to digress
what of this thirst that can be satisfied by an unquenching drink
wine is not quenching but no le in demand for that
try to quench your thirst with a light fresh white and you will drink enough to put you on your back
beer is quite rightly britain favourite friday night drink
it can momentarily blunt a thirst but not altogether cut it
the nearest to being quenching is the white beer of berlin
anything with even a modest smack of hop dry the palate ready for the next one
so of course doe alcohol itself
it may for a moment seem to quench but it dehydrates a purportedly healthy abstainer are forever telling me
to quench is more than to refresh although our lying lascivious eye tell u the two are the same
doe any drink look more quenching than one of those italian or french patent aperitif swirling in a refractive pink or russet oiliness clothing the melting ice a campari dubonnet lillet or too rare in this country a picon
are they quenching
no refreshing
in strasburg they have been known to lace beer with picon thereby ruining both drink a queen victoria reputedly did with claret and malt whisky but still the result is not especially quenching
perhaps a shimmering dry martini cocktail minimum dilution stirred not shaken and served straight up look even more refreshing though it effect is that of a silver mallet
in the right place possibly new york but san francisco is better the martini is the ultimate thank god it friday drink
the requirement for such pleasure is a matter of time and place and it doe not have to be friday berlin or strasburg new york or san francisco
not feeling thirsty but fancying a drink ha a world of moment
some frenchman start the day with a coffee and calvados
the people of munich call their version of weissbier breakfast beer and have it with a pair of coddled veal sausage
new orleans favour a milk punch or it own variation on the gin fizz
if the moment is before a lunch on the plane it really ought to be a bloody mary
if it is at an elegant dinner table there is a choice between a fino sherry or a manzanilla or champagne
none of these requires anything even approaching a thirst
do we really wash down a good meal with claret
port is immediately suggested by stilton cognac by coffee
i do not fully appreciate the experience of an american movie without a bourbon or a book at bedtime without a single malt
these are not moment of thirst but nor are they cause of drunkenness unless one try to pack all such experience into one day
we do not drink because we are thirsty
nor if we are in civilised cast of mind because we wish to become drunk
a friend of mine say that her body tell her without being asked the season of the year
at the end of summer her body stop wanting gin and tonic and suddenly desire whisky
if it were only a matter of alcohol would a body care
people will nevertheless say that the desire is for nothing more than alcohol
so why not a pill or an injection
because there would be no colour no ritual no time and place no glorious variety
worst of all there would be no aroma taste texture or finish
these are sensuous pleasure at their most enjoyable when we ritualise them but how do we feel when we desire them
we who have so many word in our language have none for this
but then do the french spanish or italian have a word for it
perhaps they do maybe i have not being paying attention too busy with the ani or grappa
do the greek have a word for it
could we borrow beg or invent one
answer in a bottle please
if you are feeling for lack of a better word let meet again next month
same time same place
it will be my turn to get them in i think
in the garden planning to beat a leafy retreat at home in the first of a series for novice gardener anna pavord stress the value of careful forethought
by anna pavord
plant should come a long way down the list of priority for the novice gardener
there are many thing to think about before even the first tentative daffodil bulb is sunk into the ground
the first and most important question to mull over a you gaze at your patch is what is this garden for
if you start writing down some of the response to that question you will find you have along the way acquired a ragbag of element that will have an important bearing on the design
if there are small child in the equation there will need to be a flat soft area where they can fall off swing and climbing frame
if you like hanging out washing rather than drying it in the bowel of an expensive machine you will need to tuck away a line and make a dry path to get to and from it
some novice gardener may not want to do much actual gardening at all but conversely do not want to look out every day over a scene of threadbare grass and rotting fence
their ideal garden will look good and demand little attention
if you are a dedicated you need to mark out the part of the garden where the sun lingers longest
it may not be the part nearest the house though this is where sitting out area always tend to be made
you may even a a novice care so passionately about plant that all you want is the maximum space to grow them in
raised bed built down an unpromising alley could provide extra gardening space
privacy is an important consideration
a first time garden is usually small and certainly the typical one i am imagining for this series is no more than x and surrounded on all side by other house
privacy is a ticklish business where close neighbour are concerned
to throw up an impenetrable berlin wall between you and them could be tactless
trellis is a useful compromise and you can always pretend it wa forced on you by the speed of growth of your climbing rose
aesthete among the novice will by now be thoroughly irritable and complaining that garden should have a much to do with the soul a with the necessity or not of a washing line or a barbecue pit
so they should and when the list of necessity is securely written down you can ask the second question how do i want this garden to feel
this question produce a varied a response a the first
some urban gardener a short of space inside a they are out want their garden to be extension of their home with a great deal of hard paving good furniture and lighting
the garden for them should feel like an extra sitting room perhaps damp occasionally but an important overflow of living space
closet countrysiders may want to pretend their patch is actually a corner of some sussex meadow and picture it swagged with honeysuckle and waving with daisy and scabious
this is a difficult trick to bring off with suburban train hurtling by on one side and lorry grinding through their gear on the other
a leafy retreat is an excellent goal for a small town garden but it is best made acknowledging the urban setting using plant such a bamboo acanthus fig vine alchemilla euphorbia wisteria
while you are working through this process take note of the feature in the garden that you would like to keep
on a new estate there may be nothing
in an old garden there may be a fruit tree or a good bulwark of evergreen laurel or box that tidied up could add a dash of venerability to the new garden that will emerge around it
if you do not know what a tree or shrub is exercise clemency and give it a year grace to demonstrate it worth before you turn it over to the axeman
the mood of the garden will dictate it eventual style
it may be clipped classical random cottage modern or some intensely personal vision of byzantium that no one ha ever imagined before but which exists in your head and want to get out
do not let anybody particularly gardening writer tread on your dream
all this thinking and doodling will have done nothing physically to change the view outside the window but it is a vital part of the gardening process
before you can make you have to know what it is you are making
property house that are going going gone fed up with trying to sell more people are auctioning their home instead
andrew bibby report
by andrew bibby
in the small devon town of south molton julie widlake is waiting with anticipation for friday october
she and her boyfriend have had their future planned for some time they want to start farming in a nearby village where they also intend to build a bungalow
first they have to sell their present house a cottage in the centre of the town
a is the case almost everywhere else the market in devon is depressed and selling ha not been easy
so instead of waiting indefinitely for a buyer they have decided to try selling their house by auction
it come under the hammer at on the at the barnstaple motel
we accept that we might not get very much for it but on the other hand we could get more say julie widlake
we been waiting to move for a long time and we need the money to build the new house
their south molton cottage guide price is one of more than lot to be put up for sale at the barnstaple auction by bristol and west property service and one of more than a hundred which the building society subsidiary will be auctioning in eight west country venue over a period
bristol and west claim these auction will help to bring some action to an otherwise slow market and say it wa overwhelmed by the response from people wanting to sell in this way
auction certainly speed up the process
once the hammer ha fallen the successful bidder for a house must exchange contract immediately and pay a deposit
completion normally take place four to eight week later and there is no opportunity for second thought
a the bristol and west explains if a bidder doe not sign the contract the auctioneer can sign on their behalf
from the vendor point of view the house is actually sold once a successful bid is made say graham harrison director of bristol and west property service
many people have suffered from sale falling through and from chain and some of our vendor feel that now a good a time a any to sell
from the purchaser point of view auction can also be attractive if slightly a you wait for bidding to start for the house of your dream
the problem is that normally potential purchaser have to incur the expense of undertaking survey and arranging mortgage finance without any idea whether they will be able to afford the final selling price
not surprisingly several estate agent report difficulty at the moment in attracting enough serious bidder
with an auction you got to be certain that at least two buyer are there who can commit themselves and the difficulty is that buyer who can proceed are few and far between said david phillip a director of yorkshire estate agent dacre son and hartley
bristol and west hope that by arranging collective auction it will be able to overcome this problem
it is also guaranteeing mortgage at per cent below the normal interest rate for endowment or policy on several of the house up for sale an interesting and innovative service for bidder mortgage survey will already have been undertaken for these house
the building society will be staffing a mortgage desk at each auction and say buyer could arrange finance there and then subject of course to proof of income and status
obviously however bristol and west hope to hear from interested people in advance if only so it can gauge the likely demand for each property before the auction start
we trying to smooth the path for purchaser and streamline the system say graham harrison pointing out that live telephone bidding will also be available for those unable to attend
holiday home and commercial property have been included among the lot to be auctioned
although collective property auction take place regularly in london often primarily for investor rather than in country area the more typical auction will be just for one house and a likely a not will take place in a nearby pub or village hall
in fact country auction are often the nearest many village get to live theatre
the local come for the entertainment and to see who buying into their village observed one
pub landlord are usually only too happy to provide free accommodation
it very exciting and get the adrenalin going say david phillip whose firm usually undertakes auction in the otley area
only certain type of property normally come to auction however
traditionally country cottage and house which have unusual or unique feature or are in need of a lot of renovation may be auctioned if only because valuation is likely to be difficult
sometimes too house have to be sold by auction to satisfy the legal requirement of trustee or executor auction provide adequate proof that the property ha been sold at the going market value and protect trustee from future claim of negligence
le happily but for the same reason repossessed house are often auctioned
anyone considering selling by auction need to be aware that the cost involved will be higher
advertising cost and any expense incurred in hiring premise are normally passed on by the estate agent to the vendor whether or not the auction result in a sale
in addition agent may charge slightly more commission than usual for a successful sale
in bristol and west forthcoming auction a set fee of plus vat will be charged to everyone entering property to sell with it usual agent commission about per cent plus vat charged on top when sale are made
we accept that we could lose the money we paid to go to auction but that a risk we prepared to take say julie widlake
the secret of a successful outcome depends partly on setting the right reserve price a task the auctioneer undertakes in conjunction with the seller
normally the reserve is set only day or hour before the auction when the agent will already have a good indication of how much interest ha been shown
too high a reserve price can mean no sale and disappointment all round
you need to understand what your client expectation are beforehand say graham harrison of bristol and west
agent and their client may also have the dilemma of deciding whether to accept any offer made prior to the auction
inevitably they do not always get it right
peter crowther managing director of a leeds business centre recently bought two stone cottage in bramhope on the outskirt of leeds at an auction in the village pub
his successful bid wa for although he had made a higher prior offer which had been turned down
on the other hand sometimes the drama of the auction and the competition between bidder can have the opposite effect
another recent auction in leeds saw a stone farmhouse without water or other amenity finally fall under the hammer for
success is by no mean guaranteed at auction say graham harrison
in a tough market you need to get the programme right the price right and have a little bit of luck
bristol and west property service ha produced a brochure covering all eight west country auction
the church built on wool angela lambert enjoys the rich at the heart of east anglia
by angela lambert
until six or seven year ago outsider associated east anglia with fen flatness and the vanished edwardian nanny of frinton
it old church green field and long beach were cherished by the inhabitant of essex suffolk norfolk and cambridgeshire but not yet on the tourist agenda
today i wa told villager living around the great wool church of lavenham and long melford have to bar their door and ignore the knocking of tourist who take them for antique shop and offer to buy their furniture
the tourist are right
east anglia on a sunny weekend is a place of matchless beauty
it village look too good to be true
lavenham and long melford for example have no telegraph pole to preserve the timeless air that pervades them
yet you only have to read ronald blythe akenfield to realise that these picturesque cottage often painted the characteristic essex pink pale salmon ochre or green are more prosperous now than ever in the real past
many are still elaborately decorated with pargeting an ornate patterned plasterwork practised in this area since the early thirteenth century
most of east anglia prosperity today is due to city commuter the market and tourism
the ideal hotel from which to explore is dedham hall set among tall tree in the vale of dedham looking directly across towards dedham church on one side and flatford mill on the other both painted by constable
the hotel lie in five acre of field and garden and the slingos who own it make the most of their beautiful surroundings by running painting course for about a week including breakfast and dinner or for a long weekend
these are so popular that you will need to book at least a couple of month in advance
the other great joy of dedham hall is the food
the slingos have their own vegetable garden chicken duck sheep and cow
everything is and fresh it taste like forgotten food
if dedham hall is fully booked and it may well be try the best we have ever found just a few mile away at the old vicarage higham near colchester
it is a rambling tudor house run by john and margaret parker whose breakfast room and drawing room look out over a wonderful walled garden beyond which field of grazing cow stretch down to the river
another hotel that would make a good starting point for a weekend or longer in east anglia is the black lion at long melford
it changed hand recently and is now run by stephen and janet errington
after dinner there when the moon wa full and low and deep orange we walked up the road from the hotel to long melford church
it vast wall of flint and glass and gothic tracery were brilliantly floodlit and the churchyard cat sleek and black a tar greeted u querulously and led u right round the church and through the gravestone at the back glimmering and pale in the moonlight
we were quite alone and the great church the size of a cathedral wa unearthly in it floodlit moonlit beauty
long melford is one of the wool church that commemorate the wealth of east anglia in the fifteenth and sixteenth century
another is at lavenham minute drive up the road
just inside the front porch a handwritten book is prefaced with the word this book ha been compiled that something more than their mere name may be known of the lavenham men who gave their life for their country in the great war
this is followed by or so name each with a description
the book is deeply moving and set the tone for a walk round this glorious building which ha seen the christening marriage and burial of the folk of the village for more than year
east anglia is exceptionally rich in church and cathedral
there are several splendid house near long melford that would make for a gentle afternoon potter through the room and possession of the rich of a few century ago
the loveliest to my mind is melford hall whose charming octagonal jacobean gatehouse is reached along an avenue of clipped yew tree and with it high window flooding the octagon with light is my fantasy of the ideal study
lavenham is often called the finest medieval village in england
it is an image of the world we have lost it gently sloping street converging upon the market place
here stand the early timbered guildhall now a museum to year of the cloth industry
next to it is the little hall dating from the fourteenth century with it floorboard gleaming with the patina of age ceiling and a tiny unruly charming walled garden
precisely next door to this is a restaurant called the great house
here in the cool pretty setting of the dining room that wa once stephen spender you will be served an exquisite lunch for for child
the wine list is small but perfectly chosen
the service is impeccable
east anglia ha bookshop filled with title like thing for a boy to do
constable landscape
gainsborough house to say nothing of huge grey sweep of empty beach from which at aldeburgh you can buy skate direct from the fishing boat a they come out of the water
it ha colchester oyster
it ha ely cathedral it great green window casting a translucent light across the lady chapel
with all this small wonder it also ha tourist
a prayer for the brick cathedral facing st paul bankside power station is a masterpiece worth preserving gavin stamp argues
by gavin stamp
from the top of the dome of st paul cathedral the view is no longer dominated by city church steeple but by an intrusive cacophony of drab characterless sixty box
one building stand out in this dispiriting panorama of mediocrity a dark powerful mass of brickwork with a tall central tower that stand right across the thames from wren dome
this is not an office block nor a church although it sublime form might suggest that it architect wa adept at designing cathedral
it is in fact the now redundant electric power station that sits on bankside next to the site of sam wanamaker new globe theatre
bankside power station should never have been built
it architect had spent the war year with fellow royal academician planning the orderly and spacious london of the future free of smoke and industry
but when asked in to replace an old dirty power station that had been on the site since he soon forgot such idealism and like any architect wa glad to have the job
the project wa controversial and the power station wa only permitted providing the smoke wa clean and the building did not challenge the visual dominance of st paul
so the single chimney rose only to some below the height of the cross above the cathedral
the irony is that had the tower been higher and had the teak scrubber been le efficient the smoke would have gone straight up into the air
a it wa the smokeless shimmer of vapour wa so cooled by cleaning that it drifted across the river to cause mischief with the leadwork on wren great dome
bankside power station should not have been built
but a it wa built it should not now be demolished
that is because it is a magnificent structure the supreme architectural expression of the heroic monumental phase of power station design and the creation of a great architect
bankside wa the work of sir giles gilbert scott om the architect of liverpool anglican cathedral the rebuilt house of common and some of the last vital product of the gothic revival
he wa a designer of extraordinary versatility being responsible for the standard traditional red telephone kiosk waterloo bridge and several power station
bankside represents the fullest realisation of his industrial aesthetic
scott first venture into this unlikely field of design wa at battersea where in he wa wheeled in a a famous knighted architect by the london power company to try to make acceptable the monster power station to which the resident of chelsea and westminster were taking strong exception
this wa a brilliant move
scott wa so successful in styling the building in fine brickwork with fluting a john betjeman called it that when the battersea a station wa opened in it wa widely acclaimed a a supremely successful modern treatment of a building type that seemed quintessentially twentieth century
when in the architect journal conducted a survey to find what were considered the best modern building in britain battersea wa placed second and wa the favourite of such unlikely celebrity a sir kenneth clark rebecca west and charles laughton
scott wa so pleased with the style he had evolved at battersea a treatment that humanised industrial form without denying their function that he also used it on the guinness factory at park royal west london
at battersea scott could not alter the basic design of the building and he much disliked the upturned table appearance created by the four corner chimney
at bankside however he wa able to persuade the engineer mott hay anderson to gather all the flue into a single slender tower or campanile
a a result he wa able to create a symmetrical monumental composition of great power
a at all his power station scott faced the building in a fine worcestershire brick that ha weathered to a lovely
but there is nothing homely about the general effect
vast overlapping plane of brickwork are modelled with careful and subtle band of detail
the result is an expression of the monumental aesthetic of the early twentieth century with strong american overtone
when the campanile is seen from a distance it seems to belong to some strange expressionist church one ha not noticed before
not for nothing were such power station described a brick cathedral bankside is the finest manifestation of this tradition
now it is redundant
smoke shimmer no longer from the tall tower
but bankside is nevertheless a sound structure which like the best mill of the industrial revolution is well worth preserving and is perfectly capable of adaptation for a new commercial use
such is of course much encouraged by a building being listed something which until recently wa not possible with architecture of so recent a date
two year ago however the department of the environment at last began the listing of building in england that were more than year old
bracken house the former home of the financial time became the first candidate and english heritage then submitted some recommendation to the department of the environment these included bankside
this however wa too much for the government and using the excuse that public opinion wa not yet ready to accept the protection of many unpopular modern building lord caithness the minister of state for the environment arbitrarily whittled down english heritage list to building excluding bankside although it represented a more traditional approach in the fifty to the modern movement
however caithness himself stated that this first selection wa in no way a definitive list
i have no doubt that others will be added
the important thing is that the thirty year rule is in force and that we can respond to developing perception of our time
earlier this year in my capacity a chairman of the thirty society i asked caithness successor virginia bottomley to reconsider english heritage recommendation of bankside for listing
my argument wa that a michael heseltine had so boldly listed battersea power station in it wa illogical not to protect a much finer and more complete industrial work by the same architect
furthermore the listing of battersea had ensured the building survival for conversion to a new use in that case a an entertainment centre which the prime minister herself had praised and inaugurated
after two month silence i wa informed that minister stood by their decision
i wrote back asking the reason for this pointing out that if any large modern power station deserved to be listed it wa bankside
i have received no satisfactory reply
of course i know perfectly well why the department of the environment decline to list it
listed building procedure might impede the full commercial realisation of the site when the electricity industry is privatised
furthermore british rail ha it eye on the bankside site for bringing up the spoil from the tunnel for channel traffic which it is so absurdly driving under the middle of london at astronomical cost
listing in theory is an objective assessment of architectural or historical importance which doe not necessarily prevent demolition
in the case of bankside power station the ultimate temple of power and a masterpiece of industrial architecture by a major british architect our historic building system is being perverted for purely political reason
her dress hang here the kahlo cult
oriana baddeley
the have witnessed a shift in the art establishment attitude towards art produced outside of it traditional parameter
the work of previously marginalised artist ha become an area of rich speculation among art dealer priced out of the modern master market
almost every year ha witnessed the discovery of new artistic terrain graffiti art soviet art australian art the art of latin america
the major auction house have moved with the time and have found new way of selling work which in both form and content would have proved an unstable investment a decade ago
the current status of the work of the mexican painter frida kahlo is a dramatic example of this change
once known primarily a the wife of diego rivera her reputation outside of mexico now far supercedes his since sale room estimate of her work have risen from to over million and in a work by kahlo broke all record at sotheby new york for a latin american artist
the enormous rise in the economic value of her work ha developed in tandem with the increased critical and popular response to her particular blend of naive style and incisive content
while the first wave of popular interest arose with the whitechapel exhibition instigated by laura mulvey and peter wollen it wa the publication of hayden herrera biography of kahlo in which ha led to her current cult status
since that date she ha been the subject of tv documentary a feature film frida by paul leduc a stage play numerous publication and the inspiration for designer clothing
in may elle magazine ran a page feature on frida kahlo a the spirit of mexico fig while in vogue there wa a page interpretation of the romance of frida kahlo mexico fig
almost a a logical outcome of this medium blitz it emerged in the summer of that madonna already a devotee of kahlo work wa commissioning a screenplay based on kahlo life
fig
elle magazine may
a with most artist who have become mythical personality in the popular imagination such attention ha focused primarily on the anecdotal and tragic detail of kahlo admittedly fascinating life
the passionate obsession with her husband diego rivera her flamboyant appearance but most of all her physical and emotional pain have come to dominate response to her work
while kahlo art helped her to deal with the vicissitude of her life for most audience it is her life story which allows access to her art
in this one can draw obvious parallel to the appeal of van gogh a traditionally popular artist recently made fashionable by the medium attention generated during the centennial of his death
the archetypal became an appropriate icon for the sixty revival of long hot summer
yet despite the iconic status of van gogh tragic life it is the appearance of his work by which he is ultimately signified his thick impasto his vibrant yellow the urgency of his creative drive
in the case of kahlo the popular image is of the artist herself the characteristic brow the elaborate hair the mexican costume fig
it is primarily her appearance not the formal language of her art that ha graced the page of elle and vogue magazine
the elle feature transposed the kahlo style to kahlo lookalikes in contemporary clothing balanced around segment of herrera biography of the artist
in the later vogue piece only the style remained a the far more overtly sexual kahloesque model lounged and pouted in their mexican interior
there is a poignant irony in the way clothing which on one level served to hide kahlo broken body fall or is lifted by the model to reveal a luxuriantly perfect physique fig
the visual reference in the two magazine are a much from photo of the artist a from her work
in both feature she is also seen to embody a wider set of assumption about mexico itself exotic passionate yet constantly struggling against pain and deceit
while elle vogue and subsequently the independent fig stressed different facet of kahlo public persona they all shared the emphasis on her a an encapsulisation of stereotypical image of mexico rather than her work
it is her body a the canvas her appearance a art
the art of becomes a art

vogue february

elle magazine may
of course the line between art and life is a particularly hard one to draw in kahlo case
the majority of her work is self portraiture her aesthetic concern grew from her fascination with the falsity of appearance
dressing up role playing and masquerade form the conceptual basis of kahlo work
in with cropped hair fig she paint herself wearing rivera suit challenging traditional expectation of femininity and attempting to appropriate his authority while simultaneously threatening castration
more disturbingly in the mask fig she throw doubt on too straightforward a reading of her a revealing of her inner emotion
where doe the mask fall doe not the ritual repetition of those familiar feature mask far more than it uncovers
there is however an inevitable logic to the appropriation of her meticulously constructed image a process which the artist wa mocking a early a some of the gringa woman are imitating me and trying to dress a la mexicana but the poor soul only look like cabbage and to tell you the naked truth they look absolutely impossible
the impossibility stemmed from the failure of such follower to recognise the symbolic importance of kahlo choice of clothing a failure also intrinsic to her recent magazine appearance
the particularity of mexico are frequently subsumed by the decorativeness of the ethnic by the generalised attractiveness of the radical
for kahlo however choosing to don the costume of the tehuana a for example in tree of hope fig wa to embody a powerful icon of cultural identity
mexican indian dress is extraordinarily diverse and by and large geographically specific varying from region to region
the tehuana dress is by no mean the most decorative variant or the closest to form of clothing
it is the mythology surrounding the woman wearer of the costume which directed kahlo choice
the ostensibly matriarchal society of tehuantepec led to the adoption of the tehuana in mexico a the image of the strong indian woman the undefeated counterpart to the despised chingada who conversely is the female embodiment of mexico hybrid culture
in a culture where sexual metaphor are frequently used to convey racial and political conflict the tehuana represents that aspect of mexico indigenous tradition unbowed by century of colonial and male rule
kahlo adoption of tehuana dress while being an attractive disguise of what she saw a a le than perfect body asserted both a feminist and an position

the independent on sunday april
in kahlo work there is a powerful mix of these discourse yet her role a an archetypal woman painter ha come to dominate response to her work
it is through her emergence a a cult painter of the feminist movement of the that her current reputation ha evolved
her work almost perfectly illustrates debate a to the nature of traditional exclusion of a woman art
the fascination with function of the body the analogy between artistic and physical creative process used to reveal the female body a the site of patriarchal aesthetic discourse all of these mirror the concern of many woman painter of the

in their formal language kahlo work are exemplary of certain feminist argument the adoption of the decorative the intimate and art medium reveals the restrictive nature of traditional definition of high art
this appropriateness of kahlo aesthetic to contemporary debate ha tended to remove her work from it historical context to stress the collective and the
although this is not in itself to be dismissed a a tactic it ha diminished the complexity of kahlo achievement a a specifically mexican painter operating within the particularity of her historical moment
more problematic is the way in which such a dislocation ha led to the acceptance of her mexicanness a mere decoration of the essentially feminist theme of her work thereby defusing a substantial part of the art described by breton a a ribbon round a bomb
it is the ribbon that run through the page of vogue the glossy surface of the image in direct opposition to a work such a kahlo the suicide of dorothy hale fig
in this painting a memorial to a woman tragic death is transformed into an indictment of the culture which destroyed her
hale suicide became a poignant metaphor for the oppressive nature of the social value of new york and north america in general
the story behind hale death wa one with which kahlo obviously identified and within which dress formed an important symbolic function
before jumping from the window of her apartment hale had dressed meticulously in her most flattering dress the corsage of yellow rose a gift from a male admirer
in kahlo painting the figure fall from the fantasy world she ha inhabited to the harsh bloodspattered reality of the street literally coming down to earth
hale eye stare knowingly at the viewer a human sacrifice to an alienated and consumerist culture
the horizontality of her fallen body is juxtaposed to the vertical thrust of the apartment building

although destroyed she ha also escaped
the painting dedicated to hale mother wa commissioned by a mutual friend of kahlo and dorothy hale the managing editor of vanity fair clare boothe luce
the painting wa agreed to by luce in part to recompense for what she saw a her misjudgment of her dead friend
having lent hale money to pay her rent she had been angered to discover her spending enormous sum on an dress and refused to turn up to what in retrospect became hale farewell party
later it wa revealed that the money had come from a different source
a male friend had tried to dissuade hale from seeking a much needed job and had given her a thousand dollar to buy the most beautiful dress in new york telling her that what she needed wa to find a rich husband
on one level this work deal with a generalised woman experience yet the metaphorical power of dorothy hale dress derives from kahlo use of clothing in her own
dress not only cover and decorates the body but instils in the wearer it own characteristic strength and weakness
hale black velvet dress is cursed because it represents the value of the gringolandia so hated by kahlo
in those painting where kahlo wear european dress she is passive weak and unable to control her own destiny but in the tehuana costume she is strong powerful hopeful
unclothed her body becomes yet more vulnerable but a jean franco state
the unclothed body is not a self but a socialised body a body that is opened by instrument technologized wounded it organ displayed to the outside world
the inner frida is controlled by modern society far more than the clothed frida who often mark her deviation from the norm by defiantly returning the gaze of the viewer
kahlo naked body becomes not just the tortured self of her personal biography but a visual counterpart to the injured and defiled manifestation of mexico colonised past la llorona the weeping woman of popular myth and la chingada the raped and abused mother described in paz the labyrinth of solitude
descended from an aztec mother goddess llorona is a mother figure symbolic in a wider sense of the trauma of the spanish invasion
driven mad with grief by the loss of her child she is thought to wander the street weeping and cry out a ghostly memory of the past
at it most simple la chingada a the mother of mestizo culture is the mother forcibly opened violated or deceived
the female soil possessed and misused by the masculine force of the spanish invader
the indian mexico raped and abused by the conquistador yet bearing his bastard child
the rhetoric of the tehuana opposes the nihilism of traditional feminisation of colonial trauma and asserts the potential of a dignified cultural resistance

this small painting on metal in the style of a catholic votive image show the artist poised between the technological inhumanity of a capitalist north america and the archaic fertility of mexico
interwoven with these image are subtler reference to the metaphorical borderline which separate latin american culture from that of europe and north america
this is done by a series of juxtaposition the past versus the present female nature versus masculine technology growth versus exploitation and in it very material presence the tradition of fine art versus the popular
at the same time the ambivalence of her own and modern mexico position is manifested in the figure of the artist
the paper flag of her homeland is contrasted to the modernity of the cigarette held in her other hand
the red and green of the aztec necklace link it compositionally with the indigenous plant to the south of the painting the pink dress tonally blending with the skyscraper to the north

dislocated from it political context it hang like a above the teeming street of the city decorative yet potentially explosive
there is no place there for the value the tehuana dress represents it fold are given meaning by kahlo search for a cultural identity
within the confines of the painting it becomes a silent emblem of protest a reminder of political alternative
the physicality so characteristic of kahlo work is missing no flesh no blood just the tawdriness of the peeling poster and the hollow reminder of lost liberty
the of body and dress so referred to in many of kahlo most polemical work fig ha been strangely inverted by her current popularity
her mexicanness ha become a stylistic gloss decorative colourful pretty even individualistic
the colonised body which kahlo clothed in revolutionary idealism ha lost it function a a symbol of nationhood becoming instead an icon of female suffering
what is obscured by this process is that it wa through clothing in both art and life that kahlo attempted to redress the wrong of history

jackboot beneath the serge television
by hugh hebert
there wa one point when the hair on the back of my head began to lift
not at paul hill remembrance of beating past when he could hear the sound of boot running to take part in the fun and once heard a principal medical officer no le telling colleague do walk his face do walk his face
not even the time he wa dunked head first in a tub of dubious liquid and brought up gasping for breath make him sing god save the queen they shouted
brutality a hill describes and felt it wa a bitter part of his prison life you just learnt to get down on the floor a fast a you could and cover up a best you could
but it wa gerry conlon account of being interrogated after the guildford bombing that made the scalp crawl
we know your mother work at the royal victoria hospital they told him we know where your sister work and there are sectarian killing down there
they told me they could arrange an accident
and i believed they were capable of murdering my mother i honestly believe they would have murdered my mother that why i signed the statement
the account he gave just after his release wa that the threat had been that a british soldier might accidentally shoot one of the woman
a few month ago even this would have seemed improbable
you might have assumed this wa the police bluffing and bullying
yet given what we have learned about link between the security service and the loyalist paramilitary in northern ireland and the deep suspicion about surrogate murder you ca shrug off the shiver conlon word bring
there were daunting moment in last night first tuesday yorkshire but few of them matched that hint of a jackboot under the blue serge
it right that the guildford four have told their story now to grant mckee and ro franey and first tuesday the programme and the producer who dug away and did much to keep the case alive
and they told it without questioning though the programme is skilfully structured to give it a coherence it might have lacked
carole richardson is the most haunting face
you have to hope that it blankness will slowly dissolve and let life in
just once a couple of tear rolled down
it wa when she described seeing film of the result of the bombing on television and thinking they think i did that
armstrong seems the least permanently damaged on the surface
he pay tribute to his treatment at gartree prison he apologises to the bomb victim family that they have had to keep reminding them of their loss but we had to fight for our freedom
hill express the way time ha cheated them his daughter wa born while he wa remanded in custody and is now she would change dramatically and i did feel a change in myself mentally
i still in my head
nothing happened to me
i have lived
but again it wa conlon the slightly irish poet of the quartet articulate flamboyant remember that extraordinary exit through the front door of the old bailey who cut deep into the collective conscience
he described being taken over the year to see his sick and finally dying and almost certainly innocent father in another prison
he wa convicted with the maguires in the parallel case of a bomb factory
and he tell how none of the assembled guard and official could look his father in the eye a he protested his innocence
only the nurse could do that
and at the end conlon drew the one hopeful conclusion if this stop capital punishment ever coming back the time i spent in prison will be well worth it
if this stop another innocent person going to prison it be well worth it
i had numerous prison governor say to me yes conlon we know you innocent but there nothing we can do about it
we get a custody order and that it
what sort of system of justice is that
it wa the only programme last night to shine light into dirty corner
inside the brotherhood granada produced by claudia milne and martin short dug into the most notorious area of masonic influence local government
in southend where of the adult male are reckoned to be mason it went into the case of what you might call preferential allocation of council property and the battle of one councillor christopher hudson to break the grip of the men on the square we ca have a secret society operating within the framework of a democracy he said
it a paradox it a nonsense
though over the year from southend to tyneside and the government own property service agency there all too much evidence that this is exactly what we do have
law report
parliament urged to think again on housing issue
queen bench divisional court sandwell metropolitan borough council v bujok before lord justice watkins and mr justice hutchison november
if a dwelling house is in such a state of disrepair a to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance the tenant may lay an information against his landlord alleging the existence of a statutory nuisance under the public health act
the tenant is not obliged to ensure that the landlord is aware of the defect in the premise or to give the landlord an opportunity to remedy the defect before commencing legal proceeding
although that is the position in law the court emphasised that a a matter of commonsense a tenant should first complain to the landlord before exercising the right to prosecute
the fact
mr bujok and her family occupied a house a council tenant
in september mr bujok laid an information against the council alleging the existence and continuance of a statutory nuisance under section of the public health act
it wa alleged that the council being the owner of the premise were the person by whose act default or sufferance the nuisance arose
prior to laying the information mr bujok had not served an abatement notice upon the council or informed them of the alleged defect in the premise
the justice held mr bujok wa not required to ensure that the council were aware of the defective state of the property prior to laying the information
the council appealed by case stated
the legislation
section of the act defines statutory nuisance a any premise in such a state a to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance
the decision
mr justice hutchison said the act primarily envisages a system where the local authority ha a power and a duty to try to secure that premise are not in a state which constitutes a statutory nuisance
action is initiated by the service of an abatement notice requiring remedial work
if the person in default fails to comply with an abatement notice the local authority is obliged to make a complaint to the magistrate
if the complaint is proved a nuisance order is made requiring the defendant to get the necessary work done
effectively the sequence is that the person in default is told what is wrong and is required to put it right
he is given an opportunity to do so and if he doe not he is subject to sanction by the court to compel him to do so
the problem arises in connection with section which adapts or applies the provision to case where an individual rather than the local authority wish to make the complaint
need he serve an abatement notice
the authority plainly establish that he need not and can not do so
doe that mean he may lay an information and bring the matter before the magistrate without first putting the person alleged to be in default on notice of what is alleged
the council argued that a landlord particularly one such a a local authority can not realistically be expected to have a system of inspection of all it premise and in practice is entitled to depend upon notification by it tenant
for mr bujok it wa argued that the act wa designed to secure in the interest of the community at large that statutory nuisance did not exist
it wa submitted that an owner can not turn his back on his property because when he purchase and take on the responsibility of letting he know the property will in the course of time deteriorate
he must therefore satisfy himself on a regular basis that it doe not constitute a statutory nuisance
in warner v lambeth london borough council hlr lord justice glidewell said a private person could lay an information alleging the failure to abate a statutory nuisance without first giving notice requiring abatement
therefore in the present case the justice came to the correct conclusion
his lordship reached that decision without enthusiasm because it seemed that a a matter of common sense notice should be given in such circumstance before criminal proceeding were launched
lord justice watkins said he agreed with reluctance
it wa surely repugnant to commonsense that in this area of legal activity a local authority should be prosecuted by one of it tenant without first being given the opportunity by that tenant to remedy the consequence of a neglect to repair the dwelling that the tenant occupied
in law there wa no doubt that mr bujok wa entitled to commence proceeding without giving notice of the state of the dwelling to the council
but in every other conceivable way that action wa entirely wrong
endless trouble to many people in court and council office and much money could be saved by the giving of notice of disrepair
if the council did not react to that notice then would be the time for the tenant to exercise the right to prosecute
parliament should give fresh thought to enacting a provision placing an obligation upon a council tenant to give notice to the council before being permitted to commence proceeding

leinster face an uphill task
by robert armstrong in dublin
the all black begin the irish leg of their tour at lansdowne road today against leinster who have never beaten a major touring side
leinster have named a team that look strong on paper including eight international yet they recently lost to both munster and ulster in the championship
such is the mood of pessimism here it is hard to find anyone who belief the all black having won their seven match in wale will face any significant threat during the next fortnight
ulster the provincial champion may well fancy their chance on november but leinster look certain to face an uphill struggle even though the tourist have rested of the team that beat wale
leinster will be hard pushed to keep the score within the respectable margin of defeat set by their predecessor
in the all black defeated leinster they won in and scraped home in
however during the eighty irish provincial rugby ha assumed a third world status in relation to new zealand
leinster have been undermined by their failure to secure prestige fixture since the
when new zealand last toured ireland in leinster were ignored
the same thing happened in when the province wa denied a fixture against the wallaby
such neglect ha done nothing for their confidence
even so the all black who include seven capped player will give today opponent due respect
a their coach alex wyllie remarked when we arrived in wale we were told cardiff were no damned good and look how well they played against u
leinster are quite capable of doing the same
wyllie is confident his western samoan wing tuigamala will play although he is still niggled by an ankle injury received against neath two week ago
the test flanker alan whetton whose hamstring injury kept him out against wale will form a powerful back row with kevin schuler and the international zinzan brooke
the tourist will field four back aged or under
for their part leinster are boosted by the presence of four player already selected for ireland to play new zealand in dublin on november
they are brendan mullin the lion centre fergus aherne the and the two new cap nick popplewell at and brian smith the
no doubt smith the oxford university australian who won five cap for the wallaby will feel a bit closer to home facing the all black twice in the next day
it will be fascinating to see how smith a gifted footballer shape up in his prospective international partnership with aherne
equally intriguing will be the performance of the young london irish lock neil francis who ha been left out of the current ireland squad
fortunately leinster front five which includes the experienced prop de fitzgerald look upto the task of scrummaging against the all black
however real problem may arise once leinster attempt to win the loose ball
leinster will be led by their third captain in a many match the centre paul clinch
leinster f dunlea j sexton p clinch capt b mullin p purcell b smith f aherne n popplewell n kearney d fitzgerald n francis b rigney p kenny k leahy a blair

figure of fun open space
i write in response to judith raymont november who wrote of the cartoon men a user guide it is either insulting to men and should not be endorsed by publication or it is witty and amusing in which case we a woman have no right to complain about equivalent portrayal of female stereotype
it doe not matter if the cartoon is insulting to men
the number of such cartoon is so small that set against the insult to woman broadcast by every newsagent and television channel only a loony masculist would object to them
before raymont work towards way of showing respect understanding and affection to member of the opposite sex she should realise that the opposite sex obsession with member is a problem of enormous gravity
there is nothing respectful understanding or affectionate about page three
w j gaskill male east kilbride
iwould agree that male and female stereotype portrayed in cartoon are equally abhorrent were it not for the fact that whilst one poke fun at a powerful group in society men the other perpetuates the oppression of a powerless group woman
in an ideal world there would be no need for either but for now i would rather see the frustration expressed in these term than in the sort of bitterness that ha given feminism such a bad name
natalie ford brighton
men a user guide is stupid negative and insulting
am i a a man supposed to think that if my body is hairy it is thick and bestial
or that my mind which i consider intelligent and creative is occupied only with sex violence and car engine
is this funny
what kind of hypocrisy allows you to presumably condemn a similarly degrading portrayal of woman whilst making your page a forum for this cartoon

soccer littlewoods cup fourth round oldham athletic arsenal double by ritchie end wait
by stephen bierley
oldham athletic who had never beaten a first division side since they dropped into the second division in made up for year of not altogether patient waiting with a pulsating victory over the league champion arsenal at boundary park last night
the pennines fairly shook
no supporter of the latics dared dream it but suddenly the improbable wa a throbbing joyous reality
two goal from the irrepressible andy ritchie his and this season and a third by the midfield player nick henry and arsenal were sunk with only the trace of a goal by quinn
despite many and varied flurry of activity in the first minute arsenal seemed reasonably secure if not inspired
they held their line and competed hard in midfield damping down oldham initial verve and preparing themselves for more of the same in the second half
then oldham struck
winterburn almost put the ball into his own net from milligan cross recovering an awkward situation
almost immediately smith had an excellent chance for arsenal but stumbled
oldham took up the attack again and barlow who had a fine match at totally containing rocastle floated in a deep cross beyond winterburn
the predatory ritchie chested the ball down and hammered a volley past lukic
arsenal had no choice but to attack a soon a the second half began
a neat by rocastle sent thomas hurtling in on goal but rhodes moved sharply off his line to smother the shot
from the resulting corner rhodes made another fine save hurtling to his right to deflect away dixon rising shot
finally with arsenal pressing hard he clawed away quinn careful header from thomas
quinn held his head in disbelief
worse far worse wa to follow
bunn who scored six goal in the previous round against scarborough this time turned into the provider putting milligan clear and free
he wa hauled back on the edge of the area by a professional foul for which the arsenal central defender wa booked
holden clattered the wall and the ball fell to henry who drilled a low shot from more than yard inside lukic post
in another minute any remaining oldham doubt were dispelled
ritchie passed to irwin and then ran on to head the cross past lukic
arsenal were stitched and stuffed with no question of a fluke
not for the first time this season their defence had been found wanting and oldham exploited the weakness to the full owing a special debt to the inspiration and tireless running of henry and milligan
george graham wa not amused
he called his team performance unacceptable
but he also said let not take any credit away from oldham
they were tremendous and outplayed u in the first half
the plastic pitch is no excuse
we trained on an artificial pitch for two day this week and we should have done a lot better
joe royle the oldham manager wa full of praise both for graham and his own team
george wa brilliant he said
he could have blamed this and that but he said we deserved it
the manager attitude show why they are champion
he took it on the chin
one or two people will be ready to put this down to plastic but our goal were nothing to do with plastic
this wa a great performanc
we rattled them from the first minute and did give them any breathing space
we were for minute and we scored three great goal
in the past we have had cup walk not run

prototyping is crucial to system development argues ian richards tailored to fit
in system development nothing is more fundamental than assessing user requirement
if you do know what the system is required to do you do know anything
but many system developer are unable to ass requirement properly
they seem to think that you can ask a businessman what his requirement are and get an answer that amount to a draft system specification
a doctor doe ask his patient what treatment to prescribe
the patient can explain only what the problem is
it is the doctor that provides the remedy
if you ask a user what sort of system he want you will be met with a blank look
a user may have a deep knowledge of business problem but knowing little about computer ha no idea how they should be tackled
yet analyst are heard asking time and again tell me what you want
we gone awayfrom the day of system imposed by the data processing department this is going to be a system for the user
but of course the user do know what they want so they end up getting another duff system
an effective analyst provides the same service to the business a the doctor provides to the patient
he find out what the need of the business are and prescribes the cure
the user tell the analyst what the problem are and the analyst decides at least in broad term what the user requires
but the analyst ha one great advantage over the doctor
once the user becomes familiar with the proposed system helpful comment come thick and fast
oh this will be of great help in ordering raw material but sometimes we get part delivery could we have an extra facility to deal with those
and sometimes discount is given a pig to deal with on the old system but if you could add one extra input box on that screen there
and what about order not delivered on time
if we could list those we have advance warning of shortage problem on the assembly line two month before they occur
now that would be a great leap forward
unfortunately you can not reach this stage until you have developed a prototype system
and you ca develop a prototype system because the user have got a clue what they want
most of them are probably muttering i too busy to get involved in this sort of thing
what wrong with the old system anyway
the only way to develop a prototype is for the analyst to get inside the head of the user and thinking like a user decide what sort of system is required
of course the initial system will not be perfect
the analyst can not hope to understand the business a well in a few week a the user doe after many year
but once the user see the system channel of communication will open
instead of persuading the user to specify requirement the analyst will be driven by the user to meet key need
good system development go through two distinct phase
initially the analyst doe all the work leading the user towards a system he think is right for the business
but once the user see the potential of the system a change in attitude take place
the process becomes demand driven by the user
the analyst is then forced on the defensive explaining why new feature can not be included because they are technically difficult or prohibitively expensive
traditionally system were validated by user agreeing functional specification
in theory validation meant that the user had read the specification imagined how the system would work in practice and agreed the design
it wa only when using a test version of the system available just before the planned implementation date that difficulty would come to light and a host of change request be issued
the advent of fourth generation language ha made system development much easier
with a an initial prototype can be put together quickly
this mean feedback is obtained early in the development process and the system can grow around the user requirement
crucial to the development process is the relationship built up between the analyst and the user
the best system arise when both have a deep understanding of each other job
many developer use business analyst to ensure that the development team maintain a proper focus on business requirement
but this can be a it cut off communication between the system analyst and the user
too much specialisation is bad for system development it feed the temptation to get engrossed in technical difficulty and forget about the underlying business need
if you should stroll into a pub and meet an analyst and a user talking about work and you can not tell one from the other they have probably developed a successful system together

edoardo amaldi
ragazzi of distinction
in december the men working feverishly to create the first american atomic bomb sent a team of spook to naples
one of their main assignment wa to contact edoardo amaldi a physicist thought to be in hiding near rome
six month later the day before rome liberation by the ally amaldi wa found
he wa interviewed by moe berg then one of the most famous baseball player in america
berg wa also an agent of the office of strategic service which wa later to give birth to the cia
his job wa to convince amaldi to pack his bag because there wa a ship waiting at naples to take him to the united state
amaldi presence there had been sought by two other italian colleague also physicist
his mentor enrico fermi later to be called the father of the bomb and emilio segre who died in california earlier this year
amaldi dodged the american invitation perhaps because with rome liberated fermi mantle in physic had fallen on his young shoulder and there were younger mind to teach
he wore that mantle well at rome university until his retirement in
but amaldi never really retired nor grew old
he kept regular hour in the university physic building spoke at scientific meeting this year in moscow and washington
a president of the accademia nazionale dei lincei he had delivered the welcoming address on tuesday to a symposium of scientist
he then ordered a car to call for him the next morning for a similar occasion and wa felled by a stroke while waiting for the lift
amaldi grew up in a small town in lombardy and took his doctorate in physic from rome at the remarkably early age of
in he became one of the ragazzi di via panisperna the street where fermi kid carried out their own experiment under the master in their own lab
emilio segre wa one kid and bruno pontecorvo later to defect from britain to the soviet union another
it is interesting to note that the pope a the kid called fermi because he always right wa only seven year older than amaldi
amaldi astounded his group in october with his discovery that by slowing down rather than accelerating neutron he could provoke intense nuclear reaction
he held a chair in physic from until his retirement publishing more than paper on atomic and nuclear physic
he wa awarded honorary degree by algiers glasgow and oxford
he became a founder and active executive of the european centre for nuclear research in geneva
i had the pleasure of two long talk last year with professor amaldi about his knowledge of what the german physicist were doing with their atom during the war year
apart for his incongruously white hair amaldi seemed to have the mental lucidity and expected energy of a man half his age
his modesty considering his fame in his field wa endearing
i knew almost nothing about physic but we shared some joke about the rome telephone system
in amaldi wrote to the italian prime minister asking for permission to produce and sell sealing wax for letter so that we may raise needed fund for our physic lab
the reply came from an who said that the present funding wa considered adequate and the commercial undertaking would be

the intifada is a people unarmed revolution against occupation
it two main slogan repeated countless time in the directive issued by the underground leadership are freedom and independence
it ha employed a dual strategy to achieve these two objective
first a comprehensive civil disobedience campaign wa begun by which people severed or minimised all the contact point by which they were bound to the israeli occupation authority
this campaign included resignation of palestinian official from public post the boycott of israeli good and product and the refusal to pay tax and fine
partial and full strike demonstration convention all these have in fact only constituted the outer layer of an inner mechanism of civilian rebellion
the second and complementary part of the intifada strategy concentrated on the construction of an indigenous national authority
a israel authority wa being lifted the population began creating an alternative authority of their own
popular committee were established in village refugee camp suburb street in fact in every community
some headway wa made in expanding whether through utilising more land for agriculture developing home economy or encouraging local manufacturer and product
village and refugee camp were thus being developed into liberated or independent area if not militarily then at least psychologically politically and infrastructurally
bloody clash would occur whenever armoured unit raided these village storming through makeshift defensive road block and responding to rock being thrown with live bullet and tear gas but no sooner would these army unit be gone than authority would revert to the village resident
palestinian flag would be raised on minaret and church spire road block would again be erected and life in all it aspect would once again be run by the local leadership
the structure of the developing national authority ha been both diffuse enough to prevent it from being destroyed by any one single sweep of arrest there have been more than arrest since the intifada outbreak and coherent enough to allow for the existence of a unified resistance strategy
while the entire network of popular committee local institution and the general public constitute the field commander in the battle of civilian disobedience and of constructing a political infrastructure a rotating unified national command act in the role of issuing a directive outlining policy and determining specific resistance programme
a high level of mobility in the structure allows for continuous interchange of role and idea and retains for the unified national command the closeness to grass root that is required to make it truly reflect people wish and sentiment
this expanded network of popular committee and institution making up the unified leadership is infused by ten of thousand of activist who belong to or identify with the different faction of the plo
in effect therefore the plo exists at all level of organisation within the occupied territory
thus the palestinian national movement both inside and outside the occupied territory is an organic whole
the pattern of the intifada ha been cyclical
thrust of resistance mass demonstration resignation tax rebellion etc would come in crest
the pattern is determined by a wide variety of factor including what the israeli army doe
but the relation is complex not
harsh measure putting an entire community under an absolute curfew for a continuous lengthy period of time demolishing home uprooting olive or citrus tree physical intimidation and terror tactic employed by raiding army unit shooting killing cutting off water or electricity supply and telephone link to village or town mass arrest intimidatory interrogation technique can either create a temporary lull or activate an eruption
the army never know which it will be
it is a if it is walking through a minefield
the pattern of the intifada it pain and suffering are all reminiscent of the process of birth
the metaphor is apt a palestinian regard themselves a engaging in a process of giving birth to their independent palestinian state
through their revolution the mass are both mother and midwife to the birth of this state
the intifada is the midwife of freedom
through it palestinian are struggling on a daily basis to shake off israel authority and to construct their own
the struggle reflects a revolution in mass consciousness by which people have come to realise that idea and aspiration must be embodied in manifest act if reality is to be changed
thus wherever one look one find people engaged in the construction of the block that will make up the palestinian state
it is a conscious effort
the mass are being engaged in the craft of
in this process of state building many stage have been covered
the declaration of independence issued by the palestine national council pnc on november last year constitutes a major landmark along this road
it significance lie in it double message that the aim of the palestinian struggle is the establishment of palestinian independence and that this independence is regarded a being not at israel expense
this ha been a constant theme of intifada policy that we wish to build palestine not to destroy israel that we wish to achieve freedom for our people not to deprive others israeli of it that we wish to protect and save life ours not to endanger the life of others israeli
in one of several intifada leaflet written in hebrew and addressed to the israeli soldier on duty in the occupied territory the message wa repeated soldier go home
return to your family and child
be with them in peace so that we may remain with our family and child in peace
we do not wish to harm you or your state
we wish to be unharmed in our own state
how can the process of state building be developed
if the pnc declaration of independence constituted a major landmark in this process the time ha come to embark on another major step that of declaring the setting up of a state or government structure
an escalation of the intifada in this direction would serve two purpose at once
first it would consolidate the structure of the developing national authority which is competing to replace the occupation authority
second it would consolidate the image and essence of the intifada a a constructive not a destructive force
naturally to embark on such a step is not necessarily to succeed immediately in realising it
rather it is a challenge
it will be a further challenge to israel occupation conceived in the image of earlier challenge of the intifada
but it will also be a challenge to u palestinian summoning u to work more energetically towards the idea fulfilment
it would be a natural extension of the intifada dual strategy towards disengagement from israel and the corresponding process of state building
it would further naturalise and legitimise the evolving skeletal form of palestinian independence
it would provide the multitudinous popular committee and activity with a more advanced form of organisation and structure
it would enable better planning and performance
it would maximise civilian tactic of resistance and defuse the natural potential for violence containing and eventually eliminating the marginal but intrusive phenomenon of collaborator activation by israeli security authority and collaborator execution by local palestinian
it would create a further fact that would put israel on the spot
israel reaction however hostile could only further our cause
arresting or deporting the ten of thousand of palestinian professional who would be employed in perfectly apolitical harmless and humanitarian job can only further isolate the israeli government
measure can only imply success
a modus vivendi would also imply success
in general our policy should be to proceed with building our state block by block without waiting to be given a gift of it through negotiation
we should regard negotiation rather a the mean by which we could establish formal agreement between our state and israel
such agreement can range from the issue of border to the issue of free for our future television and radio network
in the meantime we have the capacity to bring coherence and organisation to a whole range of activity further consolidating the institutional linkage between the people in the occupied state and the plo leadership
entire department can be set up in health foreign affair agriculture trade finance education justice religion information and social welfare
a pyramid administrative structure establishing link from popular committee in village right up to the executive committee of the plo in it capacity a a cabinet can be established
during the intifada the people have been engaged in building the side wall
a government would provide the roof which would bring these wall together
it would add another necessary touch in the process of creating a palestinian home

the boy and the dog skirted round opposite side of the puddle the boy a light tall labouring in wellington boot too large for him and the dog a labrador bitch picking her way reluctantly with frequent pause a if her paw hurt
the boy unlike the dog knew that the mud did not go on for ever beyond the bridge the disused railway embankment along which they were walking became built up so that water ran off it
he pulled the dog close to him to let a mixed string of horse and pony go past waving shyly to the lead rider a pretty capable girl an unbridgeable two year older than him
he watched her a she went past at a walk the black labrador and he both gazing wistfully their breath steaming in the cold february morning
he waited till the horse were well away and looked round the wide flat landscape carefully before unclipping the lead
way you go patty he said softly and the dog wa off hurling herself along the embankment all paw and flying ear after a rabbit who had been sitting in a patch of sun but disappeared with contemptuous ease a she came close
the boy had been told unequivocally not to let her off the lead the only used the land by grace of it owner and it wa a shooting estate but he hated keeping the dog straining at the lead and knew that she would always come to his call
he stood for a moment laughing at her a she cast furiously for the vanished rabbit and walked on to catch her up along the raised embankment
the tree had grown up beside it in the year since the railway had closed and the boy stopped every now and then to watch small bird hopping around the top branch
he particularly liked this stretch nothing but the odd tractor and the horse ever came down this embankment and the bird were unworried by his presence
after half a mile he decided to turn off the embankment and walk up the side of the next field and along the path at the top of it following the horse whom he could still see in the distance
he called patty to him
she did come which wa surprising she wa a docile creature and particularly devoted to him because he always took her for a walk when he wa at the stable
he could hear her barking and looked down over the steep side of the embankment to the bottom of the tree
he called her again and again but she would not stop barking at something he could not see
probably a squirrel he decided and slithered down the side of the embankment to join her scolding a he went
straightening up beside the dog he looked where she wa looking and blinked
he saw a leg uncomfortably wedged between sapling tree swollen grotesquely and gazed at it stupidly wondering if it wa plastic
a his eye focused he realized he wa looking at a hideously swollen human body and just then a the light breeze shifted he caught the odour of decay
he wa a sensible and capable boy an eldest child so he moved closer trying not to breathe and stood steadfastly looking until he wa confident of what he had seen a body must be a girl because it wa wearing a skirt lying face down head towards the bottom of the embankment a if she had dived off the top
he clipped the lead on to the dog with cold hand which would hardly function and let her pull him up the slope a fast a he could make his leg move
he stopped on the embankment shaking with cold and shock to note the spot then fled along the tractor path the dog running with him to the stable where the ten child ride wa in it closing stage
miss williams
jamie i teaching
the thin capable woman who wa taking the looked at him in amazement a he leaned panting on the gate to the ring the dog whining beside him
i sorry
please i found something i must tell you
she had known him since he wa a very small perched like a mosquito on one of the placid beginner pony so she told the class to carry on walking their pony while she came to him
there someone dead
below the railway embankment
are you sure
the boy looked at her and uncontrollable tear suddenly filled his eye
he wa very nearly a tall a her but she put an arm under his shoulder and supported him to the untidy room which served a the stable office calling to one of the stable girl to take over the class
patty found her
she just lying there but she is dead
he scrubbed at his face with the handkerchief she offered and gulped for air
i ring the police
she did so casting an experienced eye over him
sit down here jamie and i make some tea
mummy will come back in a few minute wo she for susie
not mummy
aunt margaret is coming at ten
the boy thought longingly of his mother but managed to help miss williams describe the location of the body to a startled local station sergeant and to drink a cup of sweet milky tea without being sick
by the time his aunt arrived jamie wa so far recovered a to be able to refuse to go home and to point out severely that he would be needed either to assist the police or to be lead rider in the class or possibly both
he watched his aunt and miss williams wordlessly consult each other but knew his aunt would do a she wa told successful solicitor though she wa she wa ten year younger than miss williams and a she complained totally intimidated by her a she had not been by anyone since her late headmistress
he wa unsurprised to find her packed off firmly to take his sister home leaving him a a person of major importance in what he instantly assumed to be a real murder
miss williams took him to meet the police land rover at the stable gate a wiry woman in her late fifty her expression sufficiently forbidding to prevent the parent edging car through the gate to collect child from the ten ride from asking any question
jamie through a renewed queasiness just observed that the police driver wa instantly reduced to half his age by miss williams greeting
he wa one of my boy she said in explanation to the cid sergeant who wa leading the party a they bumped over the rough road through the thick mud and on to the dry embankment
like jamie here
did you recognize the person you found young man the sergeant asked carefully
no
tear started into jamie eye
she wa all swollen
the sergeant eye widened and he slid out of the land rover and stood back to let jamie out
very competent boy
almost a professional singer handle himself very well
miss williams natural pitch well suited to reaching across a wa discreetly reduced
the cid sergeant thanked her gravely and went to stand beside jamie who wa peering down the embankment looking pinched
we go down together lad
there is room
i lead
he took a deep breath and headed down the sergeant two constable and miss williams in his wake
soon they all stood side by side one of the younger policeman coughing involuntarily
oh dear oh dear miss williams said on an indrawn breath
sorry
come along jamie let get you back
she took out a handkerchief and mopped her eye
the police driver shot jamie a look of enquiry which he missed occupied a he wa with guiding miss williams back up the hill
he had seen her weep before but only for a sick horse and he wa
jamie did you let patty off the lead
the boy blushed to his ear and owned to it
you must not do it jamie we be in trouble with colonel james i told all you boy a thousand time
he perhaps not do it again the sergeant murmured and received the look that miss williams habitually bent on a child who wa riding carelessly
how long had she been there
jamie asked anxiously
a few day the sergeant said grimly
how many
doctor tell u
he considered the boy thoughtfully and decided to take him back quickly
these teenager were in his experience a lot le tough than they looked
any idea who it could be he asked miss williams casually
no
but only a local would know to put a body there
if jamie had let the dog off the lead she could have been there much longer
the sergeant nodded deciding it could do no harm to concede a point he had already taken
no one could tell who she wa surely
miss williams said quietly to him sounding shaky
she did even look human
the sergeant confirmed that that happened with body after a few day
we identify her though he said reassuringly
somebody will likely have reported her missing
he stopped abruptly a he remembered a conversation earlier that week and lit a cigarette thinking furiously
this could be the girl whom the yard were looking for and he had better do everything very quickly indeed including finding his chief who would then want to find his chief constable and notify scotland yard
presumably it would be the yard who investigated this one rather than the regional crime squad
he chewed his thumbnail a he walked out of long experience keeping in mind the highest priority ensure body not moved and ensure next of kin notified before the press got the story
he posted the detective constable he had with him back down the path to join his colleague armed with instruction to repel all attempt by anyone however senior or armed with whatever authority to go anywhere near the body unless he sergeant black personally accompanied them
then he climbed into the land rover beside his two passenger and drove off fast with the aim of abandoning jamie to the custody of his aunt a quickly a possible
he could see with half an eye that the kid aunt wa going to be one of the confident bossy woman with whom that part of cambridgeshire wa substantially
john mcleish wa in his office saturday or no saturday telling himself he needed to catch up on the paperwork
the phone rang and he picked it up frowning
one of the pleasure of saturday working wa that the phone did not ring all the time
the voice at the other end wa plainly and it took him a minute to disentangle what he wa being told
oh congratulation charlie
sorry what did you say it wa again
a little girl
actually a very big girl a these thing go nine pound
it fantastic john there she is a new person lying on her face sound asleep
i just left them and i going back
mcleish repressed the malicious thought that this event might put francesca nose just a little bit out of joint
she had been utterly secure in her position a the only girl in the wilson family and now there wa another one
i got another bit of good news
frannie going to be able to bring tristram home pretty soon apparently
mcleish expressed qualified enthusiasm and charlie assured him he felt exactly the same about his younger brother
the difficulty is that perry doe everything that bit better than tristram
not that this is any excuse john i do know
he paused reminding mcleish irresistibly of a labrador wondering how best to approach an acquaintance
i wanted to say you see that i know you thought frannie should have gone and that it ruined your holiday plan and on behalf of u all i sorry
i know the little boy lean on her too much and i would have gone if i could
he coughed embarrassed and a little pompous very much conscious of his new status a a father while mcleish remembered that he wa a scant four year older than the delinquent tristram
anyway she should be back soon charlie concluded
mcleish thanked him gravely feeling a he often did with the wilson that he wa being enveloped in a large feather eiderdown and made restless by the call went down the corridor to where he knew catherine crane wa also in getting her office in order
he stopped at the door and smiled at her
wearing jean and a blue shirt she wa tugging at a filing cabinet which wa too large for her to embrace and which wa threatening to on her
she looked about sixteen and beautiful
she let go of the cabinet coughing in the dust of age that appeared to be lurking behind it and smiled back at him a the february sun shone through the small window behind her throwing into sharp relief the patch on the wall where her predecessor had hung poster and the ingrained dirt on the flaking paintwork round the mean narrow metal window
where do you want that put
mcleish advanced on the cabinet and shifted it authoritatively ignoring the clip on the ankle dealt him by an unsecured bottom drawer apparently full of brick
i should have unloaded it first catherine crane said apologetically but i just could move in any direction with it where it wa
i here just tell me if you want anything else shifted
he hesitated
i going to do another hour then have some lunch if you want to come
he wa aware that he wa not managing to sound exactly like a senior officer making a recent arrival feel at home but decided not to add any further rider to his invitation
that would be very nice
are we going to the canteen
not if i can help it
what about the pub
if i allowed to buy my own
mcleish considered
that fine on the food i buy the drink i too old to get used to woman buying my drink
she laughed at him and said gravely that she would be happy to indulge him and he went away grinning
peter yeo wa also in his office having told his wife he wa lunching with a client
it wa he felt just too difficult to be at home at all with claudia in a permanently bitchy mood and both his teenage child taking their cue from her and behaving intolerably
he wandered restlessly about and decided that the lie might a well become the truth
without angela morgan at least two major client were in danger of not getting the assiduous service they were paying for and it would be well worth trying to see if one of them whom he knew to be a fellow refugee from family life at the weekend could be found
he wa in luck and fixed to meet andy barton at brazzo where yeo davis had a table permanently booked
he had to admit that this particular client hardly added to the general decorative smartness of the place
andy barton founder and chief executive of barton textile wa almost a broad a he wa long virtually neckless with incongruously long brown hair curling over his collar
his enormous hand dwarfed the elegant menu which he wa studying in apparent disbelief and peter yeo noticed again a barton without rising extended one massive paw that though the finger were an ordinary length it wa the width of the palm that made the hand so large
i never see how they get the sale per square foot in these place barton observed without further greeting
i mean they not open twelve hour like my shop and they are using the space
his small bright blue eye swept disparagingly over the minimalized black and white flooring stainless steel chair and black wooden bar
they make a huge margin on a smaller turnover andy out of punter like u
peter yeo wa amused by and respectful of a man with an obsession
angela not working today
barton worked a day which began with careful detailed consideration of the trading figure and key ratio for every one of his major shop and the output of both factory and continued usually by helicopter with a detailed aerial survey of a particular area a the quick way of identifying new site interspersed with unheralded descent on the manager of any shop he took a fancy to visit
peter yeo who had known this particular juggernaut since he had his first small factory and two store and dirt under his fingernail from shifting personally wa not fazed by the question
angela taking a few day off she ha been well he said easily
i know she been working very hard for you
i up to speed with huerter of course but is your planning application in leicester all right
barton assured him warmly that angela had done a great job and he wa now confident of getting planning permission on the vast site he had wanted
peter yeo who knew him in this mood decided to prod gently
angela said the council wanted it for housing
yeah some of them did
silly bugger it job they want there first
plenty of housing if those stupid fart at the council got round to repairing it and stopped their tenant tearing apart what they have got
my mum brought up five of u in a flat far worse than what these immigrant complain about
peter yeo who had personally persuaded barton of the presentational disadvantage of using word like darky nigger or wog decided that immigrant even though used in the manner of one invoking a curse wa a good a he wa going to get with this particular client
she doing a good job on sorting this huerter thing too
bloody ridiculous them bloke at the dti pushing assistance for huerter
i voted for this government because they said they were going to go in for that sort of rubbish
no one ever gave me anything and my business work
still angie can fix the treasury on this one given her boyfriend ca she
that the reason i wanted you on this
peter yeo winced inwardly but he wa not going to tell andy barton that angela wa missing or express any of his reservation about how much influence angela could bring to bear
he smoothly changed the subject to the look of the blond model three table away and barton agreed he would mind a bit of that on the thin side mind you but tasty
the rest of lunch passed in similar diversion interspersed with detail of last week turnover which were never far from barton mind whatever other distraction offered
mr huntley wa having lunch with her daughter
she ate placidly acknowledging to herself with her customary good sense that at the moment a at any time since her brother william had died she and penelope were getting no pleasure at all from each other company
penelope wa looking particularly discontented and disaffected picking at her food
her red suit wa smart but too bright a colour for her pale english pink and white skin her brown hair could have done with a wash and her nail were ragged and bitten
she wa frowning deep line appearing between her eyebrow mouth drawn down at the edge so that instead of a classically slim english rose in her late twenty she looked faded year older than her real age and shrewish
mr huntley sighed her brother whom she had loved but knew to be to a fault had done his niece real harm by leaving so much of his money away from the girl who had confidently believed herself to be his favourite thing on earth
penelope however it had to be acknowledged had made no attempt to rise above the blow she had been dealt by finding a dazzling girl of her own age favoured over herself in her uncle will
at least mr huntley thought hopefully she had stopped wondering unbecomingly and stridently how her uncle could have been fooled by angela morgan
it wa grizel huntley own view that her brother had not been fooled at all but had been charmed and diverted by a dashing girl thirty year his junior and had seen no reason at all why she should not have a share of his considerable estate when that left a very decent for his niece a well
indeed she had respected angela morgan for the straightforwardness with which she had tackled the issue when they had met at the lawyer office
i sorry you disappointed she had said to penelope but after all there a lot of money quite enough for both of u
so there wa grizel huntley acknowledged and it would be a great deal better if penny could manage to think a bit more positively
if she ha vanished i going to see that solicitor about whether i can get her presumed dead
penny sounding childishly sullenly determined broke into her mother thought
grizel huntley looked across at her shocked
i would wait a little if i were you
penelope glared at her turning an ungraceful scarlet but mr huntley held her ground
you are being silly about this penny
you are letting this disappointment and that all it is you still a very young woman get in the way of everything
penelope choked on her pudding and started to cry angry uncontrollable tear
grizel huntley reached out to comfort her but she forced back her chair and fled clutching her handbag and napkin leaving her mother with the ruin of lunch
fifty mile north sarah morgan had just finished serving a lunch that no one had done more than pick at
her husband francis had made a slightly better showing than her daughter jennifer who wa looking particularly ragged
mother and daughter were very like each other tall dark slim woman with curly hair and slightly snub nose
francis morgan by contrast wa dark almost with bright brown eye
of medium height and packed with energy even distressed a he wa he wa bursting round the kitchen hair still damp at the back from his swim
let go to the flick
no point at all sitting round looking at each other
come on jennifer or are you going out with michael
he gone back to australia dad
last week
jennifer sounded defeated and he looked at her sideways with familiar love and exasperation
she just did seem to be able to hang on to men he thought impatiently not like his angie wherever she wa
giles rang up his daughter volunteered and he wa uncomfortably reminded by something in her voice that giles hawick wa one of the men jennifer had been able to hang on to or not once he had seen angela
how wa he his wife sarah asked rather too quickly
well very worried
he said the police were talking to everyone angie had seen in the two week before she well vanished and so far had come up with nothing
i mean no one noticed anything unusual about her and she seemed to be full of plan for the wedding
well i told them that francis morgan said irritably and his wife and daughter caught each other eye in silent agreement that he had told them that angela wa refusing to be married from home and wa insisting on the full london reception at the house of common replying unanswerably when he had objected on ground of expense that she could well afford to pay for it herself
a row of epic proportion had ensued which he and angela had evidently enjoyed but which had left sarah and jennifer sick with distress
i do want to go out frank
someone might ring
sarah morgan wa sounding diffident but resolute and a morgan opened his mouth to protest in exasperation the doorbell rang
both woman looked at him in joint appeal and he marched to the door pulling it open with unnecessary force
he stood door in hand checked by something in the way his visitor a man and a woman were standing
the man a stocky greying in a navy raincoat over a suit his hair cut short wa attended by a uniformed policewoman hair smartly set under the cap her eye watchful in the wide flat placid face and both of them were standing square and stolid
francis morgan stood and stared at them and even before the man stepped forward steadily hand extended mouth opening to speak he understood who they were and what they had come to tell him
mark sander returned from istanbul feeling exhausted depressed and ill
the blinding headache he had been experiencing in recent week were taking their toll and he looked grey and drawn when he arrived home
lately georgina had been worried by the general deterioration in his appearance
but now she wa visibly shocked by the drained and face which kissed her
she wanted to say you look awful darling but decided against it
what kind of a trip have you had she asked instead
oh not too bad he replied wearily
she took his suitcase and placed it at the bottom of the stair
come into the kitchen and we will have a cup of tea
i so much news to tell you
all sort of thing seem to have happened while you have been away this time
mark smiled thinly and kissed her affectionately on the cheek
tell me about it he replied
i could do with a good laugh
why darling
what the matter
trouble at
mark slipped an arm around her slim waist a they walked from the hall into the kitchen
perhaps it old montezuma revenge he replied
must be getting too old for this lark or else my youth is catching up on me
i rapidly coming to the conclusion that this is a young man game
nonsense mark
you still a young man well youngish she said trying to tease him out of his apparent lethargy and depression
let have that cup of tea and you feel better
ah fill the cup what boot it to repeat how time is slipping underneath our foot he quoted with a sigh
oh darling
what a sad sack we are today
is that how you feel
shall i accompany you on the violin
now let me tell you all the news
she poured the tea
christopher ha been promoted after only one year
the chairman of the company told him he wa most impressed with the contribution he made to the business and that he could go right to the top if he keep it up
i knew you be delighted to hear that
she sipped her tea
next
i found a super husband for harriet
champion of the breed at crufts last year
life in the next village believe it or not
absolutely magnificent dog
lucky harriet said mark
what else
ah yes a secretary at the ministry of industry want you to ring him
seems they want you to address the european commission on european industrial development
in dublin i think she said
something about the factor which influence location decision
anyway you know what it mean when you see it
i written it all down
oh and yes a chap from conservative central office rang up to say they like to know if you would be prepared to stand for the european parliament
he sounded somewhat to the right of genghis khan
i said i did think so a you were rather busy but i pas the message on
hope i did the right thing
i said you never knew where you were from one week to the next
he said that would do nicely
just like the american express advertisement
perfect credential apparently for european parliamentarian
now what next
the have bought an absolutely super villa in sardinia and say we could rent it if we like to
i seen the photograph
gorgeous location overlooking a quiet bay
it sleep ten with a permanent staff of three
only a thousand pound a week yacht included
i love that for two or three week would you
we would want to stint ourselves mark said facetiously four or five i should think
and we could take the family she said
we have had a family holiday for year
i like that
but we can talk about that later
and i decided to take up riding again
do ask me why
just got the urge that all
she gave him a beautiful smile which lit her lovely face
well how that for starter she asked
he had heard that expression before
is there more
now let me see
ah yes
andrew coming home for the weekend so i thought it would be nice to have a drink party
i invited the bunker if that all right
i like clem and gwen and the girl would be nicer company for andrew
fine agreed mark without much enthusiasm
if clem can make it that is
i heard about this latest merseyside strike in istanbul
could finish off the uk vehicle division he said forlornly and don peter he added shaking his head
some of the stupid bastard wo be satisfied until we no longer make a single vehicle in the uk
then i suppose they say it all management fault and people will believe them
and who the hell is management he demanded his voice rising
people like me who worked their gut out to expand the business while the militant bastard have been working their gut out to destroy it
georgina wa nodding agreement
she patted his wrist
i quite sure you right dear
but we were talking about the motor industry and the saga
we were talking about andrew coming home for the weekend and having the bunker round for drink
and i do wish you would swear like that when you talk about business
you never used to swear you know
at least you did when you were with me
but you do now darling and i do wish you would
you are becoming so hard and bitter and it not really like you
mark sighed
i sorry
it just
it just that there really is trouble at she said quietly
that it is it
you were going to tell me
you were just going to worry about it alone
you let me go rabitting on
he hugged her kissed her cheek
i not sure yet that there really is something to worry about
but you think there is
he nodded
i have a horrible feeling that um is about to reorganise planning operation and if that happens it curtain for the european organisation and for me
curtain she said
what exactly would that mean
early retirement
mark you not serious
i think it could be on the card
they could transfer me to detroit or somewhere
i do know but i do like the sign
oh mark she said
they would do that to you
they just could
not after all you done for the corporation
they could be that unfair and ruthless
his expression wa wry
my dear they do whatever they feel is necessary to do
sentiment loyalty service and track record none of these thing will come into it
georgina took him in her arm and kissed him on the lip
it all so ridiculous that we not going to even think about it any more she said firmly hiding her fear
now come into the garden she added smiling
i want to show you the clematis
it a mass of colour
lying in bed that evening they talked a lot about their life together
they recalled their first day
the county ball
the paul jones and the emotional somersault when the music stopped and they came face to face for the very first time
the wedding
the birth of their first son adam and then christopher and andrew
the child growing up with all the laughter and tear
schooldays and the void they both felt when the boy went off to boarding school followed by the joy unconfined when they came home at the end of term
mark promotion and progress up the company ladder
new and changing home
friend lost and friend gained
family achievement and disappointment
notwithstanding current problem which they discussed lightly it had all been wonderful
they fell asleep in the early hour of the morning holding hand
the next day mark arrived back at um european headquarters in london and received an early call from muldoon
he went down the airless corridor to his bos office said hello to the secretary and walked into the large room which wa a big a the lobby of many a sizeable hotel
muldoon rose immediately from his enormous black leather chair to greet him coming from behind the vast desk with hand outstretched
hello mark
have a good trip
he took the englishman by the arm and ushered him toward the easy chair arranged around a long rectangular coffee table
instinctively mark felt uneasy
why the hand on the arm and the approach
muldoon never emerged from behind his desk to greet colleague
only visitor and vip got that special reception
muldoon poured the coffee
how did the planning meeting go
mark asked him
what wa nate reaction
did he and the committee go along with my proposal he added
it went fine muldoon said
he seemed somewhat uneasy
klepner did a good job
how did he handle the question
mark asked
he doe have the inside knowledge to deal with question
oh ok really
i handled some and so did mueller
but klepner did ok
he did let the side down
mark nodded
what wa mueller doing answering question
he wa there to ask them
he doe know the inside track any more than klepner
maybe not but he soon will muldoon replied quietly
and what doe that mean
muldoon seemed to be taking a long time over his coffee
he evaded mark eye
he goin to world planning operation from detroit
he already the regional plan to provide a world picture
so what changed
deep down he knew
he not going to just and consolidate any longer muldoon said with increasing nervousness
he gon na plan direct and control worldwide planning operation from detroit including the regional planning function
mark expression wa one of faked incredulity
his gut feeling had been right
you got to be joking he scoffed
i know that what mueller always wanted but nate and the executive committee would never fall for that bloody game
the region are far too big and complex to be handled from detroit and even if they were foolish enough to believe that they could do it more effectively which they ca they would be crazy to try
i know mark i know muldoon said
but that what they gon na do
it will boomerang the englishman said heatedly
overseas government and local national just wo stand for it particularly when they get to know what going on
that one corporate plan that ca win not in the long term
i know mark
but they think they can run everything from detroit and that the way the organisation is going to be restructured
they are working on it right now
we will know the detail in a few week time
couple of month at the latest
mark said quietly
and how doe that affect the european organisation
the organisation will be wound up
i taking early retirement
and me
muldoon shrugged
not certain yet
but my guess is early retirement too unless you prepared to go back to divisional work
local md perhaps
the englishman snorted
you know i ca go back
who the hell can
in any case you know a well a i do that the md are always american
well there wo be any european job function that for sure muldoon said
there be a direct link between detroit and the line manager in each country with detroit calling the shot
do they realise they playing with political dynamite
mark demanded
mueller wo give a damn about the effect of a corporate plan on europe and on individual country
if he want to import vehicle or component from taiwan or singapore or hong kong into europe he go ahead and do it regardless of the economic consequence for the european country concerned
the only thing you can be sure of is that u interest will always come first
oh and there one more thing you can be sure of he added sourly
they wo plan to supply the u market from import
you can bet your bottom dollar on that
jesus wept he continued hackle rising
mueller will have the power to make or break whole area of europe
he the last guy in the world who should be given such power
the bloody man power drunk already
he wa angry and bitter
i know muldoon agreed sadly
then what are you and clancy doing about it
look mark muldoon said forlornly what the point
the wheel have already been set in motion
we not gon na change anyone mind
you know that
his tone wa abject
sorry you takin it so bad he added miserably
how else should i take it
mark demanded
it my life which is about to go down the plughole
i not an american on a brief overseas assignment
i spent my entire working life in the european component business
i grown up in it
it in my blood
i built plant and managed them
designed product and marketed and sold them
when i wa an apprentice there were two component plant in europe and now there are seventeen and i had a hand in establishing the last twelve
what the hell do you expect me to say
oh is that what they are proposing to do
well bully for mueller and the corporation
i go and collect my hat and coat
i know how you feel mark muldoon said sadly
do you pat
do you
you and have been looking forward to retirement
i fifty and have a long way to go
i do think you can see thing the way i see them
well perhaps not muldoon agreed
but i can understand how you feel
the englishman nodded and poured himself more coffee
so what going to happen to the european plan he asked
mueller will drive it from detroit with one or two amendment agreed at the epc meeting muldoon told him
what amendment
no further plant investment in the uk
i suppose mueller saw to that mark said sarcastically
he really hate our gut
god help the british plant under the new regime
muldoon shook his head
no it wa that
it wa the strike at merseyside
that wa the last straw a far a nate wa concerned
up until that news hit the committee don had won the day with his uk vehicle division proposal
but a soon a nate heard about the latest strike that wa it
end of story
he instructed mueller to vehicle manufacture in the uk
mark nodded
how did don take it
he wa beginning to win through
he very upset
naturally
it the first time in his career he ha come out on top
mueller is taking over the plan and don is being transferred back to the state
public relation job or something similar
just think of it a man of his talent and ability stooging around the medium
so when he going back to the state
mark said
it wo be announced for a week or so but he already been told
he fly out inside the month
and what do you and i do now
mark enquired
start emptying the file
muldoon made a face
afraid so
klepner will take over the file and ship them back to the state
he be mueller european component planning manager in detroit
klepner
mark uttered in mock astonishment
the man know nothing about europe
he a novice
a bloody charlatan
i know it sound crazy mark muldoon said
but there it is
we have no choice in the matter
i wa instructed to tell you and i have
new york and detroit will come up with an attractive separation package you can be sure of that
they already told me you get the maximum term permitted under british law
the corporation want to do the right thing by you
the two men rose from the table together
sure
we have no choice in the matter said the englishman
there ha to be loser a well a winner said the american
i guess we both loser mark
the englishman returned to his own palatial office and sat with his head in hand
another of his blinding headache had developed and he felt a tight sensation in his chest which made breathing very painful and difficult
his secretary entered the room
can i get you a coffee mr sander
you do look at all well
shall i get the doctor
he looked up and smiled
no thank you millie
i all right
just a headache
be ok in a minute
would love a cup of coffee though
are you sure i should get a doctor she asked
no thank you
i be ok
it only a headache
millie had her reason for being concerned
the petticoat mafia at the top of the organisation always knew what wa going on often before the top executive themselves
millie and the secretary of pat muldoon and clancy mcgillicuddy were all close friend
they had got together over the weekend to discus the implication of the confidential letter the two american had received from randy mueller on behalf of nate cocello
major change were afoot which affected their respective boss
by the time mark reached home that evening the pain in his head were excruciating
he decided against telling georgina about his meeting with muldoon
he would wait for the right moment
this wa it
homicide
this chapter deal with the approach of the criminal law to behaviour which cause or risk causing death
murder manslaughter and several other offence are discussed and one recurrent issue here is whether english law responds proportionately to the different degree of culpability manifested in case where death is caused
death and finality
for practical purpose the culpable causing of another person death may fairly be regarded a the most serious offence in the criminal calendar
there is an argument that treason is a more serious offence since it strike at the very foundation of the state and it social organization but treason is so rare that it is surely permissible to treat homicide a the most serious form of crime
the reason for this is not difficult to find the harm caused by many other crime is remediable to a degree whereas the harm caused by homicide is absolutely irremediable
even in crime of violence which leave some permanent physical disfigurement or psychological effect the victim retains his or her life and therefore the possibility of further pleasure and achievement whereas death is final
this finality make it proper to regard death a the most serious harm that may be inflicted on another and to regard a person who chooses to inflict that harm a the most culpable of offender in the absence of some excuse or justification
although many death arise from natural cause and many others from illness and disease each year see a large number of death caused by accident and also a number caused by act or omission which amount to some form of homicide in english law
for the statistic show that there were some accidental death of which some occurred in the home at work and on the road
by comparison the number of death recorded a criminal homicide wa which includes all the murder and manslaughter
this figure is relatively small when compared with many american city but that is no cause for satisfaction
there are still awkward question to be confronted
for example are we satisfied that the death recorded a homicide are in fact more culpable than all or even most of the death recorded a accident
in other word doe english criminal law pick out the most heinous form of killing a murder and manslaughter or are the boundary frozen by tradition
another question is whether the criminal law ought not to be wider in it application to activity which carry some risk of causing death than in other sphere
thus even if it would be excessive to sweep large number of the death now recorded a accident into the law of homicide there may be sufficient justification for creating or enforcing offence designed to ensure safe condition of work safe good safe building and so on
it wa argued in chapter that the criminal law ought to spread it net wider where the potential harm is greater
it will be seen that english law doe this up to a point and in the process seems to accept argument a reason for departing from several of the principle set out in chapter
requirement of criminal homicide
english law distinguishes between the offence of murder and manslaughter a we shall see but the two crime do have certain common element
it must be proved that the defendant act or omission caused the death of the victim within a year and a day
the requirement of causation in the criminal law are discussed elsewhere
the year and a day rule is a legacy of time when medical science wa so rudimentary that if there wa a substantial lapse of time between injury and death it wa unsafe to pronounce on whether the defendant conduct or some other event caused the death
nowadays the problem is quite the reverse medical science is generally able to determine whether d conduct caused the death and innovation such a machine mean that life can be prolonged for month and year in some instance
in one recent case the victim of a stabbing died two and a half year after the incident having been kept on a machine for almost the entire time
in principle it seems unjust that a homicide conviction should not be possible in such a case if all the other element can be established and only the year and a day rule stand in the way
but the rule wa confirmed by the criminal law revision committee in on the ground that a defendant should not be left in peril of a homicide conviction indefinitely
surely prosecutorial discretion should be enough to prevent unfair conviction year after the event
the rule itself is out of accord with modern medical condition and should be abolished
defining murder the inclusionary question
a the procedural context
if causing death is to be regarded a the most serious harm that can be inflicted it would seem to follow that the most blameworthy form of homicide should result in the highest sentence imposed by the court
indeed many system of criminal law impose a mandatory sentence for murder or whatever the highest form of homicide is called in that system
in some jurisdiction this is a mandatory sentence of death
in others such a those in the united kingdom it is the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment
why should this penalty be mandatory and not at the discretion of the court a in other offence
one argument in favour of the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment is that it amount to a symbolic indication of the unique heinousness of murder
it place the offender under the state control a it were for the remainder of his or her life
this is often linked with a supposed denunciatory effect the idea that the mandatory life sentence denounces murder a emphatically a possible and with a supposed general deterrent effect in declaring that there is no mitigation of sentence available for this crime
it might also be argued that the mandatory life sentence make a substantial contribution to public safety
none of these argument is notably strong let alone conclusive
the mandatory penalty doe indeed serve to mark out murder from other crime but whether the definition of murder is sufficiently refined to capture the worst killing and only the worst killing remains to be discussed below
whether the life sentence is regarded a a sufficient denunciation in society depends on the public perception of what life imprisonment mean if it is widely believed that it result in an average of nine year imprisonment the effect will be somewhat blunted
the same applies to the general deterrent argument it effectiveness depends on whether the penalty for murder affect the calculation of potential killer at all and if it doe whether life imprisonment is seen a significantly more or le severe than the alternative of a long sentence
a for public protection this depends on executive decision with regard to release it fails to take into account whether it is necessary for public protection to keep lifer in for so long
this brings the discussion to a crucial point what doe the sentence of life imprisonment mean in practice and what would be the alternative
what it mean is that the time of release from prison is determined by the home secretary on the advice of the parole board and the lord chief justice rather than by the judge at the trial
in procedural term therefore the life sentence involves a transfer of function normally it is the judge who determines the sentence or at least it upper limit since earlier release on parole may be possible whereas a life sentence entrusts that function to the executive who must first ascertain the opinion of the lord chief justice and the trial judge
the home office is not bound by those opinion and appears to depart from them frequently
in the home secretary imposed restriction on the release of person serving life for murder of and terrorist killing murder during robbery and the sadistic or sexual murder of young child fixing a minimum of twenty year imprisonment for these offender
whatever the justification for introducing this policy it serf to underline the fact that sentencing in murder case is enacted without each case being considered individually after hearing representation from the offender counsel and without a sentence announced in court and subject to appeal
at present the executive take decision to release some murderer after only a few year and to keep others in prison for extremely long period
should those decision not be taken by the court in the same way a other sentencing decision
the answer sometimes given is that murderer should be treated differently because they are particularly dangerous anyone who chooses to kill once can choose to kill again
but this argument will seem le persuasive when we have discussed case of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility where a murder is reduced to manslaughter the judge ha a wide sentencing discretion and may according to the fact of the case select a determinate prison sentence a hospital order or life imprisonment
those who kill and are convicted of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility are no le dangerous than those convicted of murder and yet the judge ha sentencing discretion in one case and not in the other
consideration of this kind have led the house of lord select committee on murder and life imprisonment to recommend the abolition of the mandatory sentence for murder
in it place would be a sentencing discretion which judge would use in many case to mark the relative heinousness of the murder by a determinate prison sentence
in case where life imprisonment wa thought to be the appropriate sentence the trial judge would still specify in open court the number of year to be spent in prison taking the gravity of the offence into account and release would be determined by a judicial tribunal
such a reform would bring improvement in natural justice without loss of public protection
b degree of homicide
english criminal law ha two degree of homicide murder and manslaughter
many american jurisdiction have three degree of murder murder requiring premeditation and and murder covering lesser shade of culpability
in england there ha been a proposal that we should do away with all these distinction leaving a single offence of criminal homicide
that proposal if implemented would shift almost all the in homicide case from the trial to the sentencing stage the only issue of any consequence in most case would be the sentence to be imposed and all the distinction now drawn at the stage of criminal liability would be reflected in the sentence alone
the jury would have no role in most homicide case since a plea of guilty would be the norm
contrast this with the position in jurisdiction where there are three or more degree of homicide plea of guilty to and murder would be le frequent since there would be the possibility of argument in court if no bargain wa struck beforehand between prosecution and defence and the defence might succeed in persuading the jury to reduce the degree of the killing
moreover the borderline between the various degree would raise question of law which would provide much opportunity for legal argument and for appeal
the result would be that killing were classified and labelled in a more refined way but at the cost of lengthy trial and mounting bill
that cost is not difficult to justify where capital punishment is the penalty for murder
where there is no capital punishment however the question of how many degree of homicide it is desirable to have call for careful weighing of the principle of fair labelling see chapter l against the cost and time argument mobilised by the policy of efficient administration see chapter m
the structure of the english law of homicide is rather strange
although there are two offence murder and manslaughter the latter includes two distinct variety voluntary manslaughter killing which would be murder but for the existence of defined extenuating circumstance and involuntary manslaughter killing for which there is no need to prove any awareness of the risk of death being caused but for which there is thought to be sufficient fault to justify criminal liability
the argument therefore tend to focus on three borderline question what is the minimum fault required for conviction of murder
what condition are needed to reduce murder to manslaughter
and what is the minimum fault required for a conviction of manslaughter
c requirement for murder
in english criminal law there are now two alternative fault requirement for murder an intent to kill or an intent to cause grievous bodily harm
what do these requirement mean
do they extend the definition of murder too far or are they too narrow
intent to kill may be regarded a the most obvious and indisputable form of fault element for murder but to some extent that depends on the meaning of intent
this ha been the subject of a number of house of lord decision and yet the definition is still not clear and settled
probably the most accurate statement would be that a person intends to kill if it is his or her purpose to kill by the act or omission charged or if he or she foresees that death is practically certain to follow from that act or omission
in this way both purpose and foresight of practical certainty are regarded a part of the definition of intent although there are other statement suggesting that foresight of practical or virtual certainty is merely evidence from which intent may be inferred
how would this test be applied
in many case the word intent is used without elaboration but there are some for which a full explanation of the meaning of intention is necessary
a fairly typical set of fact is provided by nedrick where d had a grudge against a woman and had threatened to burn her out
one night he went to her house poured paraffin through the and on to the front door and set it alight
one of the woman child died in the ensuing fire
when asked why he did it d replied just to wake her up and frighten her
a defence of this kind a claim that the purpose wa only to frighten and not to cause harm requires the full definition to be put to the jury
the question is granted that d purpose wa to frighten did he nonetheless realize that it wa practically certain that his act would cause death or grievous bodily harm to someone
the jury should answer this by drawing inference from the evidence in the case and from the surrounding circumstance
what about the alternative element in the definition an intent to cause grievous bodily harm
this ha considerable practical importance since this is all that the prosecution ha to prove in order to obtain a verdict of guilty of murder
it must be shown that the defendant intended which again includes both purpose and awareness of practical certainty to cause really serious injury to someone
the house of lord confirmed this rule in cunningham d struck his victim on the head a number of time with a chair causing injury from which the victim died a week later
d maintained throughout that he had not intended to kill but there wa evidence from which the jury could infer and did infer that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm
the house of lord upheld d conviction for murder an intent to cause really serious injury is sufficient for murder without any proof that the defendant intended or even contemplated the possibility that death would result
doe the grievous bodily harm rule extend the definition of murder too far
if the point of distinguishing murder from manslaughter is to mark out the most heinous group of killing for the extra stigma of a murder conviction it can be argued that the grievous bodily harm rule draw the line too low
in term of principle the rule requires justification because it departs from the principle of correspondence see chapter a namely that the fault element in a crime should relate to the consequence prohibited by that crime
by allowing an intent to cause grievous bodily harm to suffice for a murder conviction the law is violating a general principle turning the most serious of it offence into a constructive crime
why should it be necessary to construct a murder conviction out of this lesser intent
there are argument in favour of this death is final murder is the gravest crime and there is no significant moral difference between someone who chooses to cause really serious injury and someone who set out to kill
no one can predict whether a serious injury will result in death that may depend on the victim physique on the speed of an ambulance on the distance from the hospital and on a range of other medical and individual matter
if one person chooses to cause serious injury to another it should be presumed that he or she realizes that there is always a risk of death and such case show a sufficiently wanton disregard for life a to warrant the label murder if death result
the which would uphold the principle of correspondence are that breach of that principle is unnecessary when the amplitude of the crime of manslaughter lie beneath murder and also that the definition of grievous bodily harm includes a number of injury which are most unlikely to put the victim life at risk
in the leading case of cunningham lord dissenting gave the example of breaking someone arm that is a really serious injury but one which is unlikely to endanger the victim life
so in practice the grievous bodily harm rule go further than the argument of it protagonist would support
would it be right then to confine the fault element in murder to an intent to kill
that would have the merit of simplicity but would it strike the right note socially
there are powerful argument in favour of saying that there are other killing where an intent to kill can not be established and yet where the moral or social culpability is equal to that in most intentional killing
of course one can not be adamant about whether they merit the label murder because that is a question of drawing the line between murder and manslaughter which is not susceptible of any precise resolution
it is hard to argue conclusively that the category of murder should be smaller or larger unless the death penalty or a mandatory life sentence follows it is a question of social judgment
let u briefly consider some of the possibility
the fault element for many serious offence is intent or recklessness why should this not suffice for murder
the question is whether all killing in which the defendant is aware of the risk of death are sufficiently serious to warrant the term murder
one answer sometimes given is that they are not because a driver who overtakes on a bend knowingly taking the risk that there is a car travelling in the opposite direction should not be labelled a murderer if a collision and death happen to ensue
this example assumes that a sympathy for motorist with overwhelm any tendency to logical analysis
one might ask whether motorist are ever justified in knowingly taking risk with other people life
yet if the example is modified a little so that the overtaking is on a country road at night and the risk is known to be slight it becomes questionable whether the causing of death in these circumstance should be labelled in the same way a intentional killing
this is not to suggest that motorist should be treated differently
the point is rather that even though knowingly taking risk with other people life is usually unjustifiable taking a slight risk is le serious than intentionally causing death
in discussing the boundary of murder we are concerned with classification not exculpation
to classify all reckless killing a murder might be too broad but the point remains that some reckless killing may be thought no le heinous than intentional killing
can a satisfactory line be drawn here
one approach would be to draw the line by reference to the degree of probability
murder is committed in those situation where d caused death by an act or omission which he knew had death a the probable or highly probable result
a version of this test of foresight of high probability is used in several other european country it wa introduced into english law by the decision in hyam v
dpp but abandoned in moloney on ground of uncertainty
a second approach is to frame the law in such a way a to make it clear that the court should make a moral judgment on the gravity of the defendant conduct
section of the model penal code includes within murder those reckless killing which manifest extreme indifference to the value of human life
scot law treat a murder killing with wicked recklessness a phrase which directs the court attention to the circumstance of the killing
both the model penal code test and the scot test may be reduced to circularity however for when one asks how extreme or how wicked the recklessness should be the only possible answer is wicked or extreme enough to justify the stigma of a murder conviction
admittedly the model penal code doe contain a list of circumstance which may amount to extreme indifference which assist the court and increase the predictability of verdict in a way that scot law doe not but the essence of both approach is that there is no precise way of describing those killing which are a heinous a intentional killing
their protagonist argue that the law of murder is so important socially that derogation from the principle of maximum certainty should be allowed in favour of more accurate labelling by the court opponent argue that the principle of maximum certainty is needed here specifically to reduce the risk of verdict based on discriminatory or irrelevant factor such a distaste for the defendant background allegiance or other activity
a third more precise formulation derives from the recommendation of the criminal law revision committee in namely that a killing should be classified a murder in those situation where there is an intention to cause serious injury coupled with awareness of the risk of death
neither an intention to cause serious injury nor recklessness a to death should be sufficient on it own but together they restrict one another producing a test which both satisfies the criterion of certainty and mark out some heinous but killing
a fourth approach adopted by english law until and still in force in many american jurisdiction is some form of rule anyone who kill during the course of a felony or more restrictively a serious crime of violence or whilst resisting arrest should be convicted of murder
thus stated there is no reference to the defendant intention or awareness of the risk the fact that d ha chosen to commit rape robbery or another serious offence and ha caused death thereby is held to constitute sufficient moral ground for placing the killing in the highest category
plainly this is a form of constructive criminal liability the murder conviction is constructed out of the ingredient of a lesser offence
presumably the justification is that d ha already crossed a high threshold in choosing to commit such a serious offence and should therefore be held liable for whatever consequence ensue however unforeseeable they may be
the objection would be reduced if awareness of the risk of death wa also required in other word if the test were the commission of a serious offence of violence plus recklessness a to death
the effect of that test would be to pick out those reckless killing which occurred when d had already manifested substantial moral and legal culpability and to classify them a murder
four alternative approach have been described and many others could be listed
the point is that the traditional concept of intention and recklessness do not of themselves appear to be sufficiently well focused to mark out those killing which are the most heinous
the law must resort to some kind of moral and social evaluation of conduct if it is to identify and separate out the most heinous killing
many people might think that a person who cause death whilst using an unlawfully held firearm or explosive ought to be convicted of murder because there is generally speaking no excuse for using such dangerous equipment
some of the people thus covered would be armed robber others would be terrorist
the armed robber might say that he had no intention of using the firearm that he carried it with him simply to frighten the victim and that it went off accidentally if the jury belief that should he be convicted of murder

francesca simon describes some of the pitfall and how to avoid them
by francesca simon
debbie adam had to let her east end terrace house in london in a hurry when her husband wa to ireland with two month notice
she went to a local letting agency landlord of roman road bethnal green london who found a tenant that day
she also employed landlord to manage the let
a is common practice landlord kept the tenant deposit of and told debbie they would take their entire fee of up front so she expected no rent for the first month
but july also passed without debbie receiving any money
i phoned and said where the money and wa told there were problem with the who would be coming in to sort it out say debbie
but nothing happened and i never heard from them
she repeatedly phoned landlord but wa either unable to get an answer or told that manager howard keizner wa unavailable
finally after the third month passed with no rent received debbie phoned the tenant asked them to pay her directly and sent landlord a letter which wa returned and finally one by ordinary post stating that landlord were no longer employed a the managing agent
because they had done any management debbie felt landlord were entitled only to the per cent fee and therefore owed her month rent plus the deposit
in december she sued
landlord did acknowledge the writ so in january debbie solicitor requested a judgment in default for the full amount plus interest and court fee a total of
just before the court wa due to hear the request her solicitor received a cheque for
they had paid the interest and court fee but we got back every single penny they owed
we were lucky say debbie adam
howard keizner of landlord said there were a lot of complication with this particular letting and management
but he declined further comment
last week he promised to supply u with a written explanation of the way his company had treated debbie but it never arrived
yusuf and shabira gulamali were le fortunate
they lost over dealing with two letting agency which closed down without paying them the rent and tenant deposit owed on their wembley flat
they hired the first agent dig of oxford street to manage a well a to let their flat
the gulamalis received their rent for the first three month then nothing for four month and were told the computer wa broken the account were being moved the cheque wa in the post and so on
after four month they closed down owing u say shabira
together with some other client we took the owner to court but he escaped to spain
the second time round they dealt with and letting in london who they instructed just to find a tenant
the gulamalis never received the agreement form the tenant deposit or the first month rent
finally we went to the office and they gave u a cheque which bounced
the office of r and letting are now up for sale
anyone can set up a letting agency say david galsworthy vice president of the national association of estate agent
they come and go so it pay to deal with a member of a professional body such a the naea the royal institute of chartered surveyor or the incorporated society of valuer and auctioneer
in case of a dispute you can complain to the professional body and member are bonded which mean that deposit and rent are covered in case of fraud or dishonesty
if you are thinking of letting your property the following point will help to safeguard your interest
ask any agency you are considering using if they are a member of one of the above professional association
if in doubt ask to see proof of their membership
if in addition to finding a tenant the agency is managing the let you should be paid every month le a fee of between two and four week rent
the agency will keep the tenant deposit until the tenant leaf
if the letting agent is not managing the flat the tenant deposit should be given to the owner immediately
expect to pay a management fee of up to per cent
some agency deduct it every month others want it all up front so shop around
if the owner is abroad the agent will also collect tax at the standard rate of per cent which will be deducted from your monthly rent cheque
letting agency should never charge tenant a finder fee although according to galsworthy many agency do
it not ethical a they are acting for the landlord he say
the naea ha member of which also do letting and management
but galsworthy belief there is a clear need for the licensing of all letting agent
we want everyone to be licensed but the government did think it necessary
section of the estate agent act dealing with bonding licensing and standard of competency ha not been brought in
but we must have a common code and we must have licensing he said
until then owner and tenant beware
travel copse and robber christopher somerville see how woodland ha usurped the ancient cattle thief of the cheviot hill
by christopher somerville
when a charlton chief sat down to dinner in time gone by and found a spur on the table where his meal should have been he knew the cupboard wa bare once more
his wife wa telling him to saddle up and steal a fresh batch of cattle from his neighbour herd
the family of north tynedale in westernmost northumberland charltons and robsons milburns and dodds were never slow to lay hand on each other property in the lawless old day
here where the scottish border ran across the cheviot hill far from civilisation reiving or wa a way of life
remoteness is still the keynote of this region but a charlton reiving party would be hard put to it these day to work up a good gallop along the upper reach of the north tyne river
since the western fringe of the cheviot have been planted with square mile of conifer while in their depth sprawl the seven mile of the kielder water reservoir europe largest lake
i found it hard to picture what kind of landscape those statistic might have shaped until i opened the ordnance survey map to find half of it coloured green with a great blue stain in the centre
kielder water is beautiful and the kielder tree formidably impressive in their domination of the hill
but by the time i had turned off the road from bellingham at kielder village and driven up the bumpy forest drive to east kielder farm i wa longing for the sight of something other than water and tree
relief wa at hand
the farm stand on a spur of moorland on the northern edge of the forest and within minute i had turned my back on the corduroy battalion of tree and wa striding under a still cloudy sky over tussock of rush and coarse grass with my face to the long bare shoulder of open hillside that flank the winding shallow of the east kielder burn
the footpath that run with the burn is not one of those carefully waymarked and leafleted by the forestry commission
there are few attraction for the kielder tourist here
the burn thread a wild and inhospitable crevice of the hill where the wind blow cold and the sense of isolation grows with each lonely mile
walking here you leave the century behind on the outskirt of the forest and enter the reconstructed emptiness in which the reivers and raider of the past could operate unhindered
i squelched across tiny burn running in black channel of peat and stood looking down from the hillside on to the grey roof of scaup farm
the hollow barking of a dog came from one of the stone shed but there wa no sign of life around the building
scaup must be just about the loneliest farm in england tucked down in the shelter of the hill with kielder forest dark mass blocking it southward view and the narrowing valley of the burn filling half the sky to the north
the east kielder burn divide here into scaup burn and white kielder burn
i dropped down the hill to ford white kielder upstream of the ruined farmstead of kielder head where a line of stunted alder shaggy with lichen leaned over their leafless reflection in the water
spring come late to this windbitten and valley
but there were lamb in the sheep pen of scaup and a cheery hello now from the farmer and his wife tending them
those were the last human voice i heard all day
life up here in the cleft of the white kielder burn
the rough land is altogether too harsh and unyielding giving sustenance only to sheep and to the conifer high on the flank of east kielder moor and grey mare knowe immense sweep of hillside to right and left of the valley
the footpath on the left bank of the burn wa little better than a sheep track but there were clue to it former importance a a droving road over the hill to byrness in redesdale
large boulder stood out beside the path a grey blob in the featureless sheet of pale grass and flat stone had been placed a bridge across the burn their back hollowed by the tread of foot through the century
following these now disregarded sign of past activity along the old path i traversed the hillside and came down to a crumbling stone sheepfold with the roofless remains of a shepherd hut built into one wall
the tiny single room wa jammed with the mossy timber of disused sheep pen but the little iron fire grate that once warmed the hardy men who worked here wa still set in the foot of the hut tottering gable end and the massive stone lintel had not yet fallen from it place above the doorway
a dipper flew up from the burn a i emerged from the hut his white breast flashing a he darted downstream
somewhere ahead in the crag of kielderhead moor a hawk wa whistling a piercing sound in the lonely valley overlain for a few moment by the snarl of a jet
that jarring manifestation of furious technology seemed a remote and ridiculous a a dream a silence settled down on kielderhead and the hawk whistle came down from the moor
the valley of the white kielder burn steepened again a i trudged north it curve tightening
now the path ran through heather high above the burn past circular sheepfold long disused and over the stony bed of side stream where the grass hung smooth and inviting concealing drop
a mile above the shepherd hut the hillside ceased their upward rolling and curved together to form a valley of slope five mile from the nearest tarmac road hidden deep in the fold of the moor
the old drover road turned aside here and climbed under the rock face of white crag to continue it lonely course over girdle fell and down into redesdale
i could have gone with it giving myself four blissful mile of upland walking followed by a many miserable hour of fruitless searching for return transport to east kielder farm
instead i lay back in the heather and savoured the trickle of the burn and the crisp smell of ground
not a sign of spring had yet penetrated this secret valley but another month would put that right
there were five mile of return tramping to face but they too could wait awhile
election and what can the politician do for meadowell
probably nothing at all
joyriding riot propelled tyneside meadowell estate to national prominence last september
ha the election campaign penetrated it grim street
by martyn harris
at the centre on south meadowell labour candidate paddy cosgrove ha dropped in to meet the people mostly fat lady in shellsuits with lap full of chip
you all know me say paddy and a fat lady with good timing say i do know you
never seen you in me life
on the floor a toddler peel more chip from a congealed bluish mass and feed them to a baby
another dig the cream from the centre of a pink fancy and smear it in his hair
paddy cosgrove councillor and barrister in candidate pinstripe sits tensely on the edge of his plastic chair
i a regular visitor to this estate
who doe he say he is say a second fat lady
that liberal paddy ashgrove
he better looking on tv
he only come because the press are here say the first fat lady
and paddy cosgrove blush
political consciousness is low on the meadowell estate
turnout at the last election wa around per cent and with the thinning of the electoral roll brought by the poll tax will be even lower this time
they are mostly labour voter but several confuse their labour candidate with the leader of the liberal democrat
very few know their mp is a conservative and hardly anyone that his name is neville trotter defender of a slender majority
by most measure meadowell is the worst council estate in britain and probably the most notorious since the riot last september which followed the death of joyriders colin atkins and dale robson in a police chase
in fact meadowell is an elastoplast name like sizewell invented in the to disguise what wa already a running sore
when built in it wa the ridge which is still what they call it locally a slum clearance project on the north bank of the tyne mile east of newcastle
it first inhabitant were shipyard and fishquay worker from the riverside town of north shield and wallsend who moved happily from their tumbledown terrace to these fine new house with inside toilet and garden
many like ronnie collyer a retired shipyard worker still live here and are still proud of the place
all the trouble say ronnie is down to a few family who doa keep their young un in order
and then the medium coom down and blow everything up
he ha polished shoe a close shave and too much pride for a free drink
it a canny place the ridge with plenty of good folk
but something wa wrong from the start
some say it wa the importing of whole street of fighting family from the fishquays with their dockland diversion of prostitution and handling
others say it wa the shortage of pub shop church transport and police station
by the the ridge wa the criminal ghetto of newcastle and by the a costly council manicure job had turned it into a zone
path and boundary vanished allowing the tide of street life to wash right up to the doorstep
joyriders used front lawn to practise their handbrake turn
car theft became so common that private car virtually disappeared from the area
shop like greengrocer and chippies with pitiful cash taking were routinely subjected to armed robbery with shotgun balaclava the whole bit
when i ask the fat lady at the centre what is the one thing that would do most to improve the estate they say get rid of the kid and they are only half joking
the age structure of meadowell mean it is awash with teenager whose only pastime are having baby and
do your husband come here
i ask and they all laugh
the men are all useless sitting indoors if there trouble in the street
it woman have to go out and deal with it
by the time of the riot a quarter of all house on the estate were boarded up and burned out by infant petrol bomber
unemployment wa per cent on some street
in meadowell primary which ha child every one wa receiving a clothing grant
the area had effectively been abandoned by the authority a fact which became clear during the riot itself when police waited five hour to enter the estate and put down the disturbance
and there were never more than a few dozen ringleader bob mather a local butcher tell me
i wa stood outside me shop all night and most were no more than kid
eight month on and little ha changed if anything it is rather worse
unemployment is up another per cent more house and shop are boarded up burglary and joyriding continue and if there is le it is only because or so of the hardest case are still behind bar
a food which tried to replace the shop ha been closed after several and even the centre is burgled weekly according to project worker sheila auld
there is a new phone box ripped from the wall and lying on the floor of her office to prove it
meadowell ha even discovered a new martyr in the shape of one willy hunter a local hard nut awaiting trial for murder and allegedly the victim of a police
free willy hunter say the graffiti next to the old fading graffiti for dale robson and colin atkins
my friend kevin muscleman and minicab driver say the lad would be out rioting for willy now if it wa tipping down with rain the whole time
a few thing have been achieved i suppose
there are some posh flat going up at neighbouring royal quay which will provide building job it sun city in the middle of bantustan a labour councillor said to me
the cheviot housing association is slowly taking over property in south meadowell
a new police station is to be built
the government sponsored meadowell initiative make noise in the north of the estate but doe pitifully little painfully slowly
north tyneside council say it is too starved of fund by central government to do much
tory minister like michael heseltine who visited meadowell last november say the cash shortage are due to council profligacy and bad management
mp neville trotter is a tory with vowel who ha little appeal to the people of meadowell and a dwindling appeal in the suburb where unemployment is also climbing
paddy cosgrove his likely replacement is a council hack of year standing and ideal backbench fodder though it is hard to imagine him leading a crusade for meadowell
when i ask the people of the estate what they want from this election some say they want cheviot to rebuild it and others that it would be better grassed over
some say they should bring back hanging others say it is the politician they should hang but most say there is nothing anybody can do at all

con maj
sit they said but he would this week john major began to appear on a different kind of box
in the last of his series on the leader frank johnson report
by frank johnson
we were in the west country
the prime minister wa on his soapbox
just up the road at langport in somerset wa the birthplace of walter bagehot although a he directed his microphone at liberal democrat heckler john major had other thing on his mind
the relevance is that bagehot wa the first political commentator
the travelling chaos of a modern party leader election entourage had carried major within a few mile of the home of the founder of the profession a few of whose more troublesome contemporary practitioner are said to have caused him much irritation over the month of his premiership
a liberal
he admitted to being a liberal
major cried jabbing a finger in the direction of one heckler
the man had a liberal democrat rosette pinned to his cap
he wa also carrying an orange poster on a pole urging a vote for the local liberal democrat candidate
therefore the admission which the prime minister wrung from him could hardly be said to have been grudging
but like all the best soapbox orator major had prepared his repartee in advance
i knew there wa one here he continued meaning liberal democrat
there were in fact about a score
then came the passage which appeared on the television news that evening and in the paper the next day about the liberal democrat being the trojan horse that would let labour in
there were also some line intended for local consumption higher petrol price from the liberal democrat that not gon na help a rural area
what would bagehot have made of him
like the heckler he wa a liberal
there the similarity end since judging from his writing bagehot wa a roaring snob whereas judging from his heckle the heckler wa not
more to the point it wa bagehot who said a constitutional statesman is in general a man of common opinion and uncommon ability
the statesman to whom he wa referring wa peel
a political commentator of our own day paul johnson quoted it not long after major became prime minister to suggest that it wa also true of him
but is it still
b agehot phrase come in a passage in which he appears to propound the dispiriting theory that a politician if he want to get anywhere must appeal to the average man
the average man is a cool common person with a considerate air with figure in his mind with his own business to attend to with a set of ordinary opinion arising from and suited to ordinary life
he ca bear novelty or originality
original theory give trouble
bagehot go on to say of peel from a certain peculiarity of intellect and fortune he wa never in advance of his time
of almost all the great measure with which his name is associated he attained great eminence a an opponent before he attained even greater eminence a their advocate
that last sentence ha more to do with kinnock than with major
it is also a warning to all hack tory who think that it is a telling blow against kinnock to keep on pointing out that he ha reversed his opinion about unilateral nuclear disarmament british membership of the ec or anything else
but the most striking thing about bagehot essay on peel in the light of the last full week of this election campaign is that it simply doe not apply to major at all
common opinion were what got major into difficulty in the first place
between his becoming prime minister and his party fall in the poll about day ago major did nearly everthing that common opinion wanted him to do
this wa true of what he did about both high policy and low politics
for example on high policy common opinion said that there wa nothing for it but to stay in the erm
he stayed in and the recession worsened
in low politics common opinion no le common for being expensively hired by conservative central office encouraged him in the belief that he should fight much of the election sitting down
he did so and he looked like the questioner in the studio audience rather than the answerer
the result wa wobbly week the second week of the campaign
but last saturday major climbed on to that soapbox in luton
until then he had been that most inhuman of creature the public figure described by others a very human
now he really wa human unscripted jokey even a bit passionate
the jubilant word from kinnock camp wa that major wa behaving more like an opposition leader than a prime minister
but there seemed nothing wrong with the head of government appearing to be the challenger on the hustings
president truman did so in a campaign which expected him to win and he won
it is justified if the head of government is challenging something powerful
kinnock complains of the alleged power of the tory tabloid press but he ha power on his side too
ninety per cent of his party cash come from the union which will expect a return
the british people have in the past found them rather more powerful than the corporation which are popularly supposed to finance the conservative party
then there are all those schoolteacher don television producer writer on art page and member of the agitating class who want a labour win in order to impose political correctness
that is to say they will have what the jesuit once attached such importance to power over young or impressionable mind
a the week went by major rejected common opinion about two other large subject proportional representation and scottish devolution
he hardened his opposition to both despite the fact that his own party chairman had once favoured the first and vocal force within his scottish party were in support of the second
e ven at this late hour psephology demographic and luck suggest that the tory could still emerge a the biggest single party in a hung parliament
is it possible that major would rather go into opposition with the danger that would mean for his continued leadership of the conservative party than offer pr and scottish devolution to the liberal democrat
if so we are dealing with a more quixotic romantic or principled figure than some of u used to think
once that soapbox came out major campaigned a if he would now do and say what he really thought
wa it too late
from central office and from around his entourage came the unmistakable sign of friend preparing to detach themselves from blame for defeat
and then on thursday morning when major election tour reached the daily mail ideal home exhibition sir david english the paper editor wa not there to greet him
a junior spin doctor is reported to have muttered though admittedly out of my earshot we been snubbed
not sir david
some in the profession of political commentating would opt for bagehot a their formative influence but mine ha long been sir david a founder of biased tory journalism
his lack of humbug about political balance ha always made him more honest than all the employee of bbc current affair awaiting with glee the kinnock year
eventually sir david office issued a statement about the prime minister
normally a prime minister office would issue a statement about an editor
but major make a point of not being grand and with sir david it is the other way about
sir david english wa not informed of the visit and in consequence had no plan to attend the ideal home exhibition that day the official statement announced
faith in sir david leadership wa restored
scientist click over a way to save dolphin
by greg neale environment correspondent
hundred of thousand of dolphin could be saved from death thanks to pioneering work by british scientist
they believe they have found a cheap practical mean of preventing dolphin entangling themselves in monofilament drift fishing net the wall of death believed to be responsible for killing large number of dolphin off cornwall this year
but their work is hampered by lack of money
so far they have received nothing from the government little ec assistance and are running out of fund donated by individual and industry
the researcher headed by dr margaret klinowska a cambridge biologist and david goodson an expert on acoustic engineering at loughborough university say new data show that plastic sound reflector to fishing net can warn dolphin of hazard
data to be published shortly draw on experiment including observation of freddy the dolphin that ha been living off the northumbrian coast for four year
using equipment donated by racal the scientist have analysed recording of the clicking dolphin make while hunting
observation of freddy led them to conclude that dolphin use sonar while hunting
they emit an intense click or pulse of sound
echo of the signal alert them to possible prey at range up to metre in shallow water
mr goodson who became interested in the sonar capacity of dolphin after hearing one while swimming off the welsh coast ha experimented with various shape of sound reflector
the most promising is eliptical about long
the theory is that it internal air pocket will bounce back the dolphin sonar signal regardless of the direction of approach
last autumn dr klinowska mr goodson and their team put the theory into practice
in the moray firth they placed a headline barrier from which they had suspended reflector at interval
the movement of dolphin around the barrier wa observed using electronic equipment to monitor sonar activity
the result exceeded our expectation said mr goodson
dolphin swimming near the barrier altered their behaviour to avoid it the result the scientist believe of them detecting sonar echo from the reflector
dr klinowska said that although it wa necessary to be cautious about the finding a combination of reflector device and some modification of fishing gear might reduce death
but the moray firth experiment were only possible after the naturalist dr david bellamy helped secure a donation from the wholesale society
our work is being delayed simply through the lack of funding said dr klinowska
the scientist hope to raise through an appeal by windsor safari park
donation can be made to the dolphin research project windsor safari park windsor berkshire

the art in the name of charity
by lewis jones
charity is a divine attribute but we are enjoined to give forgetfully lest we fall into the absurd error of mistaking ourselves for god
the peril of ignoring this advice were well illustrated by angel of bengal the true story documentary by anna raphael which wa by turn hilarious and enraging
the angel in question wa an american woman who call herself rytasha
apart from a particularly and alarming contact lens rytasha is rather beautiful and in the when she went by the name of ricki she wa a successful model she began life a maxine shenkman
an earlier film by raphael the persuader charted the transformation of ricki into rytasha which occurred at the hare krishna temple in london and her uneasy relationship with her guru there
it would have been interesting to have seen the two film together
since rytasha ha broken awayfrom her guru and set up on her own with a charity called food relief international which raise money from the fiercely competitive matron of palm beach and distributes it to the starving people of bangladesh
she adaws bangladesh gushed rytasha mother the fiercest matron of them all rejoicing in the improbable title of baroness thea von theilheimer shenkman
she went on to list her daughter achievement she put in an irritation system
with no trace of a smile or a blush the baroness quickly corrected herself an irrigation system but the slip wa a telling one and i sure they would have appreciated it in bangladesh
the villager of ramsala recipient of the palm beach dollar explained to the camera that they desperately needed a clinic
we told her that a mud hut would do but she said no she build something pukka
a pukka building wa duly erected but it medical function ha somehow been indefinitely postponed
it is devoted instead to the worship of the charitable rytasha who is not content simply to hand over the cash but insists in an unfortunate hangover from her hare krishna day on posturing a a spiritual master
the villager seemed unimpressed but were given no choice in the matter
nor could the vaunted irrigation scheme be described a an unqualified success
the money ran out before the scheme completion and the villager found themselves obliged to borrow the rest
they begged rytasha for reimbursement but none wa forthcoming and for the want of a few hundred pound the village lost it crop for the year
now what are we supposed to do asked one of them
are we to sell our cattle or our land
the most irritating thing about rytasha and there were many wa that though she doe not speak their language she presumes to teach them a spurious form of their own religion
one thing we do need in this subcontinent professor rokeya kabeer observed is spiritual guidance we have guru a dime a dozen
they are far too civilised for that sort of thing in bangladesh but i kept thinking wistfully of eliot line in sweeney agonistes about a nice little white little missionary stew
city lloyd member fail in bid to protect cash fund
by karen cooper
more than lloyd of london member on syndicate managed by the gooda walker agency have failed in their legal attempt to prevent lloyd and member agent from drawing down their fund
michael freeman the solicitor who advised the member on court action said yesterday this will cause the most dreadful hardship
there is going to be a great deal of pain in the market place now
in an earlier than expected commercial court judgment mr justice saville found that the member had not produced enough evidence of irregularity in the lmx spiral which sends catastrophe risk swirling round the market to stop the usual process of calling on cash deposit to make good syndicate loss
however he suggested there wa perhaps a need to look into the system more closely
cost were awarded to the member agent but not to lloyd
the member many of whom are unable to fulfil the latest cash call due on march to cover loss on syndicate were seeking an interim injunction to stop member agent and lloyd dipping into their security
they were challenging the pay now sue later principle at lloyd which say name should pay cash call first and fight them later
lloyd chairman david coleridge welcomed the judgment
we have every sympathy with those who have made substantial underwriting loss in recent year but lloyd owes it first duty to policyholder with valid claim which must be met he said
mr freeman said an appeal wa most unlikely because we are not going to get any more evidence
earlier this month preliminary finding from an investigation by kenneth randall found that the gooda walker agency may have overstated it syndicate profit between and through the use of time and distance policy about which it had failed to inform it auditor in at least one syndicate
peter nutting who led the association of outhwaite member to a succesful settlement said he sympathised with gooda walker name but if the name were not going to pay these call who did they think wa going to pay them
meanwhile member who were not part of the outhwaite settlement have voted to press their claim for compensation through the outhwaite name association
it plan to issue a protective writ but is hoping to achieve a settlement
the nh is not for sale virginia bottomley talk to george jones in her first interview since joining the cabinet
by george jones
the new health secretary mr virginia bottomley set herself an ambitious target yesterday to take the politics out of the national health service
but her desire to provide a period of stability for nearly one million people employed by the nh is coupled with a fierce determination to maintain the momentum of reform with the overwhelming majority of hospital becoming trust by the
labour sought to turn the general election into a referendum on the nh asking voter for a mandate to reverse the change
mr bottomley is convinced the tory victory provides the opportunity to entrench the reform and to give doctor nurse and manager the confidence to make them work
in her first full interview since being appointed health secretary she said the election result and mr major unequivocal commitment to the nh had finally nailed the lie about privatisation of health care
the nh is not for profit
it is not for sale
it will continue to be true to it founding principle available to all and free at the point of delivery she said
she recalled a promise made by mr major when he became prime minister that he would work for a nation at ease with itself
i want to see a health service at ease with itself optimistic and confident about it essential work
health is something which touch every individual and family in the country she said
but there must be change
an organisation that doe change fossilises
health need to develop and alter
by next year she is confident that two third of hospital will have become trust within the nh
she pledged that the government would safeguard those that did not opt for trust status but she expected this to be a minority
the government will also encourage more family doctor to hold budget to buy service for patient and is looking at way to enable smaller practice to team up to secure the advantage of fund holding
the election result ha given the conservative five year in which to press ahead with the change
most people are likely to judge the reform on how long they have to wait for treatment the issue behind the jennifer ear controversy during the election campaign
mr bottomley stressed her commitment to the patient charter which ha already eliminated almost all wait of more than two year for nh operation
the next step is to ensure that from march no one should have to wait more than month for a hip or knee replacement or a cataract operation
a national standard will also be set for outpatient waiting time
mr bottomley first big test a health secretary will come this summer with the annual public spending round which will be conducted against a background of concern over high government borrowing and pressure from the tory right for public spending cut
the conservative manifesto contained a commitment to increase year by year the level of real resource committed to the nh though it put no figure on the extra money to be allocated
mr bottomley representing caring conservatism will face mr michael portillo the new treasury chief secretary who is equally keen to establish his credential by demonstrating he can keep keep a tight grip on the public purse string
she acknowledged that there could be difficult time ahead
it will always be the case that the holder of my office will need to fight the corner of the health service and there will always inevitably be more than we can do
but she stressed there would be no in the search for greater efficiency
a well a fighting for more money her task wa to ensure that every last pound wa spent a effectively a it could be
her priority include giving more encouragement to medical research emphasis on preventive health to make the nh a health a well a a sickness service with the publication shortly of new national target for reducing death from heart disease and cancer and pressing ahead with care in the community
a a former psychiatric social worker mr bottomley is determined to improve standard of care for mentally ill and handicapped people
it is not acceptable to have people who require a home confined to institution when they could be in more domestic setting
that is a real challenge she said

a paradigm of probation practice some sobering thought singer
lawrence singer is an assistant chief probation officer with merseyside probation service
beforehand he worked a a probation officer for berkshire probation service and later a a research officer for somerset probation service where he undertook the research reported here
the paradigm which is described originates from doctoral research into generic probation practice and ha been presented in a book adult probation and juvenile supervision beyond the dilemma gower
summary
the government white paper crime justice and protecting the public proposes a radical change for probation practice
henceforth probation work will no longer be an alternative to punishment but an alternative form of punishment
this article challenge the conceptual and practical appropriateness of applying the notion of punishment to the probation context
probation officer it is argued are concerned with establishing rule for probationer and not inflicting pain on them
an alternative paradigm of probation practice is described
the paradigm is based on the joint supervisory aim of support and surveillance which are implemented through the method of counselling assisting directing and monitoring
to illustrate the paradigm reference is made to an alcohol education course developed for offender in trouble through drink
the efficacy of the alcohol project and the paradigm is demonstrated by the result reported from a three year evaluation study covering offender
the article concludes with an affirmation of the disciplined but character of current probation work and argues that to successfully protect the public and reintegrate offender into the community the probation officer employment of established social work knowledge skill and value is a strength not a weakness
the aim of this article is to challenge the assertion contained in the white paper crime justice and protecting the public home office that probation practice can be conceived of a a form of punishment in the community
issue will be taken with the appropriateness of applying the concept of punishment to the probation context through reference to a demanding and successful probation project concerned with offender in trouble through drink
in describing the project a model for understanding probation practice will be developed
this paradigm will provide a framework for contrasting the efficacy of current practice with future plan inappropriately to transform probation work into a new approach to punishment in the community para
the punitive approach anticipated for the probation service in the white paper is underpinned by a definition of punishment that resides in the restriction on liberty and in the enforcement of the order
the white paper go on to emphasize it is the loss of liberty involved in carrying out the term of the order rather than the activity carried out during the order which is the punishment para
notwithstanding the popular appeal and political capital to be derived from such a statement this definition is nevertheless at variance with the traditional understanding of the meaning of punishment
discourse on punishment and dictionary definition of the term clearly specify the central feature of punishment a being the infliction of pain rather than the loss of liberty per se hudson
the conceptual and practical implication of this discrepancy will be examined in the third and final section of this article
beforehand however consideration will be given first to the probation project and second to it evaluation
in these section punishment will be understood to mean the infliction of pain and the review of the project will seek to demonstrate that the probation practice described is not only more demanding but also more effective than this traditional understanding of punishment
at a time when the home secretary is inviting the probation service to move centre stage in the criminal justice system nacro it may seem misguided and unnecessarily pedantic to take issue with the white paper notion of punishment
punishment is just a word after all nothing more than convenient political rhetoric meriting only from probation manager and practitioner poised at the window of opportunity
however this fails to acknowledge a fundamental axiom of social work practice namely that language not only reflects but also shape social reality
a davy ha pointed out speech is the basic tool of the social worker
what we say influence what we think and in turn what we do
if punishment is assimilated into the probation glossary it will inevitably influence the sort of practice the service undertakes
in the section to follow the stark question is therefore put is the probation service in the business of inflicting pain and the answer which unfolds may be summarized no because it neither aspires nor wish to
the project more demanding than punishment
government concern about the problem of offending is a old a the probation service
indeed a bochel ha shown the establishment of a probation service in england and wale wa inextricably linked with work undertaken with offender in trouble through drink
almost a century later the new approach to punishment in the community outlined by the white paper once again present alcohol misuse a a key problem requiring intervention
alcohol the white paper state is implicated in a wide variety of crime drunken driving offence of public disorder and domestic violence para
in describing it vision of effective supervision the white paper go on to note
offender take part in alcohol education programme so that they can learn to drink sensibly
they learn about the relative strength of different drink the amount which is safe to consume and the pitfall to avoid competitive drinking and buying round para
a a summary of alcohol education programme this is something of a simplification
however it doe provide a useful introduction to the origin of the alcohol education course reported here
furthermore it highlight the suitability of referring to this type of project for testing out the appropriateness of applying the notion of punishment to probation practice
in the management of somerset probation service wa faced with the fact that nearly one in three of the offender supervised in their area were either known to be or suspected of misusing alcohol singer
aware of practitioner frustration in not being able to work effectively with these problematic client probation management in partnership with the voluntary sector determined to develop an alcohol education course aec
by when social inquiry report monitoring information covering offender indicated that the problem of offending wa virtually a great for a for client that is alcohol wa cited a a problem in per cent of case a specialist project worker had been appointed
towards the end of an aec wa launched and ha been running ever since
the aim of the course is to educate offender about alcohol to facilitate a lasting change in their subsequent use of this drug
this aim is underpinned by three interrelated objective and it is not without significance how they complement and serve to implement the white paper own trinity of aim of supervision that is protection of the public prevention of reoffending and successful reintegration of the offender in the community para
these were

to increase knowledge about alcohol so that future alcohol use can be more informed and therefore more prudent

to instil or reinforce responsible drinking attitude and behaviour

to encourage the maintenance of or where appropriate a reduction to a personally and socially safe level of alcohol unit intake
to meet these objective the aec ha a structured programme involving group and individual contact that is six group session sandwiched between interview held immediately before and after the group
the initial meeting held with one of the two group leader serf to clarify what participant can expect from the course and what is expected of them
a standard contract which cover condition of attendance and an agreement to complete various assignment between group session is signed by each participant
the final interview entail a personalized review of the course a well a the formulation of a plan to be undertaken with the offender supervising officer
the course employ a variety of material and technique including the use of checklist magazine and newspaper clipping quiz video brainstorm exercise discussion drink diary and role play menary
the aec is primarily intended for young adult subject to a probation order with a special condition of attendance schedule ii criminal justice act and reflects the fact that most somerset offender in trouble through drink commit serious offence posse a substantial number of previous conviction
in short they are seriously at risk of committing further offence and becoming trapped in the revolving door of custody
the development of the somerset aec both accord with and constitutes a practical example of the home office recent guidance to sentencers
in recent year the probation service ha devoted increasing resource to supervising the more serious and persistent offender
probation order which are combined with constructive disciplined and effective programme of supervision are increasingly being used for offender who stand to receive custodial sentence
from the description of the aec already given the demanding and disciplined nature of the course can be appreciated
however the course is not punitive it is not concerned with the infliction of pain
instead it is concerned with the establishment of rule
this is plainly evident from the section of the contract signed by each participant where what is expected of them is spelt out
you will be expected to keep a drink diary throughout the course and make attempt at reducing the amount you drink if it is greater than accepted healthy drinking level
you must be willing to be helped and help others your experience will be useful to other group member
you must attend session these will consist of an introductory session six group session and a final assessment interview
you must not drink before the session
you must be on time lateness will count a an absence
unlike the prison inmate aec participant can not sit back and passively do their time
probation practice is not however solely concerned with the establishment of rule
a ha been demonstrated elsewhere with regard to the generic probation setting singer the supervision of offender involves two overarching aim namely support and surveillance
support refers to anything which is said or done to help the offender solve or mitigate their personal or social problem surveillance to anything which is said or done to induce the offender to conform to socially acceptable standard of behaviour
these aim are implemented through the practice of four distinguishable but related method
in term of support there is counselling and assisting in term of surveillance there is directing and monitoring
each of these four method are employed during the eight session
although summarized a an alcohol education course the session are not just concerned with giving information but also with enabling participant to make practical use of it
in the first group session the counselling method is registered in the course tutor note menary by the explanation this session aim to get participant to consider the subject of alcohol in way they had not thought of in the past
during this session the importance of monitoring is also emphasized
drink exercise introduce the notion of measurement concentration of alcohol content information which will be necessary to carry out the recording of alcohol consumption throughout the duration of the course
in the fifth group session entitled focus on the individual the counselling and the monitoring combine with the directing and assisting method
at the start of the session the tutor note make clear that directing extends beyond enforcing the condition of attendance
this session allows for an in depth examination of the drinking diary over the last five week identifying the risky circumstance or situation
the aim at the end of the session is to encourage participant to make rule for their future drinking which will lead to a lessening of identified problem
similarly the assisting extends beyond simply providing handout of useful information
it is important that participant are provided with the skill to reduce their drinking level or handle more effectively pub centred problem
the use of role play incorporating previously discussed difficulty homework assignment session in real or set up situation provides an opportunity for testing these skill
probably the best illustration of the assisting method in action during the course come in the fifth session when somerset practitioner take the logic of working with the problem in the community to it ultimate conclusion
in the second half of the session course leader sponsor participant to an evening at the pub for the purpose of practising drinking skill and purchasing drink
the counselling assisting directing and monitoring on the aec give substance to the aim of support and surveillance and provide the basis for establishing a model of probation practice
punishment ha no place in this model
instead the aec can best be understood a an example of a paradigm of probation practice
twenty year ago the advisory council on the penal system observed that notion of punitiveness do not accord with the british concept of probation a an alternative to rather than a suspension of punishment quoted in bochel
twenty year later the aec demonstrates that this remains no le true now than it wa then
but doe the aec work
bringing fossil back to life
in this chapter some of the way in which palaeontologist determine the way fossil animal lived are described reanimating the dead fragment to build up a living creature
since popular idea of life in the past are often founded on vividly coloured reconstruction of the world in the jurassic period and the like it is important to remember that these imaginative scene are all inference from bone and similar fragment
in fact there is nothing fixed about such interpretation because the way the fossil are understood may change over the year but it is usually some time before new discovery percolate into the popular presentation
even the most dinosaur may have changed their habit in the last few year
many different line of evidence may be used to flesh out the bare bone of the fossil
the first of these is the evidence of the rock from which the remains were recovered
the sediment themselves reveal much about the environment of deposition a wa shown in chapter
it is important to establish whether the fossil animal actually lived in the environment which furnished it sedimentary cover or whether it remains were swept in from some other place
fortunately it is usually easy to spot such intruder
the type of sediment and the associated fossil will show whether the environment wa marine freshwater or terrestrial providing the basic information into which the ecology of the animal ha to be accommodated
the sediment themselves may have preserved some of the track left by the animal to give direct evidence of it past activity
from the track alone it is possible to be certain of the bipedal stance of certain dinosaur and to measure their stride
the character of the rock and their setting in the past geography at the time when they accumulated diagnosis the climatic setting in which the extinct fauna lived and climate imposes certain restraint on possible mode of life
savannah animal differ from those of tropical rain forest and these again from inhabitant of the tundra at high latitude
looking at the fossil animal itself the first necessity is to reconstruct it a accurately a possible from it fragmentary remains
sometimes this is a very complex business particularly for vertebrate with number of small bone
to proceed from the reconstruction to an assessment of probable life habit two different but complementary approach are used
one method attempt to compare the structure of teeth or limb or some other feature of the extinct animal with living analogue
these do not have to be biologically related organism
the basic argument is that structure that are closely similar were probably adapted to a similar function
sometimes these similarity are quite obvious the ferocious teeth of a predatory dinosaur are a sure indication of hunting habit with hardly a glance at the fang of living mammalian carnivore
but the structure and functioning of grinding or chewing teeth in other mammal in which opposing teeth in action and which can be matched in extinct unrelated mammal is a much more subtle matter involving detailed study on the operation of living dental system to help elucidate the functioning of fossil one
the technique of hunt the analogue is a favourite one practised by palaeontologist but it is certainly not a foolproof one because there are many fossil animal that defy comparison with living organism and some analogue do not stand up to detailed scrutiny
the second method try to analyse the structure of the fossil almost a if it were a piece of engineering
if the fossil is constructed in a certain way then there are only a limited number of job that the structure could perform
the idea here is to decide which of the possibility is the most likely one
this assumes that nature only manufacture efficient design
for the most part this is a reasonable assumption to make
most animal today do seem to have body that accord well with the function they have to carry out to survive flyer are aerodynamically efficient active swimmer have suitable streamlining herbivorous mammal have teeth appropriate for grinding plant food and so on
ideally one could construct a model of the fossil to test out these various function in experiment but the number of example where the analysis ha been pursued this far are limited
of course it can never be known whether the right answer ha been reached unless somebody dredge up a living fossil from the depth of the ocean there are only varying degree of probability
but the best answer are probably obtained where the functional design of the fossil point to the same life habit a a living analogue and where both are consistent with the geological circumstance in which the fossil remains occur
swimming trilobite
there are thousand of different kind of trilobite
all of them were marine and all of them are extinct
since many kind of trilobite at any one time they were probably occupying different ecological niche behaving in different way corresponding with the wide variation in shape that they show
we can use the method described above to elucidate some of these occupation and get a glimpse albeit an imperfect one of the trilobite a it lived
i will take an example where all the method can be used and where all point in the same direction so that the answer is probably correct
most trilobite were broadly being rather longer than wide not greatly convex and with eye that occupy perhaps a quarter of the length of the head
there are a few trilobite specie however with enormous globular eye see below
by examining the way these animal were put together it is possible to suggest a likely mode of life
ordovician trilobite seen from the top and side
twice it natural size
enlargement show a section through the lens to show the direction of the field of view
we can take the eye first
the trilobite eye wa of a compound type and each lens wa made up of a calcite crystal
from the optical property of this mineral we know that the lens wa able to interpret light coming from a direction more or le at to the lens surface
so we can deduce what the field of vision of our trilobite wa by looking at the direction in which all the lens face
it turn out that our animal wa able to see in almost every direction upwards downwards sideways and forward and even backwards because the eye bulged out beyond the line of the rest of the body
most other trilobite have a predominantly lateral field of view
if the animal lived on the sea bottom it seems unlikely that it would have eye lens specialized for looking downwards and we begin to suspect that the animal habitually dwelt above the sea floor
other feature of it shape are consistent with this
at edge of the eye are a pair of long spine and these point downwards at a steep angle at very awkward attitude for resting comfortably on the sea floor
most normal trilobite have a more or le horizontal rim around the forward margin which may have rested on the sediment surface
the thorax of the trilobite is remarkably long compared with the average trilobite compare fig
the convex middle part of the thorax contained the musculature that operated the appendage which a usual are not preserved and the relatively large volume of this region show that the musculature wa powerful
the construction of this trilobite suggests that it lived an actively swimming life well above the bottom and possibly in the surface water of the sea
of course because there are no living trilobite we can not find direct confirmation of this hypothesis but we can look for other arthropod that have the same modification of the eye for example in the present day ocean
the analogy is found in such amphipod a kind of shrimp a cystosoma which also ha enormously expanded eye looking like headlamp compared with it relative see above
in fact many of the arthropod that inhabit the water column have large globular eye of this kind

simple distinct veining can also be seen
the leaf is cm long
fossil flower porana oeningensis miocene
these beautifully preserved flower are from the oeningen deposit like the maple leaf and seed illustrated here
fossil flower are extremely rare because of their delicacy and because they are shortlived
these flower have five oval petal finely veined
no detail of the stamen are present in the fossil state
diameter of the flower is about cm
living crustacean cystosoma
if it is correct that our trilobite lived above the sea bottom actively swimming in the water there are certain prediction we can make about it geological occurrence which can be tested by looking in the rock
most trilobite preferred to live at a particular water depth or on a particular type of sea bottom mud sand or lime
no such restriction should apply to our specie it should be found with all other different kind of trilobite assemblage without preference
this ha been proved in several place in some arctic locality it is found with trilobite that lived at great depth in the mud of the ordovician ocean while in canada the same specie occurs mixed with the inhabitant of the sea where limestone were accumulating
by the same token the trilobite may be expected to have a very wide geographical distribution for ocean would be no barrier to it
and again this prof to be the case our example is found in arctic canada in the high arctic island of spitsbergen thousand of mile away in what is now the desert country of nevada and utah in the united state in western ireland in russia and in northwestern australia
so in this case the different source of evidence all point in the same direction whether derived from a detailed consideration of the way the trilobite is constructed or by analogy with living animal with similar adaptation or from the evidence of the rock or the distribution of the fossil
these trilobite of the ordovician were active swimmer in the surface water a near certainly a we can ever know
there are all kind of different question we can ask about the life habit of these trilobite which are not subject to the same kind of careful scrutiny
what did they eat for example
because we do not have the leg preserved it is not possible to see how the mouth appendage functioned in feeding and neither are the stomach content preserved
so here there are only more or le likely speculation
active swimmer in the surface water of the present ocean are likely to feed directly on the plankton and the trilobite may have had a method of harvesting large quantity of minute food
or they may have been hunter after larger prey in which case when appendage are eventually discovered they may prove to have adaptation for grasping and manipulating larger food
puzzle remain even though we can be certain of the rudiment of the story
controversy among the giant dinosaur
the giant sauropod dinosaur like brachiosaurus were the largest land animal the world ha seen they weighed more than tonne and present quite different problem in the interpretation of their life habit from the diminutive trilobite
such spectacular animal have obviously attracted much attention and one might suppose that the problem of how they lived would have been satisfactorily solved long ago
most of the popular book showing the mesozoic giant in their natural setting portray them wallowing about in swamp flanked by deep vegetation their body largely under water
surely an animal of this bulk it wa argued must be partly supported by water and their relatively inconsequential teeth must have been adapted for chewing on the kind of soft luxuriant vegetation that flourish in and around swamp
because their nasal opening were on the top of their head they could even continue to breathe if it became necessary see to totally submerge
recently the life habit of the giant have been looked at in a way that disproves most of these traditional notion
consider the structure of their leg
the sauropod have relatively long leg resembling those of the elephant the largest living land animal and may have been well adapted for supporting the huge bulk of the animal
the foot of the sauropod are small relatively speaking with short stubby toe yet animal that walk on soft mud tend to have spreading foot to distribute their weight more evenly
it is difficult to see how the compact foot of the sauropod could avoid becoming stuck fast in the soft muddy bottom of a lake
if the dinosaur did after all live on dry land then the long neck could have usefully functioned to allow the animal to browse the high foliage of tree see
it ha been suggested that an animal of the size of brachiosaurus could not have breathed under water because of the pressure on the lung
their fossil remains seem to occur with other animal and plant which are generally accepted a terrestrial
there is even some evidence from the track they have left behind that diplodocus and it ally moved about in herd
they may have been the gigantic reptilian analogue of the elephant and it may be no coincidence that the elephant also ha it nasal opening on top of the skull with the nostril in this case sited at the end of the trunk it ha been suggested that some sauropod may have had a proboscis of some sort
the balance of evidence seems to be swinging away from the original idea of giant dinosaur to fully terrestrial habit
but other aspect of the dinosaur living habit are still more strongly debated
in the last few year a powerful controversy ha arisen over whether the dinosaur a a whole were like all living reptile and there is no doubt that dinosaur were reptile or resembling mammal in this respect
animal have to warm up before they can be fully active that is why lizard and snake bask in the sun in temperate climate
for this reason they can not cope with climate having greatly extended winter
animal have the same body temperature at all time and can be more continuously active but they use far more energy and hence need more food than animal of the same size
the posture of many dinosaur and particularly the carnivorous theropod dinosaur wa fully erect with the leg beneath the body and unlike the sprawling leg of living reptile see
the long back leg of such hunter look highly suitable for running and a they did so the long tail may have been held erect a a kind of see
for any kind of prolonged activity would have been a distinct advantage
under the microscope even the bone structure of these dinosaur look more like that of living mammal than reptile
on the other hand it can be argued that the sauropod like brachiosaurus were so large and with a relatively small surface area through which to cool compared with their enormous volume that their cooling rate could have been slow enough to allow them to sustain more continuous activity than smaller living reptile
it ha also been argued that the small mouth of the giant simply could not have downed enough food to support a metabolism particularly plant food that need a lot of processing before it becomes available a energy
the armoured or plated dinosaur include some specie that seem too heavily burdened with protective armour to have been very active but this doe not necessarily mean that they had to be
protagonist of the theory will show some of the horned dinosaur charging over the cretaceous plain like furious reptilian rhinoceros
one idea about the life habit of the dinosaur giant published in joc and colette at the natural history museum in
the supporter tend to ally themselves with the supporter of a theory about the relationship of the dinosaur
this is that the dinosaur or a close dinosaur relative included the ancestor of the living bird
some of the smaller and most certainly highly active dinosaur were about the size of a chicken and there is more than a passing similarity between a running ostrich and the kind of reconstruction that show running dinosaur
the point is that bird themselves are like mammal and if bird and dinosaur are a closely related a now seems likely then it obviously increase the likelihood that the dinosaur themselves may have been
the pro and con of this theory are the subject of much contentious debate by expert but it would probably be correct to say that the greater number of specialist believe that at least the more bipedal of the dinosaur including small and large carnivore were active animal
a lot of the argument among the authority on these animal is about the equivalence or otherwise of certain bone in dinosaur and bird skeleton and particularly the jurassic bird archaeopteryx this make for rather dry reading for the layman
but the is the accurate reconstruction of the jurassic and cretaceous terrestrial world over which the dinosaur were indisputably dominant
action and inaction in the city
susanne macgregor and ben pimlott
the essay in this book do not amount to a programme but they are intended to provide a springboard for one
the aim is to analyse a problem which economic growth alone ha failed to cure and to consider possible new form of public action
the biggest single difficulty in drawing attention to urban poverty is that it is not new but simply in some of it most worrying manifestation getting worse
like the poor themselves the inner city ha long been with u
ever since the industrial revolution created a mass urban society the condition of the poorest city dweller have given rise to anxiety among the better off
the inner city ha been variously regarded a a cause for moral outrage a threat to public order or a a stain on the nation conscience
meanwhile bad housing bad sanitation lack of education and other perennial ill associated with overcrowding and poverty have been routinely denounced by political leader and social reformer
a central objective of the welfare state wa indeed to alleviate the problem of the urban poor over whom beveridge five giant want disease ignorance squalor and idleness had for so long held sway
in the early and the belief wa widely held that a combination of government intervention in the form of town planning housing and health programme and the provision of social security and permanent male full employment together with an increase in real wage would reduce suffering due to poverty to manageable proportion
the labour government wa elected on a tide of impatience at the slackening pace of social reform but also of optimism that little more than economic growth fuelled by technological change wa needed to remove the main cause of urban deprivation macgregor
disillusion swiftly followed
the work of peter townsend and others showed that far from presiding over the elimination of poverty the wilson government actually failed to prevent some of it feature from worsening townsend and bosanquet
evidence began to mount that much of the social welfare paternalism of the period had created almost a many problem a it solved
neither the butler education act of nor the introduction of comprehensive school prevented a high proportion of child from
reconstruction and housing programme seemed to do nothing to prevent and seemed even to encourage a rise in crime and mental illness
meanwhile in many part of the country a problem a old a city themselves tension between cultural group between earlier immigrant and newer one between black brown and white and increasingly between large section of urban youth and the police came to be identified a the key issue
rising unemployment turned a lingering and growing malaise into a crisis
a in the united state so in britain it wa an outbreak of violence that dramatically brought the plight of the inner city to public notice
in the early at a time when manufacturing industry wa collapsing and the outlook for the unskilled looked particularly bleak frustration boiled over in a series of riot in london bristol birmingham liverpool and elsewhere
all were spontaneous outburst none contrary to some claim were politically inspired or orchestrated except in northern ireland where urban problem existed on a grander more devastating scale and where there wa a unique heritage
many had an ethnic dimension in the sense that many of the rioter were black
unlike however the notting hill riot few of those involved were immigrant the vast majority were british born
and the disturbance could not strictly be called racial the most prominent feature wa that of violent clash between young people and the police
the problem however were not confined to violent upheaval of this kind
paul harrison inside the inner city life under the cutting edge focused on hackney a london borough ranked among the worst off on any scale of urban deprivation harrison
harrison describes the way in which the inner urban lead to a vicious circle with many victim but few individual villain
the police force face the virtually impossible task of keeping the lid on the explosive mixture of ingredient that the dynamic of british society have assembled in the inner city
this mixture heated by recession and high unemployment inevitably generates a high level of crime
this necessitates in turn a far more numerous and ubiquitous police presence than in other kind of area far more frequent unpleasant contact with the public a potential suspect and far greater opportunity for police misjudgment or abuse
the inevitable sufferer of course are the poor of whom those who actually commit the offence that concern the police are a tiny minority and whom indeed it should be the purpose of the police to protect
not only are the most disadvantaged on the receiving end of most crime argues harrison they also have to put up with the heaviest police presence
they are more likely to be stopped and searched and to be the victim of mistaken arrest or conviction
at the same time the resident of the poorest area have to suffer in a way that is not true of those who live elsewhere a growing fear of attack on themselves or their property
improved police method might help writes harrison to contain the problem
but without other change the result is likely to be a society of barricaded and a steady erosion of civil liberty
and he concludes of all the warning that the inner city ha to offer for the direction british society is taking this is perhaps the most sinister
harrison vision of a nightmarish future for inner city locked in a cold or hot war between and the force of public order wa echoed by robert chesshyre who concluded that by the late
the basic social contract whereby citizen enjoy certain right including health care decent education and housing and a job in return for which they observe the rule of law wa breaking down
a a consequence an underclass wa evolving football hooligan mugger inner city rioter somewhat more frightening than their dickensian forebear because they were mobile and all too visible

another wa the increased availability of and demand for cocaine
sensational medium and police report in seemed to suggest an increased use of crack among young people in part of south london liverpool and birmingham with attendant fear that this particularly dangerous substance might become widespread a it wa reported to be in part of the united state
for the moment however the pattern of drug abuse in britain remains a varied a ever with drug such a amphetamine a serious a problem a those that hit the headline
it is a symptom of public anxiety about urban squalor and le creditably of class and racial prejudice that drug and inner city are automatically linked in the popular consciousness macgregor
nevertheless and more particularly the disruptive social consequence of addiction are especially serious in area of city poverty burr
in short if life wa always harder in the inner city than elsewhere and if condition may temporarily have been alleviated by the impact of the welfare state and rising income the last decade ha been widely represented a a period of deterioration
moreover few would dispute that this apparent decline is a reality the first word of the prime minister herself after the result of the election wa known were an acknowledgement of the challenge posed to government by the inner city
what ha been lacking however a well a the political will to do something ha been any shared agreement on the cause

drawing on north american experience the commission concluded that poor management wa an important contributory factor to new york problem and sought to apply the same lesson here
the government initiative have to some extent reflected a diagnosis based on the need for better management though on the principle that central authority can provide a firmer grip than local one but combined with an belief in the restorative power of capitalism
leech and amin summarize this approach not unfairly in the following term
the encouragement of private investment and the liberation of the market the containment of the force of social discontent the control of the power of the local authority and the encouragement of the movement of the wealthy into the inner city thus creating buffer area of tory support accentuating inequality and injustice and hopefully though not necessarily reducing the potential for conflict among the urban poor
the main thrust of the government policy is contained in the january white paper on regional policy and the enterprise economy in the new employment training programme and especially in the march action for city programme all resting on wider reform to local government structure and finance and to education and housing
the most striking feature of this package apart from it aim actively to involve employer and entrepreneur is a sharp reduction in the role of local government
despite the contemporary tone of much of action for city the programme heritage can be traced to the early study which provided the basis for the holland report on housing and the plowden report on education a a result of which general improvement area and education priority area were established
the urban programme had a social rather than economic emphasis and wa administered by the home office
it wa initiated partly in response to the furore caused by enoch powell river of blood speech much a disturbance at the notting hill carnival prompted further step on the part of the department of the environment a riot make a much bigger impact on government thinking a donnison ha pointed out than any amount of earnest and accurate research
the urban programme consisted of grant and initiative under the local government grant social need act which wa intended a a flexible instrument to provide supplementary help to local authority in the field of housing education and health
originally the programme supplemented existing central and local government scheme designed to meet special need in urban area
the scope wa extended in an enhanced urban programme which included economic and environmental a well a social project and wa specifically directed at the inner urban area where the problem were most severe
earlier the change of emphasis from a social to an economic and environmental focus had been reflected in a switch of responsibility for the programme from the home office to the department of the environment
the enhanced programme resulted from the inner urban area act based on a white paper published the previous year on policy for the inner city doe the first comprehensive policy statement on the subject to acknowledge it a a definable and cohesive problem
the white paper drew on study conducted earlier in the decade in liverpool birmingham and london which pointed to a debilitating flight of capital and skilled labour from the critical area of deprivation
a key aspect of the white paper wa the stress it placed on the wider effect of poverty that it wa not just those with acute need who suffered
it argued that in talking about inner city it wa vital to think in term not just of individual but of society that the multiple deprivation of the worst hit area affected all the resident that the consequence included a pervasive sense of neglect and decay a decline in community spirit a low standard of neighbourhood facility and an increase in crime and vandalism and that without government intervention the future wa one of reduced job opportunity deteriorating housing and a decline in public service
the document and the legislation that derived from it pointed to a positively discriminatory approach with both central and local government supplementing existing programme in such a way a to strengthen local economy a well a the physical and social environment
such measure constituted the present government heritage when it took office in
none of them of course anticipated the scale of the problem which were caused by the slump and collapse of much of what remained of inner urban manufacturing industry in the early
neither at first did the incoming administration foresee the impact of rising unemployment which wa to be especially serious among the urban young
true the new secretary of state for the environment laid stress from the outset on the need for economic regeneration and indicated his sympathy for the voluntary sector in the tackling of urban problem
the previous government however had already pointed to the need to revitalize urban economy and at first the shift wa more rhetorical than real
michael heseltine ha since claimed that we set a new objective to make the inner city place where people would want to live and work and where the private investor would be willing to put his money
partnership became his slogan the partnership of public and private brain and money
a new urban development grant wa devised to with public fund scheme which would then attract private investment
heseltine vision wa of partnership which recognise that there are some thing that only government can pay for but also that the ingenuity and flexibility of the private sector is indispensable
he claim that serious work on policy began in but it wa undoubtedly the riot of coinciding with the biggest drop in employment and job vacancy since the war which gave impetus to the new approach
urban development corporation were introduced in in london docklands and merseyside and the urban development grant came in late the following year
conservative instinct were of course to minimize within the partnership state involvement and expenditure relative to that of private enterprise
yet the irony of the early a a deteriorating but perennial urban problem rapidly became the most acute aspect of the crisis of mass unemployment wa that a tory government found itself presiding over an increase in state intervention through a variety of agency
the increased scale of operation also ushered in another fashion of the new management structure
thus in city action team were introduced to each inner city partnership area to the work of the three government department involved
task force meanwhile were directed to tackle youth unemployment
by the urban programme wa supporting starter unit and business start in enterprise workshop
it wa providing training place often in conjunction with the manpower service commission some building were being improved estate action aimed to tackle run down housing and a large number of new partnership which some might see a subsidy or discredited regional grant in a new guise were in operation in an effort to bring private investment to urban area
by it wa claimed that million of urban development grant and urban regeneration grant had successfully levered more than million of private investment into the inner city although how much of the latter sum might have been invested in any case is difficult to say
meanwhile there were other incentive scheme enterprise zone for example and simplified planning zone which aimed to lift tax and planning barrier in order to facilitate investment
indeed while with one hand trying to hold down expenditure by local authority the government found itself by the late involved with the other hand in massive spending on inner urban area
the department of the environment alone by wa spending half a billion pound out of an action for city total involving most home department estimated at billion
perhaps a labour government would have spent even more it would certainly have spent it in different way
it is a curious comment on thatcherism however that the administration most committed to a reduction in the role of the state and in the need for an independent private sector ha spent more on specific urban regeneration and employment scheme and incentive to private investment in urban area than any other in recent history
one of the most bizarre aspect of government policy ha been the effective murder of the voluntary sector and it appropriation by subterfuge into the tory version of the corporate state
conservative have always lauded the voluntarist principle in welfare and encouraged it from platform
faced however with the catastrophic increase in unemployment and the need to occupy large number of workless people without directly employing them which would have run counter to the economic doctrine which had led to the redundancy of many of them in the first place the government poured money into any voluntary agency willing to put in a bid for cheap labour
one result wa the triumphant expansion of some charitable organization which rejoiced both at their importance and at the government munificence
another wa the transformation of many such body already heavily subsidized from public fund into de facto agency of the state which financed them and indirectly determined their policy
nowhere wa the impact of this clumsy sleight of hand more evident than in the inner city where voluntary organization had been most active and where the government wa most anxious for them to mop up unemployment
however the later withdrawal of government support with the scrapping of the community programme a unemployment receded left many of these voluntary organization high and dry
the national council for voluntary organization ncvo ha suggested from a recent survey that around project had been affected and had lost million in funding macgregor
there wa of course a crucial element in the government anxiety the high concentration of ethnic minority in the area of concern
in nearly per cent of ethnic minority in the uk lived in partnership or programme area
there is a danger in reading back from this figure another stereotype similar to the pavlovian drug city assumed link
some urban area have serious problem without a major ethnic dimension newcastle teesside not all member of ethnic minority are poor or deprived
nevertheless the high proportion of inner urban population composed of people from ethnic minority and the high incidence among these group of all the index of poverty and social and environmental hardship combined with the specific problem of rivalry harassment and tension make race and ethnicity an aspect that is central to any analysis of the inner city and of any ameliorative approach
making sense of the riot
reaction to the riot have concentrated on a number of key variable that are said to characterize the locality in which the riot have occurred
lord scarman report on the disorder highlighted the importance of unemployment urban deprivation racial disadvantage relation between young black and the police the decline of civic consent and political exclusion a the key issue
other reaction have concentrated on the issue of the interplay between decay and racial disadvantage in contemporary britain
yet others have argued that the unrest can be seen a a symptom of the breakdown of law and order in british society gaffney hall keith
the main issue that were prominent in debate during were race and law and order
this wa by no mean an accident since throughout the a powerful body of medium political and academic opinion had been constructed around the theme of how britain wa drifting into a violent society and how the basis of consent wa being shifted by the pressure of immigration and the growth of inner city area
a glimpse of the impact of the riot at this level can be achieved through two important debate in parliament
the first took place in the midst of the july riot and had a it theme civil disturbance
the tone of the debate wa set by home secretary william whitelaw introductory statement in which he spoke of a the need to remove the scourge of criminal violence from our street and b the urgency of developing policy designed to promote the mutual tolerance and understanding upon which the whole future of a free democratic society depends hansard vol july
the scourge of criminal violence wa whitelaw argued a danger to the whole framework of consent and legality on which the political institution of british society were based
in reply roy hattersley supported the call for the immediate suppression of street violence but warned that the root of such riot could not be dealt with until all people felt they had a stake in british society ibid col
the second debate took place on november on the publication of the scarman report and had a it theme law and order
the importance of the riot in pushing the law and order issue and specifically policing on to the main political agenda wa emphasized by the liberal leader david steel who argued that urgent action to prevent a drift into lawlessness wa necessary from both a moral and a political perspective hansard vol november col
a subsequent debate on the same issue in march wa also full of reference to the experience of the impact of street violence crime decaying urban condition the breakdown of consent between the police and many local community and the spectre of more violence to come if change in both policing tactic and social policy were not swiftly introduced hansard vol march col
the need to support the police wa accepted by both the labour and the conservative speaker in the parliamentary debate on the riot and wa established a a benchmark for the official response to the riot long before the scarman report wa published in november
any substantive disagreement centred around the issue of what role social deprivation and unemployment had in bringing young people to protest violently on the street
intermingled with the discourse about race and law and order were constant reference to unemployment particularly among the young and various form of social disadvantage and poverty solomos pp
throughout and debate about the riot in the medium in parliament and in various official report hinged around the interrelationship between racial and social factor
the importance of this debate can be explained partly by the political capital which the opposition could make from linking the social and economic malaise of the country at large with violent street disturbance
conversely throughout this period government minister strenuously denied that unemployment and social deprivation were significant cause of urban unrest
although the scarman report is often taken to be the central text which argues for a link between social condition and disorder the term of the debate were by no mean set by scarman
during both april and july vigorous exchange took place in the press and in parliament about the role that deteriorating social condition and unemployment may have played in bringing about the riot
during the july parliamentary debate on civil disturbance roy hattersley formulation of this linkage provided a useful summary of the social condition argument
after some preliminary remark about the labour party support for the police he went on to outline his opposition to the view of the riot a essentially outburst
i repeat that l do not believe that the principal cause of last week riot wa the conduct of the police
it wa the condition of deprivation and despair in the decaying area of our old city area in which the brixton and toxteth riot took place and area from which the skinhead invader of southall come
hansard vol july
much of the subsequent controversy about this analysis centred on the question of youth unemployment
hattersley had suggested that the riot were a direct product of high level of youth unemployment and a furious debate ensued in both parliament and the medium about this assertion
the final symbolic cue used to make sense of the protest is more difficult to categorize but it basic meaning can be captured by the term political marginality
while a number of discussion of the root of urban unrest in the united state have noted the salience of political marginality in determining participation in violent protest skolnick fogelson edelman knopf this issue ha received relatively little attention in britain
nevertheless during the event and their aftermath the political context wa discussed from a number of perspective
the scarman report for example located part of the explanation for the riot in the feeling of alienation and powerlessness which were experienced by young black living in depressed area
a successful policy for tackling the root of urban disorder wa seen a one which sought to involve all the community in dealing with the problem of each area so that they could come to feel that they have a stake in it future scarman para
where such argument did not fit in with the overarching theme of race violence and disorder and social deprivation they were either sidelined or pushed into the of official report
the scarman report for example contained the following policy proposal i recommend that local community must be fully and effectively involved in planning in the provision of local service and in the management and financing of specific project scarman para
such a move towards greater political integration wa seen by lord scarman a essential if the gap between resident and the force of law and order wa to be bridged
but the concern with overcoming political marginality remained on the sideline of the main public debate because it questioned the perception of the rioter a driven by irrational uncivilized and criminal instinct
this did not however stop the question of political marginality and the need to reform existing policy from being raised at all a can be seen subsequently by the attempt after to introduce both locally and nationally measure which were meant to address some of the grievance of the rioter and to ensure that further disturbance did not occur
aspect of these measure are considered further on in the chapter
perspective on the riot
despite widespread prediction of further unrest in the aftermath of the scale and the location of the riot seem to have surprised even some of the most astute commentator
handsworth for example wa presented even shortly before september a a success story in term of police community relation
the outbreak of violence in this area wa therefore widely presented a an aberration
similarly the spread of violence in london to area such a the broadwater farm estate in tottenham wa seen a a break from previous experience which had centred on area such a brixton
there are many continuity between and in relation to the image used in the press and television to cover the event
but response in were different at least in term of degree and probably in relation to the extent to which the riot were seen a a race phenomenon by a wider body of opinion
the ambiguity and to be found in much of the press coverage during had at least acted a a countervailing tendency against the more extreme form of discourse which blamed the riot completely on black people
during the riot and their immediate aftermath the imagery of race wa used by section of the press without the sense of ambiguity which could still be found in
the silence over race wa breached in but in debate about racial issue wa taken a step further
peregrine worsthorne for example used the ferocity of the confrontation in handsworth brixton and tottenham to argue that there wa a major question mark over the possibility of assimilating the coloured population into mainstream british value sunday telegraph september
to be sure there wa still a strong response opposing enoch powell call for repatriation from all shade of political opinion but the racialization of public debate about the riot went much further than
in this context it wa the externality of british and asian which wa highlighted rather the racist institution and process which worked against black at all level of society
the usage of race during the period took on new meaning which had little if anything to do with the impact of racism a such since the emphasis wa on the cultural characteristic of the minority community themselves
after handsworth part of the press response wa to blame the riot on rivalry between west indian and asian and even after the argument were criticized by local resident and community leader they were used to explain what happened
in addition the question whether the culture and value of the black community their family structure and their political attitude bred violence wa constantly raised van dijk
the actual fact of who wa arrested during the riot whether black or white were hardly debated since it wa assumed that they were mostly black and mostly unemployed and involved with crime keith
the imagery of the black bomber used in handsworth wa extended to the notion that there were group of alienated and criminalized young black who saw the riot a a chance to engage in an orgy of looting
the dear report on handsworth capture this image and link it to the social condition of young black
the majority of rioter who took part in these unhappy event were young black and origin
let there be no doubt these young criminal are not in any way representative of the vast majority of the community whose life ha contributed to the life and culture of the west midland over many year and whose hope and aspiration are at one with those of every other citizen
we share a common sorrow
it is the duty of u all to ensure that an entire cultural group is not tainted by the action of a criminal minority
dear
this black criminal minority wa constructed not only into the leading force behind the riot but sometimes a the only force
indeed throughout september and october and during the following month the imagery of race continued to dominate debate about both the cause and the policy outcome of the riot
a pointed out earlier the social cause argument wa another major plank of public debate about the riot particularly in relation to the highly politicized issue of unemployment
during this issue wa raised once again though by then the extent of mass unemployment and urban and decay wa more stark than it had been in
image of urban decay tinderbox city and ghetto street linked up with the image of race inequality and black ghetto to produce an analysis more complex but also more contradictory
an interesting mixture of the various image wa provided by a story in the daily telegraph under the headline broadwater farm like the divis flat with reggae october
the mirror described the estate a living hell and quoted one resident a saying that you no idea how awful daily life is october
such image were reworkings of argument already used about toxteth in and brixton in but they were used more widely than in
even the daily mail which deployed the clearest use of race and outside agitator argument ran a major story on broadwater farm under the headline hulk litter this concrete jungle despair hang heavy october
a number of story using such imagery were run by both the quality and the popular press during this period but similar argument are to be found in parliamentary debate hansard vol october col and even in official report produced by the police on the riot in birmingham and london
the city of inner despair were conceived a the breeding ground for disorderly protest and however hard the government tried to break the causal link between the two it wa forced to take on board the need to restore order not only through the police but through promise of help for the inner city
much a in the social cause argument can not be seen separately from the broader debate about the future of the british economy and society
the government record on unemployment wa a heavily politicized issue and just a in it vehemently denied any responsibility for the riot through it pursuit of policy
but the government did find a way of accepting a link between the riot and social problem without bringing it main policy into the debate namely by linking the growth of violent disorder to crime and drug
the emphasis on crime and the criminal act of the rioter in the official response to the riot took a general and a specific form
the general form relied on the argument that the riot were not a form of protest against the insufferable social condition of area or the action of the police but a criminal act or a cry for loot
this wa an argument put most succinctly by geoffrey dear chief constable of the west midland dear and by douglas hurd the home secretary in relation to handsworth
but it recurred a a theme in official and press response to the other riot
the specific form wa built upon the notion that the outbreak of violence in handsworth and brixton in particular wa brought about by drug baron who saw the police attempting to curb their activity and control their territory
numerous example of this line of argument can be found in dear report on handsworth and in press coverage during the riot
taking the specific argument about the role of drug and drug baron in stimulating the riot this seems to have served two purpose
first it distanced the riot from the social economic political and other grievance which had been linked to them by locating the cause outside the social problem of dweller and in the simple greed of the drug baron to accumulate loot
second just a dear image of a few hundred young black criminal wa used to explain what happened in handsworth the problem of drug wa used to explain what happened at a national level
the issue of drug provided an everyday image already a national issue through saturation medium coverage and public debate around which the police the home office and other institution could depoliticize the riot
responding to the handsworth event douglas hurd wa moved to argue forcibly that such event were senseless and reflected more on those who participated in them than on the society in which they took place the sound which law abiding people in handsworth heard on monday night the echo of which i picked up on tuesday wa not a cry for help but a cry for loot financial time september
the chief constable for the west midland geoffrey dear took this argument further by pointing out that the day before the riot a successful carnival had taken place with the support of local community leader
he drew the conclusion from this that the riot came like a bolt out of the blue guardian november
such language focused attention on the individual or group who were breaking the law committing criminal act and threatening the interest of the majority
potential application
overview
ian masser
given the extent to which geographic information management is application driven it is important to consider in some depth the characteristic of some potential application field
in the process it will be necessary to examine not only the extent to which geographic issue feature on the policy issue agenda in these field but also the institutional context which governs and the extent to which data are available for research and policy analysis purpose
question on data availability are likely to be particularly important where user are heavily dependent on secondary source
in situation of this kind provision governing access and format may exert powerful constraint on the use that can be made of these data
the first four chapter in this part examine issue relating to geographic information handling in term of four potential application field
the author were asked to review the current state of the art in their field with particular reference to the likely requirement of the future policy issue agenda in term of the demand that they make on geographic information management
author were also asked to evaluate critically the state of geographic information provision in term of the need of user and to consider the impact of user requirement on the development of geographic information handling methodology
in this way the chapter in this part present a number of perspective which essentially complement and amplify the discussion in the previous part
in this case however methodological issue are tackled from a largely user standpoint whereas in the previous part they were viewed a substantive problem in their own right
in effect the product of the discussion in both part is a matrix where the methodological issue are listed along one axis and particular application field on the other
figure summarizes the main feature of this matrix
there are important difference between the chapter in this part both in the nature of the demand that they make on geographic information and also in the relative importance that is attached to geographic criterion a against other issue by planner and in these field
the first three chapter dealing with environmental monitoring natural and technological hazard and settlement and infrastructure application make use of a very wide range of geographic information
a major feature of these application is the extent to which they involve overlay of a variety of information drawn from different source on a topographic map base
for this reason they make particularly heavy demand on current gi technology both because of the size of the data set and the diversity of the data structure that are involved
brown chapter on geodemographics discus an application field where primary data collected for operational purpose are typically evaluated in relation to secondary data derived from source such a the census of population
the range of data set involved and the demand that are made on gi technology in application of this kind are often more limited than those of previous application field
however this is offset by the demand that are made on spatial analysis and modelling methodology
rhind chapter on environmental monitoring and prediction discus the role of geographic information management in promoting sustainable development on a global scale in the context of the issue identified in the brundtland report
it point to the impact that the finding of global environmental research are likely to have on most sector of the uk economy
this contribution also indicates the wide variety of group that are involved in monitoring environmental change and draw attention to the role that the european community is increasingly playing in these effort
one of the example of work in progress discus research that ha been carried out for the european commission a part of the corine project
this highlight the challenge for research in a field categorized by a lack of data for some country varying definition and standard in use and unreasonably high user expectation
the chapter a a whole draw attention to a number of key methodological issue that are involved in environmental monitoring and prediction
these include the highly specialized nature of much of the technical analysis the limited capacity for checking the accuracy of many of the finding of this kind of research and the consequent need for the development of inference machine for extracting useful information from secondary and often proxy data
in chapter gatrell and vincent consider a wide range of natural and technological hazard including industrial hazard risk assessment hazardous waste disposal emergency planning natural hazard and environmental epidemiology
the substantive content of much of this research straddle the social environmental and mathematical science
to model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas generated by a chemical explosion and it impact on the surrounding area for example an understanding of atmospheric dispersion model epidemiology and population distribution would be required
in application of this kind the author argue that geographic information management in general and gi in particular have an important role to play and they give a number of example from research in progress to illustrate the current state of the art in this field
the discussion of operational problem and prospect further amplifies many of the issue raised in preceding chapter particularly with respect to the problem caused by the dependency on secondary data source and the need for much more detailed geographic information to overcome some of the problem associated with linking data set
like most of the other contributor to this section gatrell and vincent see decision support system a a major area for future development in the geographic information management field
given that most gi are rather dumb system requiring intelligent very computer literate user managing natural and technological hazard mean that this knowledge base must be built into the system so that it can be utilized quickly by untrained user after a disaster ha taken place or in an emergency
the settlement and infrastructure field is also characterized by a wide range of user with a great diversity of interest
these include not only central and local government but also major utility company and transport supplier
according to shepherd these user share a common need for information on the amount capacity and condition of urban land transport network utility hospital school and other major communal facility
in addition to these data requirement such user are also interested in developing their capability for modelling the changing relationship between the supply and demand for infrastructure in the context of both public and private sector
shepherd more than any other contributor to this section draw attention to the extent to which current effort in the geographic information management field are constrained by the highly fragmented nature of both data supplier and user both in sectoral and spatial term the great diversity of data set in varying format and the difficulty presented by institutional factor such a copyright provision data ownership and the control of access to data
digital data occupy a central position in this application field and a number of example are given to illustrate the extent to which their development ha been hampered or facilitated in various country by the policy of the organization with responsibility for digital data provision
in chapter brown review the development of geodemographics from it origin in the social area analysis of u census tract data from onwards
he describes the feature of the four main system that are currently in use in the uk and illustrates their application with reference to example drawn from retail analysis and store location market research credit rating and target marketing
brown demonstrates the extent to which the growth of research activity in this field ha led to the emergence of improved cluster analytic method for the multidimensional classification of people according to the type of area in which they live
in the last part of this contribution brown identifies a number of priority for future research
like gatrell and vincent and shepherd before him he is concerned with the lack of detailed geographical information particularly in this case with reference to the year between census
spatial linkage also feature prominently in brown discussion which amplifies many of the point made in the earlier contribution from openshaw in chapter
the analysis point to the need for the development of a fuzzy geodemographics methodology which take account of the effect of different type of spatial error
other major research priority for the future in this application field are the development of technique to explore the factor affecting consumer choice
this is particularly important in a field where many of the demand made by user are highly specialized in nature
in summary then a fig show many of the issue raised by this review of geographic information handling in the four potential application field are essentially complementary to those discussed in the part on methodological development
spatial analysis feature particularly prominent on the research agenda relating to natural and technological hazard and geodemographics
question relating to data integration emerge a being particularly critical in term of environmental monitoring and settlement and infrastructure application
spatial linkage and question relating to spatial representation feature prominently in the settlement and infrastructure and geodemographics field
the evaluation of error propagation is a matter of considerable significance in the environmental monitoring and settlement and infrastructure field
finally in all application field the finding of the review above suggest that there is a need for improvement in user interface of all kind
this is particularly evident in the demand for the development of decision support system and modelling capability
such demand highlight the extent to which geographic information management must be regarded a a mean to an end rather than an end in itself when viewed from the standpoint of the need of planner and
the final chapter in this section round off the discussion of research with an examination of organizational issue that need to be taken account of in handling geographic information
campbell present a conceptual framework for the analysis of the organizational issue involved in the development and implementation of gi
this contribution cut across many of the question relating to particular application that were raised in preceding chapter and draw attention to the danger of neglecting institutional and personal consideration in practice
all too often a the experience of many mature application indicates technical and matter dominate the system development phase and technically elegant solution are devised which fail to take enough account of user need and capability

environmental monitoring and prediction
david rhind
introduction
monitoring of the state of and the change in the environment is now universally recognized a being of profound importance to mankind tickell
this awareness is most obviously manifested by the frequent appearance of press report on ozone depletion on the greenhouse effect and possible global warming on nitrate pollution on deforestation in the tropic on decreasing biological diversity and on many other environmentally related topic
usually these report concentrate on prophecy of a forthcoming armageddon but many also describe a dire contemporary situation
thus the algal bloom off the italian adriatic shore in is reckoned to have caused the holiday trade and local fisherman loss running into ten if not hundred of million of pound
more globally the brundtland report wced noted that in the day during which the world commission wa at work

the african drought put the life of million people at risk and may have killed million of them

the bhopal accident killed and injured more

the chernobyl disaster caused environmental damage across europe

a chemical fire in switzerland caused toxic material to be transported by the rhine at least a far a the netherlands

at least million people died of diarrhoeal disease caused by malnutrition and dirty water
a a consequence of these and other disaster of rapid and broadcasting of them and of the concerned action of many individual the environment is now moving fast up the political agenda patten
the then prime minister also emphasized the political awakening to the environment in statement such a it is possible that with all these enormous change population agricultural use of fossil fuel concentrated into such a short period of time we have unwittingly begun a massive experiment with the system of this planet itself thatcher
the political concern is not altruistic
mr thatcher a recent convert to environmental conservation clearly held the opinion that environmental problem are not only soluble but that solving them can be shown to be
in the past when we identified form of pollution we have shown our capacity to act effectively
the great london smog are now only a nightmare of the past
we have cut airborne lead by per cent
we are spending billion on cleansing the mersey basin alone and the thames now ha the cleanest metropolitan estuary in the world
even though this kind of action may cost a lot i believe it to be money well and necessarily spent because the health of our economy and the health of our environment are totally dependent upon each other
the government espouses the concept of sustainable economic development
stable prosperity can be achieved throughout the world provided the environment is nurtured and safeguarded thatcher
the primary official manifestation of this uk commitment to the environment ha been the government white paper hmso
while criticized by many on the ground that it had few teeth and represented a compromise between the doe and all other department notably those of agriculture and of transport it wa none the le a major achievement
it main section dealt with the government approach to the environment nationally at the european level and globally the nature and effect of the greenhouse effect environmental problem in both rural and urban area especially in relation to matter pollution control and enhancing awareness of environmental matter
central to this approach is said to be an emphasis upon guidance from the best available scientific evidence
there is also a clear recognition of the need for monitoring and modelling of the state of the natural and environment
though there ha been a change of prime minister and of the secretary of state for the environment since the publication of the white paper the environmental cause seems a strong a ever
thus the time of december reported that a group of of the most senior civil servant had met the previous weekend to discus way in which the government machine could respond better to national and international problem such a the threat of global climate change
pearce et al have argued that the effect of government commercial and other action on the environment can and should be assessed on a basis and this seems likely to be the basis on which at least the uk government will proceed
given such a lead it is scarcely surprising that british scientist have sought to demonstrate the practical and financial consequence of environmental event and process table for example illustrates their perception of the importance of global environmental research to the uk domestic economy
if it now seems that monitoring of the global environment is necessary indeed is even vital the prediction of what is likely to happen is almost a important the people in the maldives are understandably worried about the prospect of global change since no part of the island is more than m above present
yet a we shall see below the prediction of the activity of natural and environmental system requires an understanding of the interaction of process that in many case we simply do not yet have
even monitoring of the present is very imperfect a witness the order of magnitude variation in estimate now current for deforestation rate
this chapter then attempt to review some of the problem in environmental monitoring and prediction describes some of the relevant scientific and organizational activity and look ahead to what is likely to happen next
the nature of environmental process
notwithstanding mr thatcher confidence that we can fix environmental problem the difficulty associated with a task even a apparently simple a monitoring a state variable are considerable
some of the reason for this the difficulty of deciding on appropriate proxy variable and on economical yet temporal and spatial sampling framework taking account of the relative importance of aperiodic and rare event a compared to process processing the vast volume of data usually involved and organizing the multidisciplinary and often multinational researcher involved are discussed briefly later
even at this stage however it is important to stress that we have a very incomplete understanding of many process in the natural environment
the next section therefore attempt to summarize what we do know it is derived chiefly from the earth system science committee essc
temporal and spatial scale of operation
even ignoring the effect of man earth system process operate at a variety of spatial and temporal scale see fig see also rosswall et al
thus microclimate effect can have major implication for local population such a those brought about by the photochemical smog of los angeles are often applicable only over area of a few hectare or le and may operate on a diurnal cycle
in contrast soil creation cf soil degradation may require hundred or thousand of year
in between are variation in phenomenon such a el nino
the sampling theorem indicates that we must sample these phenomenon at a frequency of no le than half their wavelength if we are to avoid bias in measurement
in this chapter the primary concern is with change occurring over time span from minute to century and from spatial wavelength from about m to about km
it is however impossible to separate out process acting at different scale and over different period a single volcanic eruption lasting hour or day sometimes lead to dust and gas being ejected into the atmosphere over a period of month and this in turn may lead to global climatic fluctuation over year or decade
conversely a and phenomenon such a the movement of tectonic plate can lead to local stress accumulation and to it release by an earthquake in a few second and with highly local effect
this therefore ha the following consequence

we should know something about the periodicity of the variable we are monitoring if we are not to risk either unnecessarily detailed data collection or aliasing of trend

since we know that the periodicity of some variable is longer than the monitoring already carried out by human being we must make use of surrogate or proxy variable to extend our range of knowledge such a via tree ring palynology oxygen isotope ratio from ice core and geomorphological evidence of environmental change

since we are not yet able to predict all the interaction which may be important in a study of environmental problem collecting potentially useful data a well a those believed central to the problem under study is often wise

we must accept that most data collection exercise will inevitably be a compromise on the ground of cost and hence le than perfect data set will be produced

irrespective of the use of surrogate monitoring environmental process only make sense over which are extended by human standard hence the igbp see below is designed to run for two or three decade

change in political priority may simply result in the need for informed guesswork if suitable data are not available
much attention will be given throughout this chapter to monitoring the environment on a global basis
this is not merely because of it topical nature
the main reason is that though some problem are local and are best studied that way many others even involving a limited geographical extent are best understood within a global framework
thus no meteorologist would attempt to forecast the weather or day ahead without using a mathematical model based on observation from all around the world
moreover recent work ha shown that much of the heat energy in the sea of the north atlantic every square kilometre of which give off a much energy a a nuclear power station and hence influence our weather is absorbed from sunlight in the tropical pacific and is carried by ocean current through the drake passage and up into the atlantic
thus to understand some local and many regional national and continental and all global environmental event we need to have a global perspective and hold global database rhind and mounsey mounsey and tomlinson
in no way however doe this invalidate the need for microscale study for instance while global data set may indicate the extent of algal bloom and may suggest cause of them only detailed study of the algae themselves can provide understanding of why the bloom is occurring
the process themselves
a major complication however is that the environment can rarely be treated a in a laboratory experiment
given this determining the nature of the interaction between the variable becomes a matter of major difficulty
figure is taken from essc and is an attempt to show the interaction between environmental process a well a the indicator and implication of change in the state of the environment
in essence the figure can be summarized a showing process within the physical climate system and within the biogeochemical one these system being interwoven by the global role of water and increasingly affected by human activity
the main component of the first system are well known the atmosphere is it engine and atmospheric circulation is driven by difference in solar heating between the equatorial and polar region
we are however becoming ever more aware of the massive influence of ocean on our climate research into interaction is now a priority
in ocean dynamic study important topic are heat storage circulation and the role of sea ice
atmospheric circulation and in turn precipitation and temperature is also greatly affected by the balance of thermal energy at the land surface itself affected by the vegetation and terrain characteristic
the biogeochemical system embrace the totality of the movement of the key element essential to life carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorus and others through what ha been described a the total earth system
the ocean and their biota play a central role in the carbon and nutrient cycle global ocean circulation is also critical to the global carbon budget
trace gas in the atmosphere are key component of the cycle of such element a carbon nitrogen oxygen sulphur and the halogen a is now well known their concentration are much influenced by biogenic and anthropogenic activity and the concentration of such gas a carbon dioxide ozone methane nitrous oxide and the chlorofluoromethanes cfms strongly affect radiative transfer and provide a link with the physical climate system
a particular cause for concern is that the concentration of the two main cfms is increasing by about per cent per annum while the equivalent figure for methane nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are and per cent
finally the chemistry of the stratosphere is dominated by the photochemical production and catalytic destruction of ozone
there are several important way in which biogeochemical process can influence climate and hence habitability except where the latter is maintained at enormous cost
if for instance the concentration of certain trace gas see above continue to increase it ha been predicted that the earth surface temperature will increase by an amount comparable to that since the last major phase of the most recent glaciation about year bp though there is some dispute about the magnitude of the likely change
the converse case the effect of physical climate change on biogeochemical process is also of obvious importance change in annual average and cycle of temperature and precipitation together with the probability of extreme event such a prolonged drought or frost are major determinant of terrestrial ecosystem type at least in area largely unaffected by human activity
change to the environment have increased rapidly a a consequence of growing population number and of numerous development in technology
fossil fuel combustion for instance ha led to increased concentration of sulphate in precipitation acid rain and many river lake and estuary have been greatly affected by phosphate from agricultural urban or industrial source
it should be stressed however that while the outline of human activity are clear there are still many uncertainty for instance we know that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide ha risen about per cent since
but calculation of the total carbon released by fossil fuel combustion imply that if all such carbon remained in the atmosphere the concentration would have increased by twice a much
the absolute difference between the two figure seems to be due to two different factor absorption by the ocean and other reduction in carbon stock in living biota the latter being strongly affected by human activity since the industrial revolution
doe god play dice
much environmental prediction is predicated upon a logical positivist or newtonian deterministic basis
the environmental system are effectively regarded a machine whose working can all be discovered described in differential equation form and whose future activity can thus be predicted in detail if their initial state are known
an argument by many atmospheric physicist for example is that shortcoming in the accuracy of weather prediction over period of more than a few day largely result from the unsophisticated nature of existing model the lack of suitable data and inadequate computer power see fig derived from tyler
in contrast the advocate of chaos theory stewart argue that some natural system are so sensitive to tiny stimulus that even the faint beat of a butterfly wing could be the ultimate trigger for a hurricane
in essence they argue that tiny difference in the initial condition of many system can lead to widely different outcome since the system exhibit stochastic behaviour within a deterministic framework
if so there is little chance of making accurate forecast of these system
this ha been recognized by among others essc
the author of that report accepted that there is a theoretical limit of week in explicit prediction of fluctuation in weather because of the influence of turbulence within the dynamic such limit imply that medium and prediction must inevitably be stochastic
to complicate matter still further however it seems at least possible that the component of the earth system may best be predicted deterministically at some spatial and temporal scale but stochastically at others and that the basis of prediction will differ for different component
a an example atmospheric temperature show marked variability a strong seasonal cycle with some variation a weak minimum variability for year average and then increased variation again at longer essc
it need hardly be pointed out that coping with such multiple database on which modelling is to be carried out is not a trivial exercise
finally it is perhaps worth concluding this section by emphasizing that there is still much controversy among the scientific community about the magnitude of many of the effect being discussed
in general the research work of the international group of scientist including those involved in the committee and in the uk committee on global environmental change ha progressively reduced the magnitude of the predicted effect of for example global warming
in giving the robens coal science lecture at the royal institution sir john mason a former director of the meteorological office urged caution in interpreting the result of the massive atmospheric and oceanic modelling exercise a the equilibrium model are refined to take account of the thermal lag in ocean etc lower value of predicted change are likely
thus while almost all scientist are at the time of writing convinced from the evidence that change in climate is under way and that regional effect may be much greater than the global average the magnitude of the latter is now thought likely to be about half of what wa predicted only year ago
who is involved and what is going on
if we consider the environment in the broadest sense much monitoring of it ha been in progress for many year and by an enormous diversity of organization in the uk these include the doe the forestry commission the nature conservancy the health and safety executive local authority the component member of the natural environment research council such a the institute of terrestrial ecology and the british antarctic survey individual or research group in academia the cegb the friend of the earth and uk centre for economic and environmental development ceed
the diversity of monitoring organization seems just a great in other country numerous multinational organization both the un environment programme unep and the international union for the conservation of nature iucn and the international institute for environment and development iied are also active in the field
moreover commercial monitoring of the environment is now also routine notably to predict crop yield in the main area and hence facilitate the buying of future
the international scientific involvement
scientist have both promoted and responded to the increasing interest in the environment
thus at the global scale the international council of scientific union icsu ha endorsed the setting up of the international geosphere biosphere project igbp to describe and understand the interactive physical chemical and biological process that regulate the total earth system the unique environment it provides for life the change that are occurring in that system and the manner by which these change are influenced by human action report of ad hoc planning group for igbp quoted in igbp
priority in the igbp is intended to be given to those area which deal with key interaction and significant change on the of decade to century that most affect the biosphere that are most susceptible to human perturbation and those that will most likely lead to a practical predictive capability for global change
this is to be put into operation by concentrating on four theme

documenting and predicting global change

observing and improving our understanding of dominant forcing function

improving our understanding of interactive phenomenon in the total earth system

assessing those effect of global change which will be large scale and cause major modification to both renewable and resource
by igbp had progressed a far a defining a set of seven core project igbp addressing these four theme
in addition plan for regional research centre and for the data and information system for igbp known a had been announced
the latter are particularly relevant to this chapter
based in paris and working under professor rasool it is intended to concentrate on managerial and policy aspect of the task in the first year but then to expand considerably thereafter
task agreed for the include making available a directory of data directory modelled on nasa master directory providing data set for education and training and undertaking a land cover pilot study
until remarkably little interaction had taken place between the hard science and the social science community on global monitoring and prediction
it is noteworthy however that the royal society made a plea for just this type of multidisciplinary work in it submission on greenhouse gas to the house of lord select committee on science and technology royal society
fortunately in addition to the action of the world hard science community a parallel effort is now being initiated by social scientist fuchs jacobson and price
currently this is organized and sponsored by the international social science council issc the un university and the international federation of institute of advanced study
it objective are to

improve scientific understanding and increase awareness of the complex dynamic governing human interaction with the total earth system

study explore and anticipate social change affecting the global environment

identify broad social strategy to prevent or mitigate undesirable impact of global change or to adapt to change which are unavoidable

analyse policy option for dealing with global environmental change and promoting the goal of sustainable development
jacobson and price provide a useful summary of the way in which human factor contribute to and are affected by likely global change in particular they stress the importance of the issue and the role of gi in coping with some of the problem of data integration and manipulation
the issc proposed it own work programme in the human dimension of global change in late
while these organization intrinsically have a membership and are concerned with research into global environmental change others share the same interest but from a more restricted geographical base
a leading example of this is the european science foundation which ha sponsored research programme in both the physical and social science aspect of environmental change esf
governmental and political involvement
the spread of environmental awareness is readily demonstrated in country had environmental and natural resource management agency whereas a decade later the number wa wec
in most country the governmental and political concern with the environment ha come somewhat later than that of scientist or concerned lay people the early development of the green party in the federal republic of germany is something of an exception
such a commitment to the environment is none the le both welcome and necessary if resource are to be made available to tackle existing let alone forthcoming environmental problem
the conversion of the uk government ha been briefly described earlier it is manifested in their july commitment to spend on climate change research in and the confident request to them from the advisory board for the research council abrc for an extra in and in the two succeeding year for additional environmental research
perhaps the most significant development of all however is the increasing role of the european commission
their role in bringing environmental impact assessment eia on to the statute book is well known but the commission ha now made a proposal cec for the establishment of the european environment agency and the european environment monitoring and information network
the commission argues that there is at present no monitoring of environmental quality and trend on a european scale nor any guarantee that the result of environmental monitoring will be comparable on a basis a realization brought about through the corine programme described later
the objective of the new agency would be to assist the community and the member state to achieve the goal set out in the treaty of rome and in successive environmental action programme it must also however be seen in the context of the european council adoption on december of the rhodes declaration on the environment and the environment chapter in the single european act which come into effect in
the detailed specific role of the system comprising both agency and network are envisaged a

to provide the community the member state and participating third country with the objective sic information requested for the formulation and implementation of sound and effective environmental policy

in particular to provide technical scientific and economic information requested by the commission in it task of identification preparation and assessment of the implementation and result of environmental action and legislation

to stimulate the development and the application within the agency of technique of environmental modelling and forecasting in order that adequate preventative action can be taken at the appropriate time

to help ensure the harmonization and comparability of environmental data in the community a well a the integration of european environmental data into international environmental monitoring programme such a those established within the framework of the united nation and it system of agency
considerable stress is laid by the commission on collaboration with national agency and with state adjacent to the community border
it is envisaged that the totality of activity will extend the existing state of the european environment report cec through addressing the issue of the quality and sensitivity of the environment and also the pressure upon it
priority for the new agency include study of atmospheric emission and quality water resource and quality including the marine environment soil erosion and pollution and important land resource and biotopes and nature conservation
at the time of writing the proposal ha been approved and discussion are in progress on the location of the agency headquarters
it seems certain to have major and growing effect upon environmental monitoring and prediction in europe and on the policy of component government
yet this is by no mean the only plan which the community ha in relation to the environment xii that for science research and development ha published detail of an extensive r d programme cec and the commission a a whole cec ha made public it plan to develop regular official statistic of the environment
the private sector
certain aspect of environmental monitoring have long been carried out by the private sector notably that of crop state on a basis
derived from satellite imagery at comparatively low resolution predicted yield for different crop in different nation state become of commercial value
however significant resource are also being made available by the private sector where there is no immediate commercial gain thus ibm uk ltd ha donated of computing equipment to unep and ibm in general is actively supporting other r d which can be expected to facilitate sustainable development ibm europe for instance ha invested in it bergen scientific centre to make it the focal point for the company environmental modelling and a centre for information on the environment and sustainable development
on a more modest basis ibm uk have agreed to fund a pilot global population database being built in birkbeck college to permit assessment of the impact of environmental change on the world s population
many other company of course are supporting environmental work but ibm seems almost to be unique in it corporate commitment to use of high technology for facilitating sustainable development
some example of environmental monitoring project
the local scale
at the local scale it is usually impossible to neglect the effect of multiple process operating
an example of environmental modelling and prediction where the interaction between different process and dynamic feedback is taken into account is given by haber and schaller
their work formed part of one unesco man and biosphere mab project carried out in the berchtesgaden national park in bavaria
following holling and grossman they conceptualized the relationship at a series of hierarchical level

the lowest or process level is directly and usually obviously connected to perceived reality
thus process and interrelationship are mostly obvious simple and linear data are usually readily available and may be voluminous
this level is readily handled in commercial gi

the intermediate or dynamic level is concerned with le frequent and often irregular event a temporary lack of water because of fire frost or excessive demand from an increasing populace
characteristically the data used may be more difficult to obtain and are usually more spatially aggregated modelling software which permit feedback loop is essential

the top or strategic level is the most difficult to explore the external influence are often unpredictable by formal mean
relevant data are therefore difficult to identify and scenario building is one of the few approach available
the haber and schaller approach is to these different level and their accompanying approach using an ecological balance model
result of running this with different scenario include time slice map of possible outcome and of the exchange of material and energy within the study area
while ultimately qualitative it seems to offer a method for coping with different type of process and incorporating stochastic and truly random event
the national and continental scale the corine project
the corine programme represents the product of much activity by the european commission xi for the environment
it originates from an italian request to the council of minister in to identify environmentally balanced and unbalanced area in the community the first attempt to do this were unsuccessful and though by it wa clear that a new approach based on an environmental information system wa the most promising one funding for this wa not secured until
a experimental programme to collect and ensure the consistency of information on the state of the environment and natural resource in the european community wa set up and labelled corine
the objective of corine were to be achieved through bringing together existing data holding in the member state developing method for holding analysing and presenting the data and encouraging the exchange of data
a number of priority area were identified including biotopes of importance for nature conservation acid deposition and it effect on soil and biotopes and the protection of the environment of the mediterranean region briggs and martin
many achievement can be claimed by the corine project team
a a result of some involving all the member state and often several group within each one database of topography soil water resource and quality biotopes atmospheric emission climate soil erosion and administrative boundary have been built up for the whole community and can be interrelated other data set such a land cover derived from satellite imagery have already been compiled for some of the member state
various aspect of the corine project have been described in paper by rhind et al wiggins et al briggs and martin briggs and mounsey and cec
for the present purpose however the key finding are

many necessary data set were unavailable for reason of administrative inadequacy confidentiality constraint cost or in certain country

the unavoidable reliance upon existing data set led to many problem due to even of commonly used variable eight different definition of potential were in use in the member state and maximum temperature at each weather station wa defined in at least four different way

the compilation of a spatially coherent database from mapped information compiled by different organization at different scale and on different topographic base see rhind and clark is often difficult

user expectation are often unreasonably high use of administrative computing system encourages bureaucrat to believe that environmental data can just a readily be analysed and used to support decision
the fuzzy nature of much geographically distributed data the inherent error in it the effect of the processing algorithm used and the assumption of known interaction between variable ensures that completely routine use by unskilled user is unlikely to be possible in the foreseeable future

more detailed data are required for particular task a the role of corine grows
the european commission proposal for an environment agency see above will subsume the corine team and database
the global scale nasa and
without question the largest player in the global environment arena is nasa
the organization ha initiated many of the scheme which now are under discussion the igbp for instance ha been strongly influenced by nasa proposal
a summary of current activity and future plan is given in nasa
by way of example current programme are collecting global data on stratospheric ozone on and variable and on the earth radiation budget
approved future programme include the upper atmosphere research satellite the nasa scatterometer and the joint ocean topography experiment
in addition however funding ha recently been approved for a much more ambitious scheme the earth observing system eos
this is conceived not a a set of hardware but a a comprehensive information system focused on the need identified by the essc see above and anticipating somewhat those of igbp
it will collate data from the two proposed space station polar platform one european space agency platform a japanese one and also from the manned space station
on this basis a data flow of no le than terabyte byte day is anticipated by the
a major user of nasa data and skill ha been the un environment programme
formed in the wake of the stockholm conference unep soon spawned the global environment monitoring system gem a well a an international register of potentially toxic chemical and a global network of source to locate and provide technical scientific and management information on the environment
the need for a mechanism to handle the global environmental data wa defined in the early and the global resource information database grid resulted
mooneyhan ha described the progress of the pilot stage of grid which culminated in approval for a full operational phase grid is now involved in integrating storing and exploiting a variety of global environmental database mostly acquired from nasa
in addition to the work being carried out in the unep hq at nairobi and in the site in geneva a series of grid regional node are now being set up each equipped with the same hardware and software and local subset of the data
the first of these is in bangkok and another is to be opened in latin america
moreover national node are also being set up the recent ibm gift to grid see above ha ensured that powerful microcomputer have been installed in many african country together with national and continental data set
training of unskilled staff to operate this equipment and to exploit the scientific data is now a major role for grid staff
technical aspect and problem
it follows from much of the above that there are major challenge in use of environmental data
these are best considered by itemizing characteristic of contemporary environmental monitoring and prediction

the use of secondary data rather than primary data collected by the data analyst

the need at least with data on the terrestrial environment for an inference process to extract useful information from the secondary and often proxy data

the data volume collected are often voluminous even by the standard of contemporary computing facility

the analysis carried out are often arcane in detail to all but a small group of high priest

we have only a limited capacity for checking the accuracy of many environmental monitoring result let alone of prediction
some of these characteristic are now addressed in slightly more detail it will be obvious that such problem merit a paper in themselves
remote sensing a a data collection process
a the need for more extensive yet consistent and data becomes more pressing increased use of remote sensing seems inevitable
no other data collection methodology obviates the short distance variation in data set induced by variation in data collection and aggregation methodology typically encountered between adjacent nation state
the problem is now recognized especially in europe and strenuous effort are being made to harmonise the data set through the use of standard classification such a that for land use produced by the conference of european statistician in
at present however environmental data are far le than ideal
recognizing this nasa concluded that forthcoming global science project would need land surface altitude data at three resolution km resolution in xy and m resolution in z on a global basis m xy resolution and m resolution in z for regional database and m xy resolution and m in z for local study
they argued that existing map and digitized file from them are unable to meet these need at global or regional scale and only remote sensing could help in the short term the availability of stereometric data from the french spot satellite ha already led to proposal for automated creation of global digital elevation model with a spatial xy resolution of about m muller
for many terrestrial purpose however a substantial inference process must take place to convert the radiometric measurement into useful information in contrast more direct measurement of sea state etc are possible
the value of this information is inherently dependent upon the quality of the inference process and that in turn depends upon the complexity of the scene the spatial temporal and spectral resolution of the sensor and the particular algorithm used
thus far for instance accuracy of land cover let alone what is often needed land use determined from landsat and spot imagery for the uk have rarely been higher than per cent unless trivial classification land have been used
one solution to this is to densify the ground control and another is to use contextually based classifier rather than the traditional spectrally based one
but the ground condition in some part of europe make good result extremely difficult to obtain some area of portugal for instance have field size of only a few metre and exhibit and cropping
a further difficulty is the cost of the data in relation to it anticipated benefit
relatively few study have yet been carried out except in such area a crop prediction and ocean navigation where they are generally shown to be highly advantageous in saving someone else money
it may be that a study commissioned from contractor by the british national space centre will provide useful evidence on the cash value of remote sensing it is particularly timely in view of the appointment of professor pearce see above a the adviser to the uk secretary of state for the environment
other work on assessment of cost and benefit of such data have been carried out for the french government by professor didier
finally since data are often costly to acquire it follows that summary of them the state of the european environment report cec and the environmental data report of the un ep gem marc are of considerable value
equally the signposting role now being adopted by unep grid project which is expected to offer access to a catalogue of environmental data set and detail of the responsible agency in is to be welcomed
the data problem and partial solution
the lack of harmonization of definition and method of collection of environmental data have already been outlined above
in the european community of nation state for instance no le than eight procedure for calculating potential have been in use
the need for harmonization is obvious and in this respect must follow from the successful pioneering achievement of eurostat in harmonizing the definition in trade demographic and other social science statistic see cec
an additional and severe problem is that the volume of data which are already collected are huge by the standard of only a decade ago
by they will be very much greater notably from the eos programme
nasa ha announced plan to collect up to terabyte byte day
since remote sensing data set especially those pertaining to terrestrial area of the globe typically need much to calibrate transform and then perform an inference process and hence convert measurement of the radiation reflected or emitted by small area of ground into useful land cover data the processing power required is going to be formidable
other data set are smaller in volume but more complex in structure and in their characteristic
to hold all of the scale topographic map coverage alone for the european community would probably require about terabyte of storage
parenthetically the form in which the data may be held can affect dramatically the scale of the problem faced
it would be technically possible for instance to hold in le than terabyte detailed information for every individual in the world akin to that collected about everyone in the uk through the census of population
in practice legislation generally forbids such data being held thus and distributed in anything other than area aggregate form the commonly employed to give table of population number broken down by age and sex often result in a great multiplication of the data volume
this all present major problem of data storage handling especially for global data set display and dissemination
fortunately technical development have ensured that the increase in computing power per unit cost ha been growing at about an order of magnitude every year over the last three decade
indeed this may grossly the present situation the rapid spread of system seems to facilitate competition and at the time of writing performance of workstation per unit cost seems to be increasing at about per cent per annum
moreover the advent of device like may well make substantial data set available even to those with modest computing power a for instance can hold about megabyte byte can be reproduced currently for about and read on a device costing about
yet despite such revolutionary change in technology novel solution will still be required to make effective use of the new data set
one such solution is goodchild and yang scheme for a hierarchical spatial data structure to handle data for the spherical earth
a particular problem is that little or no quantitative regard ha been paid until recently to the effect of quality variation in environmental data
the literature of the last few year is thronged with paper proposing that these must be taken into account but with few realistic proposal on how this is to be achieved
goodchild ha made perhaps the best summary of the problem and possible solution to date
finally relatively little emphasis ha been given to the management of data a a corporate resource available to a wide community many environmental data are collected on a basis and lost once the urgency of the initial research is over
however the report of the data and facility working group of the uk committee on global environmental change argued strongly that planning for the dissemination and maintenance of such data wa a vital role
it also noted that ownership of and access to environmental data wa a policy matter of the greatest importance this may be more difficult in within country data than with global data since the latter are often already the subject of international exchange agreement at zero cost
global environmental research and the social science
thus far the emphasis ha been very much on the natural science aspect of environmental monitoring and prediction
that is unremarkable since the anticipation of such problem and assessment of some of their cause and magnitude can only be made by environmental scientist
yet the consequence of any significant change are a matter of the utmost concern to planner and to politician at all level the quantification of the cost and benefit of alternative policy strategy is very much a matter for economist and the adaptation of society to massive change is a particular interest to sociologist and others
for geographer who span the conventional and now archaic dichotomy between the natural and the environmental science all of these aspect need to be woven together to anticipate the likely spatial pattern of the effect of massive change the redistribution in trade health and wealth which they will bring about and the knock on effect these consequence themselves will have on society and the environment
for social scientist then environmental monitoring and prediction are a matter of considerable significance especially a globalization of market and economy proceeds
the economic and social research council esrc commissioned two report on global environmental change to guide or at least inform the allocation of research funding
these report pearce turner may be taken a informed view from at least the economist in the uk social science community on the social science aspect of global environmental change
pearce for instance presented an economist view of the topic for research a follows

the theory and practice of international agreement viewed in a game theory context

the theory of optimal behaviour under scientific uncertainty

framework especially for dealing with climatic effect

definition of the impact of climate change on eastern europe and the developing country

appropriate policy on dioxide greenhouse gas

assessment of the ecological value of tropical forest

economic instrument for reducing greenhouse gas

the international politics of climate change

national and global energy option given the greenhouse effect

trade and global change
turner argued that the priority are a follows

the consequence of rise

technique for the valuation of environmental resource and effect

an assessment of management tool institutional adaptation and policy integration in regard to global environmental change

study of agriculture in relation to climate change

understanding of how environmental issue and technical change interact

the interrelationship between environmental ethic and economics
there is then no shortage of social science research which is claimed to be necessary if we are to cope with environmental change
some of it is being carried out in march esrc announced a programme of research on global environmental change
however perhaps most critical of all in the early stage is social science practice rather than research
in the usa at least there need to be an improvement in scientist understanding of how to influence the allocation of funding for remedial measure or for further research see kitsos and ashe
all too often it seems that the coupling of an a yet imperfect scientific understanding to is tenuous see table
fortunately considerable work ha already begun on the legal political and institutional aspect of global environmental change see for instance nitze
what next
the content of this chapter have scarcely touched upon such important environmental research a the world ocean climate experiment or the world climate research programme
nor ha there been any discussion of the growing requirement in the uk a elsewhere to carry out an environmental impact assessment for all major development
the consequence for some nation or subgroup in a population of being without access to environmental data or the tool for analysing them while others have such access are potentially profound a the european commission ha recognized in issuing a directive on public access to environmental data cec yet space limitation have also precluded their discussion
despite these shortcoming dictated by the space available what ha been said should be sufficient to illustrate the enormous and diverse scope of environmental monitoring and prediction
such is it diversity that measuring the total expenditure on it seems quite impossible and the number of actor already involved is vast
what is clear however is that monitoring is rarely a simple exercise that the of the sponsor of monitoring and environmental research are rarely long term though most science is inevitably of this nature and that the increasingly multinational nature of such work necessitates a degree of management not always present in local or nationally based scheme
in these circumstance it is scarcely surprising that there is evidence of international and interdisciplinary dispute a terney ha chronicled in regard to igbp
moreover a newby ha pointed out the complexity of environmental research have created a new kind of relationship between research and policy in the past the relationship wa predicated on the belief that science provided with objective hard fact on which to base their soft policy
but now we find scientist delivering only soft uncertain fact to facing hard decision
yet even if all of this cause great uncertainty among scientist it is still a reasonable prediction that a decade ahead will see both environmental monitoring and prediction treated a an everyday need and activity in major organization
we shall also see the existence of binding requirement upon national government certainly in the european community to collect at least basic environmental indicator in a harmonized form cec
more than that it seems highly likely that the social science aspect of environmental problem will underpin the action of government and international agency
perhaps the single most important conclusion to be drawn from this review is that the monitoring modelling and management of the global environment are task which uniquely require the integration of skill and technique from many discipline
building such research team is essential
underlying it all however is one obvious fact that the gathering and analysis of geographically distributed environmental data form the necessary for ensuring the success of our future on earth

managing natural and technological hazard
anthony gatrell and peter vincent
introduction
few area of the application of gi technology can be a socially significant or environmentally relevant a the management of emergency and disaster due to natural and technological hazard
whether attempting to construct a database of resource for use in planning response to nuclear emergency developing optimal route for scheduling the safe transport of hazardous substance or monitoring the health implication of a disaster gi can assist in identifying possibility and formulating solution
the have been declared the international decade for natural disaster reduction
let u hope that can in some small way help mitigate the suffering and hardship felt by all those afflicted by the effect of hazard which a we have learnt with bitter recent experience in the uk can occur in an untimely fashion in the most improbable of place
research on hazard is multidisciplinary and straddle the social environmental and mathematical science
if for instance we wish to model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas resulting from a chemical explosion ass it possible impact on human health and evaluate likely evacuation scenario of the population at risk we would require for example a knowledge of atmospheric dispersion model epidemiology and population distribution
some researcher suggest that hazard and emergency that might result can be regarded a either natural or technological
we shall elaborate on this simple division below but suggest here that the wealth of literature on the former see for instance burton et al and perry ha yet to be matched by a similar volume of work on the latter
there are sign that this imbalance is being rectified zeigler et al
hazard research like few other gi application area is not only stretching the present technology to it limit but is a quite remarkable focus of international effort into several important area such a expert system and simulation study
in this sense the scene is clearly one of hazard problem looking for improved gi rather than for gi looking for good problem a is all too often the case
hazard research
what are hazard
formally a hazard can be defined a a physical situation with a potential for human injury damage to property damage to the environment or some combination of these health and safety executive
a hazard is a threat which given a set of circumstance may become translated into a realized event
what we choose to call this event depends upon factor such a it magnitude we speak for instance of accident emergency disaster and catastrophe each of which carry connotation concerning the scale of the event and each of which will have a set of human environmental consequence
on march one of the most powerful volcanic disturbance this century the bezymianny eruption occurred
few people noticed the event a it took place in an uninhabited part of kamchatcka and caused no known casualty
in contrast the extrusion of a small volume of lava from a secondary cone on the slope of tristan da cunha became the focus of global interest when during october the island lobster processing plant wa smothered and the people of the island only settlement were evacuated to the uk
these two contrasting event emphasize the central fact that even natural hazard are not defined solely by the characteristic of the event but by the interaction of those event with the human occupation of the threatened area
a noted above the simple division of hazard is between those which are natural and those which are technological or
each of these may be further subdivided and the typology shown in fig draw upon the classic work of burton and kates in separating geophysical from biological hazard and zeigler et al in distinguishing public or what we might call societal hazard from private individual one
the further subdivision of natural hazard is a is that of individual technological hazard
zeigler divide the public hazard into those which result from the production of raw material and manufactured good those which originate in transport and transmission and those which threaten the public in their role a consumer
the united nation disaster relief organization undro ha produced a classification of disaster derived on the basis of case data table
undro recognizes three basic type of disaster accident natural event and other disaster
the differentiation of accident from other type is useful in the context of emergency planning and is not so clearly conveyed by other hazard typology
however the temptation in all classification exercise is to produce partitional scheme and this should really be resisted here
it is more useful johnson to adopt a scheme fig that recognizes for instance food poisoning a both a personal and consumer hazard or lead pollution from car exhaust a both a meteorological event and technological hazard both public and private
an air crash a at lockerbie affect an entire community directly a well a being an occupational hazard and risk to the individual traveller
hillslope failure a at aberfan in south wale in is a geomorphic hazard but may arise because of raw material extraction
dutch elm disease is a floral hazard but is exacerbated by the transport of infected log
hohensemer et al make the important point that hazard are multidimensional in nature and suggest dimension along which any hazard may be scored see table
these factor will of course be important in deciding on the role that gi can play in hazard monitoring and emergency planning
for instance some event will persist briefly have immediate consequence minor transgenerational effect and have little or no potential for mortality an air crash is an example
others such a a chemical explosion involving the release of a toxic gas may persist for a week or more have delayed consequence may affect a future generation if the toxic chemical is mutagenic and may have a significant impact on plant and animal population
there may be more scope for a gi approach in the latter than in the former situation
the hohensemer scheme is not however beyond criticism
for example can hazard really be thought of a having any intentionality
industrial hazard and risk assessment
once hazard have been identified there may follow effort to ass the hazard risk
by risk we understand the likelihood of a specified undesired event occurring within a specified period or in specified circumstance health and safety executive
it may of course be easier to quantify risk for natural hazard because of historical record and statistical estimation of recurrence interval
technological hazard are more unpredictable and may be extremely rare so that it becomes difficult to use probability concept to quantify risk especially those which rely on notion of relative frequency
the identification of chemical hazard requires that the location of site be known together with the dangerous substance stored or processed there
in the uk see petts for a splendid overview the health and safety executive must be notified of site where hazardous substance in excess of threshold limit are handled
such substance and threshold include for instance tonne of flammable liquid petroleum gas and the explosive sodium chlorate and tonne of toxic chlorine gas
some installation are notifiable along with thousand of kilometre of pipeline mostly natural gas transmission line
following a number of major accident involving industrial activity including those at flixborough humberside in beek the netherlands in and seveso and manfredonia in italy in the ec issued a directive on major accident hazard
the directive which is commonly referred to a the seveso directive wa issued in june and in the uk it requirement were embodied in the control of major accident hazard cimah regulation
among other thing these regulation require operator of hazardous installation to draw up and emergency plan and to give information to member of the public who live or work near such installation houston
there are presently about cimah site
however many potentially hazardous chemical installation are not covered by such regulation
clearly a plant which store tonne le than is required for notification slip through the net while large number of handling site warehouse for instance are not covered
the regulation have obvious implication for work a illustrated below
in halton borough cheshire for instance there are notifiable installation with over people living within the defined consultation zone petts
it is also relevant to point out here the work of the health and safety executive in developing technique for quantitative risk assessment health and safety executive
such technique include the use of a risk assessment tool riskat input to which include data on wind direction and speed the output of which is a map of calculated risk contour
in societal risk assessment it is also necessary to input data on the distribution of population around the installation
this can be a difficult and process and inevitably some simplifying assumption are needed health and safety executive
again the implication are clear and are discussed below
hazardous waste disposal
the disposal of both nuclear and waste ha proved to be of major public concern in recent year
the rather clumsy handling by nirex of the search for site to store and waste together with very recent worry about the import of toxic waste such a polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs are but two example of such concern in the uk
however while the former ha been given considerable attention by geographer summarized by openshaw et al there ha been relatively little such work in the uk on the disposal of waste
this contrast with the situation in the usa greenberg and anderson where the of abandoned site is a priority
certainly in term of the volume of waste generated in the uk hazardous industrial waste should be high on the environmental agenda while le than million tonne of all nuclear waste were generated in time that amount were generated of hazardous waste openshaw et al
attention should be drawn to the three annual report of the hazardous waste inspectorate now merged with other branch of the doe to form her majesty inspectorate of pollution
these contain some valuable material on disposal practice and volume of waste generated and disposed of by each waste regulation authority wra county in england district in wale scotland and northern ireland
each wra is required to produce a waste disposal plan and these are starting to appear
they too contain useful material on for instance the location of site though individual site licence must be consulted for detail of what each is permitted to take in the way of hazardous waste
what is not known is information on the location of former site at which quite toxic material may have been dumped though recent work by egger in austria ha mapped a vast number of such site
it is these rather than existing licensed site which should be a focus of research activity particularly when examining possible link to ill health
we simply do not have enough evidence yet to back up the claim that people are almost certainly ill dead or dying because of these sloppy waste disposal activity openshaw et al
research is in progress however to ass possible health effect of poor incineration diggle et al
particular attention should be focused on hospital incinerator since these have been subject to crown immunity for many year and most are technically to burn at sufficiently high temperature for adequate disposal of waste gatrell and lovett
we need to produce an inventory of all such site together with a publicly available comprehensive database on all site accepting hazardous industrial waste
emergency planning
it is convenient to retain the distinction when discussing the background to emergency planning
nuclear emergency planning in the uk ha been reviewed by matthew and pepper
nuclear power station must prepare a plan and submit this to the nuclear installation inspectorate and health and safety executive for approval
evacuation plan are required to cover an area within a distance of km these detail the role to be played by the emergency service
the very narrow emergency planning zone contrast with those in the usa collins where planning is required up to km from the site to cover exposure to radiation plume
local authority in the uk that have declared themselves have been highly critical of british planning calling for an extension of emergency zone to at least km
zeigler et al should be consulted for material relating to evacuation behaviour in the wake of the incident at three mile island
in the uk little work of any description seems to have been done on human behaviour in the aftermath of release of hazardous substance nor is much available on public attitude to emergency planning
indeed no major study of evacuation due to hazard have been undertaken in recent time and this is a widely recognized deficiency which no research funding body seems willing to rectify
in the usa on the other hand a good deal of useful research in these area ha been undertaken
this research is brought together in very useful report produced by the oak ridge national laboratory tennessee sorenson et al vogt and sorenson and the disaster research centre university of delaware
perry ha written an interesting book on emergency planning and evacuation covering both natural and technological hazard
for him comprehensive emergency planning and management involve prevention protection response and restoration
by prevention we understand the elimination or reduction in risk perhaps by adequate zoning or safe routeing of shipment for instance
included in protection are method for detecting likely hazard event and in warning those likely to be affected
response includes search and rescue including the need to cope with secondary threat such a contamination of water supply after an explosion or fire following an earthquake
a perry and others have noted relatively few resource are devoted to the first two aspect the bulk going to response and restoration rebuilding
it should be clear from this brief description that these issue are inherently geographical
in one of the few study of evacuation behaviour after a hazard event liverman and wilson give weight to this argument
in a train carrying chlorine liquid petroleum toluene and propane wa derailed in mississauga ontario causing a series of explosion
this led to the evacuation of people which although staggered over several day led to great pressure on transport artery
an important finding wa that many relied on their own transport and went to stay with friend and relative some distance away rather than relying on the official evacuation reception centre
despite this the evacuation wa successful partly because the accident occurred at a weekend and the immediately affected area wa sparsely populated
in addition the police were well prepared stimulated largely by implementing a plan designed more to cope with an emergency at the nearby toronto international airport than for the event in question
it is not without interest to note that in the usa there is a federal emergency management agency fema established in charged with dealing with all type of emergency planning and management
in the uk there is no equivalent though the spate of disaster in the past year involving over life lost ha led to several call for such a national body to be established
natural hazard
in this short space it is not possible to go into any depth on the nature of particular natural hazard but only to highlight those aspect relevant to gi
needle to say the study of natural hazard is important a statement brought into sharp focus by the fact that natural hazard account for up to per cent of total death in the world each year mitchell
in for example more than people died in the cyclone and flooding of bangladesh and in the hurricane david and frederick caused more than damage in the usa
shah made a comprehensive investigation of natural disaster report for the period and concluded that both disaster frequency and magnitude measured in term of life lost are increasing
high death toll are still a characteristic of le developed country
surprisingly fog is the third most important hazard in europe after flood and volcano
research on natural hazard ha a long tradition in geography going back more than half a century
much of the impetus for such research arose in the usa from observation on river basin management and the need to reduce flood damage
the vast majority of natural hazard study have ignored the physical nature of the event per se and have concentrated on behavioural issue such a the perception and estimation of hazard
this emphasis is partly due to the background of the researcher involved many are human geographer and sociologist and partly because it is only really since the second world war that major hazard have been monitored systematically culminating of course in the last decade or so in the use of satellite technology
brief reference to two example of natural hazard may illustrate the potential relevance of a gi approach application of which are considered below
jones et al have examined the distribution of some landslide in the uk
their map show clearly an increased propensity for landsliding in the north and west of the uk
more to the point however is the fact that this distribution can be modelled in term of slope rainfall rock type and so on
in other word the actual hazard distribution can be understood and area at risk identified
the potential benefit to insurance company engineer and planner are clear
second a winter hazard in the uk with marked spatial localization is fog
predictive model of it distribution have clear implication for road and air safety
perry describes a fog potential index that is a function of local topography environmental feature affecting fog formation and distance from standing water body
reliance is currently placed on a network of monitoring station often sparsely located and frequently outside area gi could implement a predictive model based on digitized map feature and indeed the model could also be used in site allocation study for airport and the like
the majority of natural hazard research ha focused on single hazard but of course any area may be prone to more than one hazard type
this idea led hewitt and burton to develop the concept of
to achieve this they concentrated on the whole spectrum of damaging event in an area and explored their aggregate impact
the implication for gi in the development of hazardousness index are obvious and if data are available there is the potential to produce a variety of probability map
the collection of historical data on natural hazard is important since it is clear that their spatial pattern varies through time
many area that appear to be on current map may merely by passing through a temporary period of quiescence
this is perhaps best illustrated with reference to earthquake
for example in the whole of southern england wa affected by an earthquake whose epicentre wa located in what is now belgium a good deal of minor structural damage wa inflicted morse
presumably the builder of the channel tunnel are aware of this
environmental epidemiology
this is of course a vast subject area embracing the impact of the natural and technological environment on human health
it cover for instance the association between water and air pollution and ill health link between geological and pedological environment and ill health a well a association between specific technological hazard power line and possible health effect
we can only consider a small fraction of this work here little consideration is given to occupational environment for instance
in the uk such research is widespread though there are specialist environmental epidemiology research institute at southampton and cardiff funded by the medical research council and others at the university of surrey robens institute and at the london school for hygiene and tropical medicine
the latter house the small area health statistic research unit sahsru which ha a specific remit to conduct research into morbidity and mortality at local scale elliot
the sahsru liaises closely with opcs
the kind of database used by these group are discussed below
greenberg and a collection of paper in greenberg review some of the literature on environmental epidemiology
it seems worth stating at the outset that there are two way geographical research in this general area can proceed
one is to collect morbidity and mortality data usually the latter is more widely available though the former more useful and to examine spatial distribution for clustering
this ha itself generated a substantial literature see the paper in elliot for an overview and is nowhere better exemplified than in openshaw geographical analysis machine see ch
we then search retrospectively for evidence of possible environmental association
an alternative approach is to begin by hypothesizing an environmental determinant of ill health and to collect data to test an explicit hypothesis
if an association is suggested then we would want to collect data in other area to ass the hypothesis further
of course these two approach are not in practice in many case the hypothesis of interest will have themselves been generated by inductive mapping
one example of an hypothesis which ha been given serious attention in recent year is the possible link between electromagnetic field generated by power line or supply cable and ill health
some work perry et al suggested association with mental illness and suicide while others wertheimer and leeper have examined link to various cancer including leukaemia
a good bibliography is provided in perry and pearl
the central electricity generating board now privatized and split into two company is funding a project to ass link to childhood cancer while another recently announced study aim to look at link to sudden infant death
one obvious problem with implication for any gi input is that the effect are highly localized with little measurable field effect more than a few dozen metre away from the route
accuracy of digital data collection either of the power line or residential location is paramount
there seems to be a growing interest in examining association between ill health and the geological environment
gi work in this field matthew is reviewed later but we note here the work of the applied geochemistry group at imperial college responsible for a series of atlas on regional geochemistry and the existence of a society for environmental geochemistry and health
one area of recent debate concern radon gas and it link to lung cancer
this is taken very seriously in the usa where the environmental protection agency estimate that death from lung cancer each year are due to radon gas exposure
estimate from scandinavia suggest that per cent of such death are caused by exposure to radon richardson
the gas is trapped in house and is produced by the decay of uranium in rock and soil thus it ha been measured at high concentration in part of cornwall and devon
there are great difficulty in assessing health effect however since exposure varies greatly from house to house within small neighbourhood
carefully designed study are therefore required to measure the separate effect of radon exposure after controlling for smoking behaviour and other risk factor
other health concern which might merit attention by those involved in the regional research laboratory rrl initiative include air and water pollution
the debate about lead pollution from vehicle exhaust emission is well known le publicity ha been given to pahs polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon a product of combustion process and known to be carcinogenic lioy and daisey
research at the north west regional research laboratory nwrrl aim to create buffer around busy road and junction and to use data from the cancer registry to examine possible link between proximity to such source of pollution and prevalence of lung cancer
those with an interest in health and air pollution should note the availability of a very detailed database from the warren spring laboratory containing detail of smoke and sulphur dioxide emission at a large number of site in the uk
the possible link between nitrate in water and stomach cancer is the subject of much debate beresford a is the association between aluminium content and alzheimer disease
the problem of assessing such link are of course huge but there is scope for a contribution
the role of gi in hazard management scenario example
a we have already implied gi ha a role to play in all aspect of hazard research from hazard monitoring risk assessment and emergency planning to coping with an event and evaluating it consequence
the example described below illustrate all these though a yet there do not appear to be many instance of disaster in the management of which gi ha played a significant part
technological hazard emergency planning and gi
a considerable amount of research ha been undertaken to apply gi method to evacuation scenario around hazardous site
much of this research ha concentrated on network analysis of the road system
reference wa made above to cimah site major hazardous installation for which and emergency plan must be prepared
early research at the nwrrl focused on developing a gi for use by the police and county emergency planning officer in cumbria that would aid in the management of a possible explosion at a chemical factory in whitehaven west cumbria vincent et al dunn
the police required a portable system that could be implemented on an microcomputer
this wa written at the nwrrl using fortran and the graphical kernel system
the gi is and is exceptionally pl
it open with an outline map and the superimposition of the rather rigid zone used by the emergency planner
full zoom facility are available at any stage
in any emergency it is of course vital to have data on the distribution of population and resource
the system incorporates digitized data on the distribution of all domestic and property in the town together with digitized road data
both set of data were provided by pinpoint analysis ltd who are undertaking this digitizing task for the entire country
other spatially referenced data incorporated into the system include those on the distribution of school medical and transport service which can be displayed and supplementary information about them obtained
the gi permit population estimate to be made for any arbitrary rectangular region on the map
most significantly it incorporates a shortest path algorithm which us the road network to find optimal route between start and end node
although predating the rrl initiative by several year and indeed the emergence of gi a a major research area we should remind ourselves of openshaw work on appraising nuclear reactor site
using what would now be called gi skill openshaw examined over km grid square in the uk which intersect the coastline and related these to data from the census which were made available for such grid square
he demonstrated that there is an abundance of remote site in contrast to the official view that such site were increasingly hard to find
he suggested that in early spatial search for site only a small number were ever identified in the first place because rigorous search could not be performed by manual mean with poor quality data openshaw
heywood and cornelius have shown how gi can be used for monitoring possible radiation release and thus the relevance of gi in nuclear emergency planning and monitoring
they propose a national radiological spatial information system and in a pilot project in cumbria have integrated several layer of data within to show what this might involve fig
such data include those from the population and agricultural census a well a point data from rain gauge site and radiation monitoring station
a an example the system is used to determine restriction zone for the movement of sheep after the explosion at chernobyl in
this is done by finding area of high rainfall and parish with high sheep population
the map overlay of point and area information show generally good agreement with the restriction zone imposed by the ministry of agriculture fishery and food with the exception of a small area to the of cumbria bordering on lancashire
the british government carried out a review of it arrangement for handling nuclear accident overseas following the chernobyl accident
the doe through her majesty inspectorate of pollution hmip wa given the task of a national response plan installing the radiation monitoring network and acting a lead government department in an emergency hmso
the monitoring network ha become known a the radioactive incident monitoring network rimnet and ha a it prime responsibility the detection of abnormal increase in radiation level within the uk of the kind that might arise from an overseas nuclear accident
the full implementation of the rimnet system will take some time
by the end of gamma radiation dose monitor had been installed at meteorological station a part of phase of the development programme
radiation reading are taken every hour at each station and are transmitted to a central computer which analysis the data
the current criterion for alert is two reading of more than three time normal background either successively at the same site or simultaneously at two adjacent site
the dissemination of information in the event of an incident is dealt with at three level the first is the normal system of press notice the second is the use of teletext and viewdata ceefax and prestel to get direct to member of the public at their home or place of work the third is the use of telecom gold electronic mail to get more technical detail to various official body such a water authority jackson
phase of the rimnet scheme will be completed by the end of when between and monitoring site will have been established
given very wide regional and local variation in deposition question must be raised about the effectiveness of such a small network local authority will need to supplement it with their own network
there are important analytical problem to be addressed concerning the siting of such monitoring equipment and these are elaborated on later
abroad kaspar ha discussed a exercise with gi overtone involving the simulated evacuation of the population living in the vicinity of the neckarwestheim nuclear power plant in baden
in the scenario he outline an area affected by radioactive release is determined the population within that area is allocated to reception area with capacity constraint evacuation route are identified and traffic restriction implemented
little detail is provided however and it is thus difficult to evaluate his work fully
dangermond describes the use of the network module for use in emergency planning situation
he describes how a road network is digitized and subsequently analysed using allocation districting and routeing algorithm
allocation determines which arc in the network will be allocated to a particular node or centre districting make it possible to outline rapidly set of polygon in order to define specific area of interest district and to summarize their characteristic routeing provides a minimum path algorithm through the network the arc of which can be assigned weight according to road condition road capacity and so on
dangermond give several example in his paper including the use of network for the allocation of emergency vehicle optimum routeing of fire engine from garage to the accident scene and the movement of spill through sewer and river network
when combined with the other facility in quite complex disaster management scenario can be handled
for example earthquake fault zone can be combined with data on housing density and structural detail to predict earthquake damage level and these data then related to the network model
vincent illustrates the use of and it network module for finding safe route for chlorine transhipment on the road and rail system of england pl
in this case population density data for a km buffer on either side of network arc were overlaid on the network itself so a to act a weight for the minimum path algorithm
chosen route were those which minimized population rather than distance
hazardous waste disposal
there can be little doubt that a gi approach ha wide applicability in all sort of location problem where the goal is to minimize rather than a conventionally maximize accessibility to a population
a particularly good application is to the search for potential site for the disposal of nuclear and but none the le hazardous waste
we discus here some relevant work on the siting of facility for the disposal of nuclear waste before examining those for waste
the major contribution to informed debate about the search for site for the disposal of nuclear waste ha come from a group of geographer openshaw et al and a gi approach to this problem can pay high dividend
the work of carver see openshaw et al ch is an interesting example
one advantage is the ability to model a range of alternative by allowing particular criterion to enter or be omitted from the polygon overlay operation
conceptually what is offered is little more than an automated sieve mapping that planner have used for many year but the whole procedure is speeded up by many order of magnitude using gi software
the author examine both site and deep repository which use more restricted population criterion and allow offshore location to enter
data layer include geological map conservation area transport route petrochemical facility and demographic data
a different layer are added sequentially we see how the proportion of available land shrink pl for instance when geological criterion are set in the search for a deep repository per cent of land area remains and the addition of the population density layer reduces this to per cent
however adding a proximity to transport constraint lower this to per cent and so on
we can not pretend gi is a solution to the political problem of negotiation and justification but at the very least the openness of the procedure go some way towards satisfying a worried public
gi research into site selection for hazardous waste ha been almost exclusively conducted in north america and ha yet to be matched in the uk
jensen and christiansen working in the usa use a raster approach with a pixel resolution of m and boolean overlay to weed out particular site such a those which are poorly drained environmentally sensitive or inaccessible see also stewart
environmental monitoring of site for the disposal of toxic waste is of particular concern in the usa
the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla legislation of superfund requires the cleaning up of the worst landfill site of which some had been identified by the environmental protection agency by foresman
a major worry ha been the threat posed by groundwater pollution and some research ha been conducted on using gi to monitor this merchant et al barringer et al von braun
this is an important topic since per cent of rural household in the usa consume only groundwater while half the u population consumes at least some groundwater merchant et al
clearly the research demand access to exceptionally good environmental data usually in three dimension
a foresman suggests we might expect remote sensing technology to play a major role
merchant et al for example use the image processing system erdas to construct an index of vulnerability to groundwater pollution this us variable such a depth to water table soil type slope and so on see estes et al for a similar approach
barringer et al overlay data on soil type and geology with that of groundwater quality hardness and corrosivity measure and build a linear model which show that the background environmental variable are good predictor of the water quality index
again a approach is used
a further example is work by von braun who us pmap to look at exposure of organic and metallic compound in groundwater in the vicinity of tucson airport arizona
using plume model that predict the movement of contaminant she is able to intersect the result with data on current well location and to ass which water supply area are worst contaminated
overlaying the result with residential location data provides map delineating exposure for each residence in each von braun
in principle it is then possible to compare such dos with epidemiological data once again indicating a link from a hazard event to assessment of health outcome
attention should be drawn to foresman comment that the u geological survey usgs at the eros data centre have successfully linked to a model of groundwater flow foresman
this kind of link between gi and other modelling program is to be warmly welcomed and parallel work at the nwrrl in linking gi and air pollution plume model
natural hazard and disaster management
several study in recent paper have shown the effectiveness of gi in mitigating the effect of major natural hazard
berke and ruch for example describe a gi for assessing the impact of hurricane on the texas gulf coast
hurricane damage through high wind and tidal surge cause an immense amount of destruction and pose a major threat to many coastal community in the usa
it ha been estimated for example that during the mid some million u citizen were subject to hurricane wind of over and million were subject to hurricane surge brinkman
the system described by berke and ruch is and ha an interesting modelling component called slosh sea lake and overland surge from hurricane
slosh is able to estimate still water surge by grid cell for various hurricane intensity angle of approach to the shoreline forward movement speed and landfall location
additional algorithm are used to model total building damage cost for each grid cell based on and rating curve
hobeika and jamei describe the massevacuation massvac simulation software designed to analyse and evaluate traffic evacuation plan given a natural disaster in an urban area
the system comprises three interrelated module community and disaster type characteristic module population distribution module network evacuation module
the type of natural disaster determines the time period within which the road network ha to be evacuated
the control and management strategy are directly correlated to each specific disaster scenario
massvac is quite flexible and various road network option are available such a traffic signal timing on the road network traffic reserved lane for special vehicle such a those of the emergency service
hobeika and jamei have tested massvac on various evacuation scenario for virginia beach city in order to determine evacuation time for flood and hurricane condition
in general they suggest that the model provided reasonable and reliable evacuation time
southworth et al have enhanced the massvac model with the addition of a colour graphic module which they call mvopl
this module ha been developed using ibm graphic kernel system and provides a number of display screen
the most interesting are those which portray population flow a scaled ribbon on the network diagram and evacuation shelter capacity a bar diagram
the diagram are updated periodically during the course of the simulation
in dry part of the world such a australia forest and bush fire are an important natural hazard and some attention ha been given to the way in which gi might help examine their potential impact
kessell describes a gi called preplan pristine environment planning language which is a natural area management planning and fire modelling system developed for the australian national park and wildlife service preplan comprises four module a simple gi a grid cell resource database a wide range of vegetation fuel fire behaviour erosion and model tabular statistical and colour graphic output system
with this system fire growth can be modelled taking into account change in terrain fuel and temporal change in the weather
kessell point out that uncontrollable fire are recurrent phenomenon in many part of australia causing damage in the hundred of million of dollar and significant loss of life
system such a preplan can provide the user with sound model of the behaviour pattern of fire and are therefore of enormous value in planning
one of the most widespread natural hazard is flooding and the potential for loss of property risk to life and general social disruption is large
one interesting example of a gi approach to flood damage estimation is the anuflood package which wa developed in the early following detailed flood damage study for coastal town in northern new south wale australia smith and greenaway
the anuflood system requires locational and building type data on individual property curve relating the average damage that would result from overfloor flooding to differing depth for each property type and lastly flood frequency in term of flood height expressed a a probability
output from the system is both tabular and graphical
of particular interest is the construction of map showing the expected annual amount of damage for gridded area
anuflood also contains module which permit the investigation of various flood damage mitigation option such a property height raising levee construction and flood proofing
environmental epidemiology
the possibility sketched above relate to emergency planning the search for hazardous site and risk assessment
to what extent can gi help if an event occurs
what for instance of the health consequence
there is a rich tradition of epidemiological work in geography and with the increasing availability of spatially referenced medical data the scope for gi application is wide gatrell
for instance diggle et al ass the hypothesis that cancer of the larynx is associated with proximity to a incinerator and develop a statistical model from the theory of spatial point process to test this
this would have been impossible without the link provided from postcoded data increasingly available from source such a cancer registry to ordnance survey o grid reference
such a link is provided by the central postcode directory which match all million unit postcode in the uk to grid reference
when the case of laryngeal cancer are compared with a null distribution provided by the distribution of much more common lung cancer the hypothesis is given strong support
although the proposed method is novel it is but one of an increasingly large number of method designed to detect and model cluster of disease see for example cuzick and edward
the work of diggle et al examined only a single point source though it generalizes to multiple source and to linear hazard a well
a a second example of health work linked to hazard study we may cite the research being conducted by cross on childhood leukaemia
there are numerous hypothesis concerning the aetiology of this disease from ionizing radiation to viral transmission and cross approach is to collect digital data designed to test some of these hypothesis and to use to display and analyse result
for instance one hypothesis concern the role of electromagnetic radiation a source of which is overhead transmission line a noted earlier
if these are digitized and buffer zone constructed around them fig we can quite easily test hypothesis about prevalence in such buffer zone a compared with prevalence outside
however we should bear in mind the earlier point about the resolution of the data since such electromagnetic effect have a very weak effect beyond perhaps m wertheimer and leeper
there ha been a suspicion for many year that high rate of stomach cancer in part of wale may be linked to soil chemistry specifically such factor a ratio and to lead content in water supply
matthew ha used data from the regional cancer registry morbidity rather than mortality data and data on trace element to examine this link
since the latter are available for a km raster the registration data are assigned to these grid square using the o grid reference
a with any such study there are the usual problem of ecological analysis and influence of migration together with issue of separating out the risk factor under investigation from possible confounding factor
in the usa morrill report on the beginning of a study into the possible radiation dos received a result of radiation release by the hanford washington state nuclear complex would seem to cry out for gi skill to be applied morrill
the research project will employ plume dispersion model in order to model dispersal by wind and will need to integrate this and other environmental data with detailed demographic record
to some extent this line of approach wa anticipated by johnson in his study of exposure to plutonium from the rocky flat nuclear weapon plant near denver see zeigler et al
using soil sample he constructed a contoured risk surface and then mapped excess cancer in various distance band detecting a marked distance decay effect
research problem and prospect
the work reviewed above suggests that the application of gi technique to hazard assessment emergency planning and environmental monitoring is both actually and potentially an important research area with many challenging problem
undoubtedly the gi of the will look very different from their rather primitive ancestor
computer power is becoming cheaper digital data more readily available and gi are becoming hybrid system involving other technology
in this last section we highlight some important research area a we see them
doubtless there are many others such is the surge of interest in gi technology
data availability
we should first consider the availability and quality of data concerning the population who may be at risk from the storage and transport of hazardous substance from toxic air pollution from flooding and so on
such data are crucial either for assisting the emergency service to make assessment about resource they need to deploy in such event or for estimate to be made of risk
within the public domain in the uk we must rely in general on data from the most recent population census the lowest level being that for enumeration district ed
a is well known rhind these contain on average perhaps household and people
the boundary ed have not been widely digitized unlike the electoral ward
however the centroid of ed are available a m grid reference and artificial ed polygon can be created if necessary
in some instance such data will suffice in many case they will have to suffice a nothing better is available
but in some area ed are very extensive physical unit and the shape will be quite distorted
furthermore the scale at which population estimate are often required mean that even ed are too coarse for risk assessment
for instance in performing it quantitative risk assessment the health and safety executive will rarely deal with distance from hazardous site in excess of km petts and census data will not offer sufficient resolution for accurate population estimate to be made
it should be pointed out however that the national radiological protection board currently us km grid square resolution population data from the census in it radiological protection study hallam et al
it would seem that despite the cost involved they should consider investing in the very detailed digital data pinpoint address code pac provided by pinpoint analysis ltd
this area of application would appear to be an obvious market for such a product
a useful research exercise would be to compare the use of census and pac data in deriving quantitative risk assessment and this is an interesting research problem
even with pac data some assumption would need to be made about number of person per household if good population estimate were to be made
more generally we need to consider the availability of large database for hazard study and emergency planning and this is an area ripe for major initiative
in the uk we seem to be lagging well behind the usa in the construction of database on hazardous site and especially hazard event such a those involving toxic release
for instance lioy and daisey in their work on the monitoring of toxic air pollution in new jersey construct what they term a microinventory for each of three town comprising the location of chemical plant metal processing plant paint spray manufacturer and so on
some attribute information is available for these
more closely linked to gi is work by mcmaster and johnson who perform a very detailed inventory of hazardous material both stored and transported in santa monica california
although the raster display are very crude it is simple to answer spatial query concerning the location of people for instance particular age group within certain distance of toxic hazard site
we have data on some hazardous site those regulated by cimah in the uk but a much more comprehensive approach should be adopted especially if we are serious in the search for environmental association with chronic disease
the same is true for toxic release
in the usa the environmental protection agency produce an acute hazard event database while the department of transportation ha a database recording detail of release of toxic material such detail include locational information type and amount of material released mode of release and resulting injury or death cutter and solecki
can we not use gi technology to construct risk mosaic zeigler et al at a variety of spatial scale akin to hewitt and burton hazardousness of a place
in the uk only a handful of county emergency planning department cumbria for instance have built up resource database in digital form and this need to be promoted
further afield we need to recognize that some disaster most obviously chernobyl will have implication for more than one country so that environmental monitoring should take place with some kind of international
there will also be movement of hazardous cargo across frontier and there are clearly problem of risk assessment and planning for emergency at or near international boundary or at sea and airport
a noted above the work of fedra is a major step in this direction and link need to be forged between initiative in the uk and the rest of europe
in term of database on hazardous waste attention ha already been drawn to the waste disposal plan prepared by wras
these give detail of present site location and some indication of permitted waste though little or no information on closed and abandoned site
however for detail of disposal the individual site licence must be consulted
the former hazardous waste inspectorate operated a large database on all site with detail of permitted waste including allowable quantity
the database wa created by a commercial company aspinwall ltd
there are numerous potentially usable database for environmental epidemiological work
opcs of course is a major data repository for medical statistic and their various monitor series are of use though only at the scale of district health authority and above see gatrell and lovett for an example
regional health authority will from time to time produce mortality data at ward level
however if cancer are of interest it is more appropriate to obtain data from regional cancer registry these data are morbidity rather than mortality data and are therefore more valuable
the data are postcoded and may have some occupational detail
for example we have received data from the regional cancer registry in manchester comprising all cancer of the larynx and lung notified between and
this large data set to which grid reference have now been added comprises information about nearly individual
it ha now been copied into ingres a relational database management system permitting query to be made about subset of the data for instance all male between the age of and suffering from laryngeal cancer
other data source on cancer are independent registry of malignancy
an example is that on leukaemia managed by the leukaemia research fund centre in leeds alexander et al
it should be noted that there are frequently major discrepancy between the regional registry and the specialist registry partly because the latter receive notification directly from consultant
indeed working directly with consultant prof invaluable in gaining access to morbidity data
two other potential source of data are worth mentioning
first attention should be drawn to the new directive from the department of health to regional and district health authority to review the health of the population
this mean in practice that district medical officer are charged with preparing an annual report presenting and interpreting epidemiological data identifying local health problem and evaluating service outcome
lancaster university is already heavily involved in the work of preston district health authority in this area
second family health service authority fhsas are also required to take on these role but from the viewpoint of primary health care service
fhsas which correspond to county and to metropolitan borough hold large database on service provided by general practitioner for instance uptake of immunization and screening for breast and cervical cancer
is it we wonder possible to contemplate bringing together some of these data source to form a national online health information system nohis to parallel that for employment and unemployment townsend et al
this might include data on morbidity and mortality uptake of preventative medicine service use and availability at both primary and hospital level
it would be a useful management tool particularly in view of the reorganization taking place in the national health service
it should not be forgotten that hazard themselves have geographical distribution yet there ha been little effort in the uk to develop public domain database
are there area
is there a regional differentiation in hazard type
these are of course commercially important question and a good deal of money is going into the collection of such data by insurance company
one well known database is major hazard incident data service mhidas global industrial hazard database which is currently being developed by the safety and reliability directorate on behalf of the major hazard assessment unit of the uk health and safety directorate
this system currently run in dbase ii and contains in excess of item of professionally assessed information on major hazard coded into some separate field
unfortunately the spatial referencing is poor and with some effort this could easily be remedied
it is for example little use when recording a chemical spill into an egyptian river to have entered into the appropriate field the nile after all this river is some km long
here in our view is a classic case of the absence of a geographical input rendering the data of limited value
in some case good hazard data exist but have simply not yet found their way into a gi
a case in point is inland and coastal flooding
most river authority have detailed map showing the geographical limit of flood in relation to their return period
within the next decade a the privatized water company develop their gi we shall see a massive amount of data conversion in this area
this development together with the availability of digital terrain model will allow quite sophisticated flood forecasting model to be developed within a gi framework
a rise in the next year due to the greenhouse effect this very practical use of gi technology is likely to become commonplace and of considerable practical importance
spatial statistic
another way in which there need to be a rapprochement between statistical method and gi is in the area of spatial sampling and estimation from spatial sample
this is clearly an important issue in radiation monitoring a the discussion of rimnet above implies
a an example peirson ha reviewed the evidence on artificial radioactivity in cumbria and show map of the distribution of certain radionuclides a contoured surface
the point worth making here is that there are many alternative scheme for interpolating from irregular point data lam
one method in particular kriging now available a part of the uniras software offer not only a contoured surface but also an estimate of the standard error at any point on the map
where this is high it suggests that an additional sampling station might be set up
such technique are now standard in environmental science see streit for an application to rainfall monitoring and need to be promoted vigorously in hazard study estes et al
related to this problem is that of making population estimate for new zone that result from overlay operation
we may want to count number living within plume circle of fixed radius buffer zone and so on
existing gi technique usually base the estimate on share so that a new polygon created by slicing an existing area in half is assigned half the population of that source unit
this may be quite absurd in some case notably where population is spatially clustered within a physically large ed
at the nwrrl work is under way flowerdew and green to solve such problem using the em algorithm and the statistical modelling package glim which ha been interfaced with
operation research method and simulation
while there is some research activity in linking statistical model to gi there would seem to be scope for further application of operation research technique to gi problem
within some sophisticated gi such a there are some useful algorithm such a shortest path calculation but gi developer have in general failed to realize the natural link between gi function and many operation research technique
over the last year or so a large theoretical literature ha been developed to provide tool for the solution of many problem associated with emergency planning kolesar
one important class of problem is the selection of location for the emergency service unit
the choice of location need not be for permanent base but can also include dynamic repositioning of unit a circumstance dictate kolesar and walker
in any major emergency a typical problem is the assignment of resource to demand
if resource are held at one set of location and the demand are at another and the cost of transportation are known how do we allocate the resource most efficiently
in a major emergency for example there might be a need to supply blood product held at regional blood bank to hospital
this of course is the classic transportation problem and it solution is well known
a far a we know the emergency response system devised by belardo et al is the only software to incorporate this algorithm
in this system the solution to the transportation problem is shown graphically on the road network which is displayed on the computer screen
a a last example of the potential role of operation research in gi and disaster management we are reminded of the logistic problem that faced the peel regional police force during the mississauga evacuation mentioned previously scanlon and padgham
during the early state of the phased evacuation the logistical problem facing the police wa the warning of the population to make ready for evacuation
speed wa of the essence and manpower wa limited
here then is a familiar operation research network problem all road have to be traversed such that the journey is a minimum
this is the chinese postman problem which provides a hamiltonian circuit through the arc a compared with the travelling salesman problem which is a minimum route through the network node
grant remains were shovelled into a canvas bag
tense facing outwards forster lawton and nell guarded delaney a he intoned the seaman prayer of interment and then committed the canvas bag to the ocean
the storm wa abating rapidly the evening sky clearing in the west with the golden ray of the setting sun adding a dying colour to the sullen slate blue water
the whiteness of the canvas dimmed beneath the onrushing sea faded at the edge then grew smaller greener and wa gone
they returned to the bridge fearful of every dark place every corner every door
the gangway lamp seemed to give no light only add further to the gloom of the dusk
back in the wheelhouse delaney faced them
right
you all know the score
a i see it we got two choice
one we get out of here now
launch the lifeboat take our chance or two we go after whatever it is
nobody spoke immediately
finally forster glanced at lawton for support and drawled laconically
i not leaving here until we done for that bastard
it personal from now on in
lawton nodded his agreement
yes he said i feel the same
nell
delaney asked looking at her squarely
i agree she said without hesitation
their tense edgy face watched delaney closely
we do know what we up against delaney said so let proceed with maximum caution
trouble is lawton said with a frown there are enough of u to search the ship
it can work it way past u and hide again
we could still be looking for it when they blow u out of the water
that why we got to take risk nell put in
lure it into a trap somehow
and quickly
forster chuckle wa mirthless
i do think this joker is going to need much encouragement
no
delaney wa momentarily thoughtful
what had you in mind nell
she pointed to the figure of a man propped in the corner and the cylinder of oxygen in the back pack lying beside it
two of our number have been killed
each time when they were on their own
let give it the same condition only this time we use that a the bait
they looked at the man forster had found
it wa a safety suit an advanced model of the nbc type with it own oxygen tank
one in ambush with the rest of u acting like beater
start at one end of the ship making a much noise a possible
forster grunted
it had no trouble finding grant
i think it a good idea
and i go in the suit until we reach the ambush point
might help to draw it
they helped him kit up nell connecting the lead from the back pack into the suit attachment
forster breathing whistled out of the valve
behind the clear wide vizor he tried to smile
cosy in here he joked
even got my own toilet
bloody handy in the circumstance
delaney took the lead
it wa now light the lamp on the gangway giving murky yellow pool that barely pushed back the inky blackness of a starless night
at the entrance to the laboratory complex the others drew on their own mask
ineffectual or not against lingering gas it seemed a wise precaution even if it wa only psychological
delaney glanced back at them
let make sure it know where we are
they made noise slammed door
nell shuddered
were unseen eye watching them
wa it even now shadowing them moving soundlessly from cover to cover like a tiger in the steel jungle
forster voice broke into her thought
look a good place
he wa at the entrance to the secure lab zone
this must be the only way in nell said
forster wa quickly
a they set up the now empty suit with it back to the door half slumped over a control panel he settled down behind the curtained entrance of the shower
delaney voice wa hushed
maybe we should leave two of u here
do want to rouse any suspicion
forster wa adamant
after all it might be able to count
when he did get any response he patted the uzi beside him on the steel floor
i wo be unprepared like poor old grant
delaney pulled the curtain across covering forster who cut a small slit in the opaque green plastic widening it to give himself a better field of view
lawton came and crouched down in front of it
i left the suit radio on full he said
make it sound interesting if we talk occasionally
he hesitated
good luck
i feel like a maharajah waiting for the tiger to pounce on the goat forster grinned
i hope i do have to wait all night
nell shuddered
night
this wa a night in their mind a creature from the darker side of man intellect
something worried her about that thought
something hidden behind the more obvious sentiment
after they gone forster felt the silence physically settle around him
he never been one to exercise an yet the condition were like the feeling of a tomb of an interment
would he be found he mused a thousand year from then a skeleton
he chuckled
and the uzi a primitive weapon the bio suit mistaken for some sort of ceremonial armour
the first stunning silence gave way to the creaking of the ship and a booming of the sea against the hull
the radio on the dummy suddenly screeched into action a delaney distorted voice gave it life
the thousand of ton of steel made real communication impossible
his own radio wa off
forster settled down only putting his eye to the slit every half minute not continually a he had started to do
he had a good view of the long shadowy main corridor
the only problem wa if he corrected himself when it came which side turning if any would it use
the further away the better
the more time to see it approach
the trouble wa the transverse corridor just outside the room
if the approach wa that way he would get no warning at all and it would be on top of george his name for the dummy sitting like a drunken before he knew it
if that happened he have to work fast
what he seen done to grant made forster realise that whatever it wa struck with demonic speed and savagery
or on him
a if in protest george uttered a cackle and fell fractionally forward
forster suppressed a nervous giggle
they reached the main deck dropping down
in a defensive posture eye searching the stacked container trying to probe the black jagged recess between them
lawton scanned upwards
it could be anywhere
even back on the bridge again
we should start in the engine room nell suggested shivering work up through the crew quarter and then into the complex
confronted with the need to proceed
delaney took risk plummeting foot first through the hatchway and partly breaking his descent with the handrail falling like a parachutist rolling instantly deploying his uzi against
against what
like forster all he could guess wa that it wa fast
grant may have been lame but fast or silent
or both
the speed of descent must have cut down the exposure to any residual gas since he felt none of the earlier weirdness a he approached the still sealed engine room door
pandora box
he winced at the memory a he hammered on the steel and then looked through the spy port
in the stroboscopic view the giant piston were the only thing moving until a figure detached itself from the wall it grey colour exactly that of the background steel
like a chameleon it moved out of the aisle between machine then stopped and became utterly motionless
delaney stillness caught the attention of the others
nell transceivered voice crackled in his headphone
what is it
he did want to take his eye from it equally he wanted somebody else to see it
to confirm
gently a though he might disturb it he pulled back
take a look for yourself
she did and caught her breath
the creature wa absurdly so it body half man half something lost in the primordial past
but there could be no doubt that fundamentally it wa human
nell knew and not only because she wa a female of the same specie
she could see in it eye intelligence
and human fear
but also a a doctor she knew exactly what it wa
she told delaney who shook his head with revulsion
nell would never rest until she could get closer to confirm her worst suspicion and paradoxically it wa the woman in her that provided the intensity of emotion that would let nothing stand in her way
george the sacrificial dummy had emitted a squeak for a long time
forster scanned the corridor once more
it wa empty
just a it always had been
he sat back again eyeing the blank wall before him confident that he catch it however good it wa
he kept wondering how it had got silk
silk wa the meanest toughest professional he ever known
and yet he disappeared without trace
forster wa a fatalist
he shrugged
you could be james bond he thought but if something had your number on it
a gentle breeze broke the absolute silence moving the curtain so that he had to steady it with his hand
instantly alert forster checked through his spy port
nothing
but a door had opened somewhere
somebody or something had entered the complex
it could be the others returning or the start of his ambush
for god sake leave your mask on
and that an order
but delaney plea wa in vain
nell pulled it off got close to the door and shouted
we mean you no harm
you can help u
when she checked through the spyhole it wa standing in exactly the same spot unmoving like a lizard
lawton shook his head
ca hear you
try the ship system again
nell ran to the wall telephone and pushed the digit for engine room
the small light beneath the receiver rest showed that the line wa working
worried delaney followed searching her face fearing the sign of toxicity
on impulse and against his better judgment he pulled off his own mask
nell repeatedly pressed the button shouted across at lawton who wa now using the spy port
what happening
the back of lawton head shook his voice crackling
nothing now
the head jerked just the once to the left so i reckon it heard the phone
he straightened up and came over directing his question at delaney
we ought to get on
delaney nodded his agreement
leave it nell
his tone wa sharp
it not going anywhere
she squared up to him defiantly
i ca john
do you see
the poor thing is part of this madness
if we can get to it i can learn so much more
and in any case it might die if we do try and help it soon
delaney averted his gaze from her afraid of what he had seen in her eye
perhaps it would be better if it did
you do mean that she said stepping away from him
delaney fiddled awkwardly with his mask preparatory to putting it back on again
for god sake nell
all i mean is we got a job to do
and forster neck on the line
do you owe it to him to come now
she flushed but held on to the phone
obviously striving to be a controlled a possible she smiled
you two can manage she said calmly
i can do better here on my own
quietly
if i succeed it will unlock a lot of the mystery of what been done on titron
and
she faltered
i think we owe it to that pathetic creature in there
pathetic
delaney tried to play down the fear in his voice fear for her
it might be bloody dangerous
certainly something on this ship is
not this one nell said shaking her head with some kind of reassurance
i just know
lawton gestured in the gangway
you may not be at risk from what is in here
what about out there
there no guarantee that what we hunting is going to follow the rule
nell shrugged
that a risk i have to take
i got a more important job here
delaney knew there wa no way she would be shifted from her chosen course
ordering her would be ludicrous under the changed circumstance and in any event a waste of time
but lawton wa right
the risk from the other danger or danger of titron frightened him more
help me secure the stair behind u he snapped at lawton a much a we can
delaney turned to nell
it might buy you the time you need
but take care
do be bloody foolish like i am leaving you here
establish contact if you can
no more at this stage
understand
and do try and get the door open
but nell wa hardly listening
to please him she nodded then despite lawton presence squeezed delaney arm
and you
she smiled
watch out
reluctantly delaney made for the gangway
lawton had already shifted some chair in readiness to form a barricade
he gave him a hand with a large oil drum and then another a nell tearing herself from her appointed task dragged over a bench
a they drew back up the stair piling on the piece she threw up at them lawton sniffed
this wo hold anything
just slow it down
like forster before her nell indicated her pistol and grenade
a long a there ti me that all we need
a they descended the stair delaney paused and took a last look down at her
she smiled shyly then turned away
in a sense a long a he could convince himself that she wa safe he wa glad she wa coming with them
whatever it wa they were after it wa an unknown quantity unknown that is except for a lethal ferocity
he pulled on his respirator his mind made up to get back to her a soon a he could for nell anderson wa all he cared about now
there it went again
forster frowned a he looked through his spy hole
a sound
he could place it but it reminded him strongly of something
the corridor wa empty
it had happened three time now
a hissing we gas escaping ending with a funny little squeak
he looked at george wondering if the sound had come from him
satisfied that everything wa a it should be he checked his watch
well over half an hour had passed
they ought to be near him soon
forster searched in a pouch and came up with a glucose sweet
quietly he unwrapped the covering paper then paused a some instinct made him check again
a he did so the sound came nearer louder
his intense scrutiny took in the shadowy and empty length of the corridor
apart from some dark patch on the wall that he had noticed before there wa nothing to see
his gaze came back to george still sprawled over the control desk
a fly landed on the empty staring vizor and crawled across it
forster wa sorely tempted to nip out and confirm that the noise wa coming from george by twiddling the volume and tuner but fought down the urge
he sat back pulled off his mask and popped the sweet into his mouth
it took him only second to notice the smell
forster choked a the putrefying reek seemed to get right into him
frightened that it wa a gas pocket he fumbled with his mask and finally got it back on
his heart wa thumping
nothing seemed to be happening all his sens were apparently functioning normally except that the sweet in his mouth seemed permeated with the awful smell had become a slimy lump of filth
he had to get rid of it
forster reached for his mask just a the hissing gas noise sounded right on top of him ending with a little shriek
he knew then where he heard something similar before
it wa like a man breathing through a respiratory system with some sort of valve
a shadow fell across the wall opposite a slowly and fearfully he turned
the curtain wa a dense opaque and something wa right behind it a shape pressing against the humped plastic standing there looking down at him half seen half imagined
his hand went out reached for the submachine gun his finger tightening on the stock
with a growl the curtain wa snatched aside
forster half rolled his uzi trembling in his hand a he got off half a clip at point blank range
but it struck with the speed of an attacking snake
and something else something he saw a the curtain tore away and he looked into the depth of the unbelievable face above him fractionally dulled his reflex
friday september to tuesday september
once free of the knotted tentacle of the eastern suburb dalgliesh made good time and by three he wa driving through lydsett village
here a right turn took him off the coastal road on to what wa little more than a smoothly macadamed track bordered by ditch and fringed by a golden haze of reed their lumbered head straining in the wind
and now for the first time he thought that he could smell the north sea that potent but tang evoking nostalgic memory of childhood holiday of solitary adolescent walk a he struggled with his first poem of his aunt tall figure at his side binoculars round her neck striding towards the haunt of her beloved bird
and here barring the road wa the familiar old farm gate still in place
it continued presence always surprised him since it served no purpose that he could see except symbolically to cut off the headland and to give traveller pause to consider whether they really wanted to continue
it swung open at his touch but closing it a always wa more difficult and he lugged and half lifted it into place and slipped the circle of wire over the gatepost with a familiar sensation of having turned his back on the workaday world and entered country which no matter how frequent his visit would always be alien territory
he wa driving now across the open headland towards the fringe of pine tree which bordered the north sea
the only house to his left wa the old victorian rectory a square building incongruous behind it struggling hedge of rhododendron and laurel
to his right the ground rose gently towards the southern cliff and he could see the dark mouth of a concrete pillbox undemolished since the war and a seemingly indestructible a the great hulk of concrete remnant of the old fortification which lay in the sand along part of the beach
to the north the broken arch and stump of the ruined benedictine abbey gleamed golden in the afternoon sun against the crinkled blue of the sea and breasting a small ridge he glimpsed for the first time the topsail of larksoken mill and beyond it against the skyline the great grey bulk of larksoken nuclear power station
the road he wa on veering left would lead eventually to the station but wa he knew seldom used since normal traffic and all heavy vehicle used the new access road to the north
the headland wa empty and almost bare the few straggling tree distorted by the wind struggled to keep their precarious hold in the uncompromising soil
and now he wa passing a second and more dilapidated pillbox and it struck him that the whole headland had the desolate look of an old battlefield the corps long since carted away but the air vibrating still with the gunfire of battle while the power station loomed over it like a grandiose modern monument to the unknown dead
on his previous visit to larksoken he had seen martyr cottage spread out beneath him when he and his aunt had stood surveying the headland from the small top room under the cone of the mill
but he had never been closer to it than the road and now driving up to it it struck him again that the description cottage wa hardly appropriate
it wa a substantial house standing to the east of the track with wall partly flint and partly rendered enclosing at the rear a courtyard of york stone which gave an uninterrupted view over fifty yard of scrub to the grassy dune and the sea
no one appeared a he drew up and before lifting his hand to the bell he paused to read the word of a stone plaque embedded in the flint to the right of the door
in a cottage on this site lived agnes poley protestant martyr burned at ipswich august aged year
ecclesiastes chapter verse
the plaque wa unadorned the letter deeply carved in an elegant script reminiscent of eric gill and dalgliesh remembered his aunt telling him that it had been placed there by previous owner in the late twenty when the cottage wa originally extended
one of the advantage of a religious education is the ability to identify at least the text of scripture and this wa one which it needed no effort of memory to recall
a a delinquent at his prep school he had once been required by the headmaster to write out in his best handwriting the whole of the third chapter of ecclesiastes old gumboil economical in this a in all matter believing that writing line should combine punishment with literary and religious education
the word in that round childish script had remained with him
it wa he thought an interesting choice of text
that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been and god requireth that which is past
he rang and there wa only a short delay before alice mair opened the door
he saw a tall handsome woman dressed with careful and expensive informality in a black cashmere sweater with a silk scarf at the throat and fawn trouser
he would have recognized her from her strong resemblance to her brother although she looked the elder by some year
she took it for granted that each knew who the other wa and standing aside to motion him in she said it good of you to be so accommodating mr dalgliesh
i afraid nora gurney is implacable
once she knew you were on your way to norfolk you were a predestined victim
perhaps you would bring the proof through to the kitchen
it wa a distinguished face with the widely spaced eye beneath straight brow a rather secretive mouth and strong greying hair swept upwards and curled into a chignon
in her publicity photograph she could he recalled look beautiful in a somewhat intimidating intellectual and very english mould
but seen face to face even in the informality of her own house the absence of a spark of sexuality and he sensed a reserve made her seem le feminine and more formidable than he had expected and she held herself stiffly a if repelling invader of her personal space
the handshake with which she had greeted him had been cool and firm and her brief smile wa surprisingly attractive
he knew that he wa oversensitive to the timbre of the human voice and hers although not jarring or unpleasant sounded a little forced a if she were deliberately speaking at an unnatural pitch
he followed her down the hall to the kitchen at the back of the house
it wa he judged almost twenty foot long and obviously served the triple purpose of sitting room working place and office
the half of the room wa a kitchen with a large gas stove and an aga a butcher chopping block a dresser to the right of the door holding an assortment of gleaming pot and a long working surface with a wooden triangle sheathing her assortment of knife
in the centre of the room wa a large wooden table holding a stoneware jar of dried flower
on the wall wa a working fireplace the two recess fitted with bookshelf
to each side of the hearth wa a wicker armchair in an intricate closely woven design fitted with patchwork cushion
there wa an open desk facing one of the wide window and to it right a stable door the top half open gave a view of the paved courtyard
dalgliesh could glimpse what wa obviously her herb garden planted in elegant terracotta pot carefully disposed to catch the sun
the room which contained nothing superfluous nothing pretentious wa both pleasing and extraordinarily comforting and for a moment he wondered why
wa it the faint smell of herb and newly baked dough the soft ticking of the clock which seemed both to mark the passing second and yet to hold time in thrall the rhythmic moaning of the sea through the door the sense of ease conveyed by the two cushioned armchair the open hearth
or wa it that the kitchen reminded dalgliesh of that rectory kitchen where the lonely only child had found warmth and undemanding uncensorious companionship been given hot dripping toast and small forbidden treat
he placed the proof on the desk refused alice mair offer of coffee and followed her back to the front door
she walked out with him to the car and said i wa sorry about your aunt sorry for you i mean
i expect that for an ornithologist death cease to be terrible once sight and hearing begin to go
and to die in one sleep without distress to oneself or inconvenience to others is an enviable end
but you had known her for so long that she must have seemed immortal
formal condolence he thought were never easy to speak or accept and usually sounded either banal or insincere
hers had been perceptive
jane dalgliesh had indeed seemed to him immortal
the very old he thought make our past
once they go it seems for a moment that neither it nor we have any real existence
he said i do think death wa ever terrible to her
i not sure that i really knew her and i left wishing i tried harder
but i shall miss her
alice mair said i did know her either
perhaps i should have tried harder too
she wa a very private woman i suspect one of those fortunate people who find no other company more agreeable than their own
it always seems presumptuous to encroach on that
perhaps you share it
but if you can tolerate company i having a few people mostly colleague of alex from the power station to dinner on thursday night
would you care to join u
seven thirty for eight
it sounded he thought more like a challenge than an invitation
somewhat to his surprise dalgliesh found himself accepting
but then the whole encounter had been a little surprising
she stood regarding him with a serious intensity a he let in the clutch and turned the car and he had the impression that she wa watching critically to see how he handled it
but at least he thought a he gave a final wave she had asked him whether he had come to norfolk to help catch the whistler
three minute later he raised his foot from the accelerator
ahead of him trudging along on the left of the path wa a little group of child the eldest girl wheeling a pushchair with two smaller child one each side of her clutching the bar
hearing the noise of the car she turned and he saw a peaked delicate face framed with hair
he recognized the blaney child met once before with their mother walking along the beach
obviously the eldest girl had been shopping the folding pushchair had a shelf under the seat lumped high with plastic bag
instinctively he slowed down
they were unlikely to be in real danger the whistler stalked at night not in broad daylight and no vehicle had passed him since he left the coastal road
but the child looked grossly overburdened and ought not to be so far from home
though he had never seen their cottage he seemed to remember that his aunt had told him that it lay about two mile to the south
he recalled what he knew about them that their father earned a precarious living a a painter whose innocuous prettified watercolour were sold in and tourist shop along the coast and that their mother had been desperately ill with cancer
he wondered whether mr blaney wa still alive
his instinct wa to pile the child into the car and drive them home but that he knew wa hardly sensible
almost certainly the eldest child theresa wa it had been taught not to accept lift from stranger particularly men and he wa virtually a stranger
on an impulse he reversed the jaguar and drove quickly back to martyr cottage
this time the front door wa open and a swathe of sunlight lay across the floor
alice mair had heard the car and came out to him from the kitchen wiping her hand
he said the blaney child are walking home
theresa is wheeling a pushchair and trying to cope with the twin
i thought i could offer a lift if i had a woman with me someone they know
she said briefly they know me
without another word she went back into the kitchen then came out to him closed the front door after her without locking it and got into the car
putting it into gear his arm brushed her knee
he wa aware of an almost imperceptible withdrawing more emotional than physical a small delicate gesture of
dalgliesh doubted whether that recoil had anything to do with him personally nor did he find her silence disconcerting
their conversation when they did speak wa brief
he asked is mr blaney still alive
no
she died six week ago
how are they managing
not particularly well i imagine
but ryan blaney doe welcome interference
i sympathize
once he let down his defence half the social worker in norfolk amateur and professional will move in on him
when they drew up beside the little band it wa alice mair who opened the car door and spoke
theresa here is mr dalgliesh to give you all a lift
he miss dalgliesh nephew from larksoken mill
one of the twin had better sit on my lap
the rest of you and the pushchair can fit into the back
theresa looked at dalgliesh without smiling and said a grave thank you
she reminded him of picture of the young elizabeth tudor the same hair framing a curiously adult face both secretive and the same sharp nose and wary eye
the face of the twin softer edition of her own turned towards her questioningly then broke into shy smile
they looked a if they had been dressed in a hurry and not very suitably for a long walk on the headland even in a warm autumn
one wore a tattered summer dress in pink spotted cotton with double flounce the other a pinafore over a checked blouse
their pathetically thin leg were unprotected
theresa wa wearing jean and a grubby sweat shirt with a map of london underground across the front
dalgliesh found himself wondering if it had been brought back from a school trip to the capital
it wa too large for her and the wide sleeve of limp cotton hung from her freckled arm like rag thrown over a stick
in contrast to his sister anthony wa a bundle of legging jumper and a padded jacket topped with a woollen helmet with a bobble pulled well down over his forehead beneath which he surveyed their busyness unsmiling like a stout imperious caesar
dalgliesh got out of the jaguar and tried to extricate him from the pushchair but the anatomy of the chair momentarily defeated him
there wa a bar beneath which the child rigid leg were obstinately stuck
the solid uncooperative bundle wa surprisingly heavy it wa like trying to manoeuvre a firm and rather smelly poultice
theresa gave him a brief pitying smile dragged the plastic bag from beneath the seat then expertly freed her brother and settled him on her left hip while with the other hand she collapsed the pushchair with a single vigorous shake
dalgliesh took the baby from her while theresa helped the child into the jaguar and commanded with sudden fierceness sit still
anthony recognizing incompetence grasped dalgliesh hair firmly with a sticky hand and he felt the momentary touch of a cheek so soft that it wa like the fall of a petal
throughout these manoeuvrings alice mair sat quietly watching from the car but made no move to help
it wa impossible to know what she wa thinking
but once the jaguar had moved away she turned to theresa and said in a voice of surprising gentleness doe your father know that you out alone
daddy ha taken the van to mr spark
it due for it mot test
mr spark doe think it going to pas
and i found we run out of milk for anthony
we have to have milk
and we wanted some more disposable nappy
alice mair said i giving a dinner party on thursday evening
if your father agrees would you like to come and help with the table like you did last month
what are you going to cook miss mair
put your head close so that i can whisper
mr dalgliesh is going to be one of the guest
i want it to be a surprise
the pale golden head leaned forward towards the grey and miss mair whispered
theresa smiled and then nodded with serious satisfaction in a moment of grave feminine conspiracy
but next morning ruth awakened early and leaving miss beard to her gentle dream dressed quickly and hurried out of the house
it wa another golden day
she still retained her english habit of noting each day weather always expecting change marvelling at the hot sunny day which followed one after the other almost with monotony
when she reached the plateau she remained standing watching for joss barnet waiting for the moment when she would see him riding towards her
there wa no longer any need for her to be
discovered
her sole purpose in being there wa to meet him and she wa content that he should know it
he wa late this morning
or wa she earlier than she thought
had she misjudged the time
no matter
she wa happy to wait for him certain that soon she would see him riding towards her
then a the minute passed and there wa no sign of him she considered that perhaps he had overslept
it could happen
or had his horse gone lame cast a shoe
she sat down and prepared to wait a long a wa necessary
she knew that in the end he would come
after a few more minute she became restless and stood up again her eye searching the slope of the hillside and the valley below trying to determine whether some small movement down there wa a man on horseback or merely a trick of her imagination
should she set off down the hill to meet him
but perhaps he would come by another route and then she would miss him
at the end of what she reckoned must be an hour she faced the fact that he wa not coming
she dropped to the ground again and lay down burying her face in the grass
she had been mistaken ever to think that he would come
she had let her overwhelming desire feed her imagination had read something into his word his look his action which had not been there at all
her face burned with the shame of it
such wa the feeling joss barnet had aroused in her that not for one moment did it occur to her to blame him for anything
it wa all her fault
sick at heart she wept
then she dried her eye on the hem of her petticoat and went slowly back to the house
so you decided to put in an appearance
cook said
i do seem to recall something about you offering to help me with the party preparation
but of course if you changed your mind
i have ruth snapped
i ready to start now
i do want any breakfast

what the matter with everyone this morning
cook demanded
there sean and the master left in a hurry this hour past for new york city both without a bite inside them and now you
gone to new york
that what i said
with mr cranbrook word ruth appetite immediately returned
so he had not failed her after all
how could she have thought that he would
something unforeseen and urgent had happened since sean had obviously known of it yesterday afternoon and there had been no opportunity for him to inform her
relief surged through her like a physical infusion of new blood
i changed my mind she said
i would like some breakfast
suddenly i hungry
when will they be back
sean
how should i know
i do understand business
what i do understand is that if the master not home for the party tomorrow the mistress wo be pleased and that putting it mildly
do you dawdle over your breakfast then not if you intend to make yourself useful
there plenty to be done
ruth worked all that day a though she had the strength of ten
they prepared chicken pie the pastry a light a ruth heart turtle soup a haunch of venison jelly blancmange syllabub trifle and a host of other dish with still more to be done on the day of the party itself
mr cranbrook unbent so far a to show approval
you done very well she conceded
mr carson knowing how much wa involved had excused ruth from all other duty until anna bedtime hour
and now it approached
she took off the voluminous apron cook had lent her and went in search of her charge
anna wa in tear
we going home she sobbed
i do want to go back to mr gutermann
i want to stay with edward
i want to live with him for ever and ever
ruth could think of few worse fate but her stomach lurched at the thought of leaving millfield
how do you know we leaving she asked
who told you
miss fitch anna wailed
i do like miss fitch
i hate her
i daresay she want me to go
perhaps she mistaken ruth said though she doubted if miss fitch wa ever wrong
we ask your mama the moment she come in
i afraid it true mr carson told them
of course we were only invited for ten day or so
ruth had lost count of time
to her the long summer day had stretched ahead world without end
we are going to leave on sunday mr carson went on
not too early in the day since i daresay we shall all be tired after tomorrow party
anna tell me she never want to leave edward ruth said after the child had gone to sleep
mr carson smiled indulgently
dearest anna
she a little young for a holiday infatuation but we all have them sooner or later
thank goodness they never last
and the more intense they are the shorter the duration so anna should soon be over it
will mr barnet be back for the party
ruth asked
i expect you mean will be back mr carson said
and the answer is i do know
mr barnet tell me that she expects her husband when she see him
it a fact that american men seem to put business before everything
thank goodness englishman are not like that
next morning ruth wa down in the kitchen early eagerly hoping to find sean there
he could well have returned late at night and she not heard him though she had stayed awake for a long time listening for the sound of the horse the carriage wheel on the drive
there wa no sign of sean but mr cranbrook wa already at work
i hope you ready to help me she said
everybody is busy with this and that a if food wa the most important thing
i help mr cranbrook ruth agreed
they not back then
she tried to sound nonchalant
not back
oh you mean and the master
not that i know of
there no telling when they u return
sometimes they gone for three or four day at a time
but surely with the party
mr cranbrook shrugged
he a law unto himself the master
not for the like of you and me to question why
the heart had gone out of the day
ruth fetched and carried and stirred and whipped praying every moment that joss barnet would return before they left millfield next day
but when the day had dragged to evening in spite of all there wa to do the time now passed slowly and still there wa no sign of the two men she began to lose hope
in the evening she left the kitchen and went to put a reluctant anna to bed
then she turned to helping mr carson
she brushed her mistress hair and piled it on top of her head in a cluster of curl carefully and meticulously arranged to look quite casual
it wa a style ruth had devised herself and mr carson wa delighted with the result
it look so different she said
you really are quite clever at this ruth
and now for my dress
she looked beautiful in the yellow satin the bodice tight against her slight figure the skirt billowing out
but ruth had no heart either to appreciate or to envy her mistress
her spirit were at their lowest ebb
mr carson gave her maid a sharp compassionate look
she thought she knew the cause of this mood and in a way she wa glad to see it
at least it showed that the girl mind wa working in the right direction
do worry ruth she said kindly
i dare say will be back tomorrow before we leave
and if not there is always new york when the barnets return in the fall
and now i sha need you again this evening so apart from looking in on anna from time to time you may do just a you please
had she not been so downhearted ruth would have enjoyed herself
but she had given up all hope of joss barnet returning that evening and nothing else in the world mattered
the party scene wa pretty enough
coloured lantern hung in the tree which fringed the lawn and bordered the lake beyond
torchlight flaring against the night sky and reflected in the water had been set up wherever it wa suitable
already the orchestra had begun to play and the elegantly dressed to appear
ruth had no heart for it
she climbed the stair to her room then undressed and went to bed wetting the pillow with her tear which held back all day now flowed unchecked
her only comfort wa not to have miss beard in her room to be able to suffer in solitude
though she thought sleep would never come eventually it did
she fell asleep to the sound of music drifting upwards from the
when she wakened it wa still dark the orchestra still playing though it wa not that which had aroused her
penetrating her sleep she had heard the faint click of the door latch and then the familiar squeak of the hinge a the door to her room slowly opened
she raised herself on one elbow blinking her eye trying to see in the darkness
but enough light came from the landing on to which the door opened to silhouette the man standing there
it wa joss barnet
shock made her cry out and he closed the door and moved towards her in quick stride putting his hand across her mouth to scream
then he sat on her bed and without a word from either of them she went willingly into his arm and wa held close in his embrace
she felt his heart beating strong and fast against hers
they stayed like that for a long moment and then he said light the candle
i ca she whispered
someone will see the light under the door
no matter if they do he said
they will not think of me here
only my coachman know i am home
i have not yet joined the party
you came to me first
she could hardly believe it
he would not tell her this funny bewitching little english girl that he had come to her first because he could not keep away from her
she had been on his mind since the morning he had seen her from his horse frightened yet defiant sparking with anger
almost but not quite she had come between him and the work he had had to do in new york city
the moment the work wa done he had ordered his coachman to drive him back to millfield a fast a the horse would go
light the candle he repeated
ruth finger trembled a she obeyed him
then she lay back on her pillow and they looked at each other a if it wa for the first time
he traced the contour of her face with gentle finger outlining the curve of her mouth stroking her temple
without any hurry in spite of the impatience which had brought him here he caressed the length of her neck and the slope of her shoulder
from out of nowhere ruth remembered dick parker but not this time the pleasure of her union with him only the pain it had brought her on the christmas eve following
and now although her whole body cried out for fulfilment and she longed for joss barnet to complete what he had surely come to do she knew that she must not let it happen
she turned her face away from him pushed his hand from her
no she cried
you must not
he gave not the slightest sign of having heard her continuing to stroke her neck and now inserting his finger under the neckline of her nightshift
she tried again to push him away
please
please do she cried
it wa surprise which made him stop for a second
he smiled at her an unexpectedly tender smile
i wo hurt you he said
do be afraid
i not afraid of being hurt
then what
i afraid of afterwards she said hesitantly
if i were to have a child
it would be the end of the world for me
but you wo he assured her
i see to that
i not totally callous
you promise
i promise
she lay quiescent and felt his strong finger quicker now move to unfasten the button of her shift one by one
and when he had undone her gown and had difficulty in lifting it over her head she raised herself from the pillow and helped him to take it off
then he pulled down the sheet which wa all the bedclothes she had needed on that warm night and she lay naked before him
she observed him without shame a he looked at every part of her
her pleasure wa in him and in his delight of her
when at last he stripped off his clothes and came into her it wa a if this wa the moment to which all her life had been leading
he wa a skilful lover tender and gentle in the beginning then powerful persistent rough almost until his passion rising in harmony with hers the climax came like the bursting of a thousand star like the beginning and ending of the world
afterwards they lay quietly side by side not speaking until he said i must go
not yet she begged
you ca leave me yet
she turned over and lay on top of him trying to pin him down with her own slight weight and he began to fondle her and she him and almost at once they were making love again
you are a sorceress he told her when it wa all over
an enchantress
woman a tempting a you should be kept out of the sight of mortal men
you not a mortal man ruth said
you a god
he laughed out loud
hush she cautioned
someone will hear you
i a real man all right he said
a i just proved to you
and would again if time allowed
then he stood up and quickly began to dress
i must go and do my duty a a host for what left of the night
do leave me she begged
please stay
he looked at her in surprise spoke brusquely
but of course i must go
there no question
long afterwards ruth realised that this wa the moment when she had learned that she could never come first with him
however much he might desire her she would have no more than the allotted space in his life
when am i going to see you again she asked
that also wa the wrong thing to say
i ca make plan he said sharply
but we leave tomorrow she exclaimed
that took him by surprise
the deuce you do
well i shall see to that
my wife will extend the invitation to the carson
i take it they not promised elsewhere
oh no ruth said
we going back to new york city
he finished dressing then came and held her by the shoulder kissing her lightly on the mouth
a he wa leaving he turned around and threw a small box on to the bed
from the city he said
you see that i had you in my mind
he wa out of the room before she could open the box a dark blue leather affair lined with white velvet against which lay a fine gold chain with a small oval locket set around the edge with seed pearl
she gasped in amazement
it wa without doubt the most beautiful thing she had ever owned or ever would
such delicacy such refinement
her finger trembling with excitement she fastened it around her neck
it should remain there for ever
she would never take it off
ellen and i lingered on in mama sipcott for another hour and a half indulging in the sailor shorebound pastime of planning the perfect voyage
we decided that masquerade would sail from the bahamas to panama and thence to the galapagos where we would find darwin giant tortoise
then we would sail south to easter island to explore the mysterious statue before going to the mutineer refuge on pitcairn island
after that we would go to tahiti and i saw the excitement grow in ellen a she realised that these plan were so close to coming true
it wa an excitement that matched my own for i had never sailed the south sea and i had long dreamed of that scatter of tiny magically named island strewn across one third of a globe
by the time we had drunk our third bottle of wine ellen and i had long reached new zealand and were already sailing north towards new caledonia
we were happy
we caught the bus back to ellen apartment and collected her clothes and notebook
she wa moving back on board wavebreaker in preparation for the next day early departure
i carried her luggage to the yard noting that even ellen strident feminism evaporated in the face of two heavy bag and tropical heat
once in the boatyard ellen ran ahead of me evidently eager to reach wavebreaker air conditioning
then a she reached the dock edge she suddenly checked
what on earth is that
oh no
she began to run again
when i reached the water edge i understood her dismay
a large boat wa moored alongside wavebreaker but moored so crudely that whoever had brought the powerboat alongside the schooner had not bothered to put out fender but instead had gouged long ugly gash in wavebreaker white paint
yet even the gash were not so ugly a the expensive boat that had caused them
there wa nothing wrong with the boat line which were sleekly functional but her long powerful hull her upperworks and even the interior of her capacious working deck had all been painted with a wartime dazzle paint
the seemingly random and pattern of blue black silver green and white had been designed to disguise a boat shape from the prying eye of captain so it seemed somewhat fanciful to thus camouflage a pleasure boat in the bahamas
this boat wa called dream baby and she wa clearly an expensive infant for rod and and outrigger splayed from her upperworks like the antenna of some outlandish insect
she boasted a harpoon walkway a flybridge and above the highest an aluminium canopy which held a radar aerial
the fighting chair on her aft deck had thick white leather strap giving it the appearance of a padded electric chair while the dazzle paint gave the boat an oddly military look that wa completed by the number that wa painted on her bow in black numeral like those warship use to display their commissioning number
the boat windscreen were made of black polarised glass which only added to dream baby ugly air of menace
ellen unencumbered with luggage had already reached wavebreaker and taken two plastic fender from a locker
she swung lithely down to dream baby gaudily painted deck and cushioned the two hull
how bad is the damage
i called down to her when i reached wavebreaker
it scraped back to bare metal
i give it some paint
wavebreaker hull wa made of steel and while such hull are marvellously strong and safe they are soon weakened if their steel is exposed to salt air
i had to paint the gash a soon a possible so that rust would not begin to bite into wavebreaker long sleekness
ellen looked around the oddly painted powerboat
you think someone rich enough to own a rig like this could afford a pair of fender
who care
just cut the damn boat loose i said vengefully
ellen ignored my advice while i obedient to the rule that if a job needed doing then do it without delay found a pot of white paint and dug through the locker for a clean brush
then from behind me an unfamiliar voice sounded oh ring my bell
it wa a man voice drawling and lazy
i twisted around and almost blinded myself by staring straight into the sun but then through the dizzying glare i made out the long silhouette of a tall man who seemed incongruously to be dressed in a long transparent dressing gown
he wa emerging in stately fashion from wavebreaker companionway and though i could see he wa tall and lanky and had a ponytail of hair i could make out no detail of his face
who the hell are you
i demanded
the man ignored me walking instead towards ellen who dressed only in short and wa climbing over wavebreaker rail
be still my restless heart the man had a strong caressing voice and the slow luscious accent of america deep south
dear lady dear lady to think that i might have lived my whole life through and never seen you
oh lay me down just lay me down
ellen usually so quick with a scornful reply just stood and stared at the elegant stranger who stopped one pace away from her took her hand then bowed above her finger
he kissed the air a fastidiously polite inch above her knuckle then closed his eye
dear sweet lord above i do thank thee for thy kindness in showing me this lovely woman before i died
to my astonishment and chagrin ellen left her hand in his a he opened his eye and smiled at her
my name he stroked her with his voice is jesse isambard sweetman
and who dear creature are you
ellen still said nothing
i had straightened up and moved aside so that the sun no longer dazzled me and i could see sweetman properly and what i saw i did not like
his face wa old and young sardonic and knowing amused and handsome the face of a man who ha seen the world wickedness and know how to match it with his own
his long black hair wa tied into it ponytail with a velvet ribbon his skin wa parchment pale and his eye dark
i put his age at forty but even among men twenty year younger he would have been accounted handsome and he knew it for his expression showed both confidence and amusement a he continued to hold ellen hand and he showed even more amusement when she suddenly realised just what liberty she wa thus granting him and jerked her finger swiftly away
thus released jesse sweetman turned to look at me
the dressing gown had proved to be a long stylish duster coat which wa loosely woven from a delicate white cotton
beneath the filmy topcoat he wore a black shirt and black trouser that were tucked into tall black boot
it wa a dramatic and impractical outfit of a kind i only expected to see on the male model who posed in the more outlandish fashion magazine that our rich client brought aboard wavebreaker yet jesse isambard sweetman managed to wear the elaborate style with an elegant insouciance
the only incongruous note wa a cheap round badge enamelled in red and yellow that he wore on his shirt which bore the legend just say no
you must be nicholas breakspear he said carelessly a though he did not much care whether i wa or not
is that gaudy piece of junk your boat
i gestured to where dream baby aerial showed above wavebreaker gunwale
sweetman turned and pretended to notice the boat for the first time
no he said helpfully then bestowed a patronising smile on me
you look so like your father
it really uncanny
did you bring that boat here
i persevered
oh indeed i did he said brightly a though he merely indulged a rather dim child curiosity
your mother wa malise fielding am i right
or are you lucy de sill son
why the hell did you use fender when you tied alongside
he sighed intimating what a bore i wa being
i did not use fender breakspear because i despise precaution
precaution are the symptom of small and fearful mind
precaution will not conquer empire they will not build great city they will not transmute dream into gold or carry men across wide ocean and precaution will not emphatically not win fair lady and here he turned to ellen and lasciviously dropped his gaze to her long bare leg
ellen twisted away and sweetman laughed at her obvious discomfiture then a coolly a though he owned wavebreaker he stepped down into the central cockpit where he first brushed at then sat on one of the white cushioned seat by the ship wheel
i had a look round the boat he said very coolly and i approve of her
so tell me the cost of a week charter
the man you want to see i said is called matthew mcillvanney and his office is the pink building with the outside staircase
he not here this afternoon but you can doubtless telephone him next week
sweetman took a pair of polarised sunglass from his shirt pocket and put them on before inspecting me again
he did not seem to like what he saw
you really not being noticeably helpful he said after a pause so let u try again shall we
would you please tell me the high season price for one week
how many passenger
ellen asked before i could refuse to answer
sweetman paused again this time to light a long pale blue cigarette with a slim gold lighter
he shrugged
two four six passenger
doe it really matter
one week in high season cost ten thousand u dollar for two people and every extra couple is another thousand buck
ellen voice wa cold a though she disliked satisfying his curiosity
and to those price you have to add the boat running cost
which are
sweetman asked carelessly
a lot
ellen said flatly
you talking fuel food and liquor plus any toy you might want aboard like scuba equipment snorkel or sailboards
sweetman drew on his fancy cigarette then blew a plume of smoke into wavebreaker rigging before smiling lazily at ellen
and tell me sweet creature do you count a a toy
or are you a part of the initial ten thousand dollar
get off the boat i said
shut up
he turned on me like a snake
you nothing but a hired hand breakspear so shut the fuck up
he glanced at the paint pot and brush that i wa still holding
go and paint something
be useful
he stared into my eye challenging me to defy him and when i did not move he looked back to ellen
i asked you a question dear heart
please be so good a to answer
get off this boat i told him but my anger only amused sweetman who unfolded his long thin leg from the cushioned thwart
dick off he said to me
i wa surprised that he so eagerly sought to confront me
i am not a small man nor am i a weakling yet the thin sweetman seemed unconcerned a i jumped down into the cockpit
then i saw why he wa so confident
he put a hand into a pocket of his elegant duster coat and brought out a small pistol that he pointed at my face
a lady gun he said but remarkably effective at close range
nick
ellen called warningly a though i might not have seen the gun
the gun threat had not stopped my advance
i wa calling sweetman bluff confident he would not dare pull the trigger and equally confident that my marine training would let me turn him into mincemeat
i wa also half drunk and thus filled with the dutch courage offered by mama sipcott worst white wine
sweetman stood
there wa at last a look of alarm on his face and i could see him wondering whether he really would have to pull the small trigger
he held the gun pointed at my eye
the picture very like the one rufus fletcher had taken in the summer of occupied the screen for about fifteen second
the whole item wa allowed no more than four time that in the bbc sunday evening news broadcast at
the other second were taken up by a policeman talking to a reporter about having nothing to say except that there would be an inquest
but shiva and lili manjusri saw the picture and so did rufus fletcher
adam unwinding in puerto de la cruz did not of course see it
he did not even see an english newspaper
they were expensive to buy and came a day late
he did not want to be reminded of home and the only paper he even glanced at wa the international herald tribune a copy of which anne found on the beach
his father at home in edgware said to his wife
good god wyvis hall a i live and breathe
beryl peered but the picture immediately vanished
yes i suppose it wa
the policeman talked the reporter trying to jog him into revelation and failing
in the background autumnal tree could be seen and a church on the summit of a low hill
lewis sat shaking his head le a a gesture of denial than of a generalized despair at the state of the world
it wa not that unpleasant memory were evoked for these were always with him his existence wa inseparable from that old bitterness but that a sight of the house even the glimpse of a photograph revived the precise feeling he had had why it must be getting on for eleven year ago
ten and a half said his wife
i shall have to get in touch with the police
no two way about it i shall have to get in touch with them
not this evening surely said beryl who wanted to watch mastermind
lewis said nothing
the room in which they were sitting underwent the curious shrinking process to which it wa subject whenever he wa reminded of wyvis hall or his uncle hilbert or even if the county of suffolk were mentioned
suddenly it grew small and poky
the brick of his neighbour house seemed to have moved itself four or five foot further towards the dividing fence so that it loomed offensively
lewis got up and pulled the curtain across with a pettish jerk of his hand
should you wait until adam get back
beryl said
why
what would that be in aid of
beryl meant that adam had been among the previous owner of wyvis hall while her husband had not but she knew better than to point this out
there is no one living know that lovely place better than
that true
i sha wait till adam return lewis said in that manner that had once led his daughter to call him the frog footman
but i shall wait until tomorrow
men and woman do not usually put their baser feeling and intention into word not even in the deep recess of their own mind
so lewis did not say even to himself when he wa privately considering trying to get hold of his son in tenerife that he disliked adam and would have been pleased to spoil his holiday
instead he rationalized his thought and justified himself adam probably indeed almost certainly knew nothing about the find in the pine wood but adam had once owned the house and had thus taken on a responsibility
he could not shed that responsibility just because he had sold the place
lewis would have agreed with oscar wilde that our past is what we are
we can not rid ourselves of it
therefore it wa adam duty to come home and face the music even though this might be no more than a short blast on a tin whistle
but he had no precise idea where adam wa and he did not think adam travel agent a personal friend of the young would tell him
some excuse would be made for not telling him
lewis bark anyway wa always worse than his bite
he had virtually no bite a he had once overheard adam say to bridget and heard it with helpless chagrin
a bloody good thing or our childhood would have been a misery instead of just a bore
lewis walked into his local police station in edgware on monday morning
they seemed surprised to see him but not astonished
the suffolk police had begun hunting up previous owner of wyvis hall and they had been alerted that a lived in their area
there were after all only two in the london phone directory
this might be a bonus
he wa asked to wait and then shown into a room where a detective sergeant prepared to take a statement from him
with busy pomposity lewis dictated it to a typist and would have gone on and on had he not been diplomatically restrained
wyvis hall nunes suffolk and the twenty acre of land surrounding it were the property through his marriage of my uncle hilbert
they came into the possession of my son hilbert john adam under my uncle will bypassing myself though my son wa no more than nineteen at the time of my uncle death
being an undergraduate at the time my son naturally never considered actually residing in the house
he wa in agreement with my suggestion that the property be sold and before he returned to college in the autumn of he took my advice and placed house and land in the hand of an estate agent
country property were not selling well at the time
wa the asking price and i wa not surprised that the sale so to speak hung fire
however in the spring of an offer wa made which my son accepted
this sale later fell through and it wa not until the following august that wyvis hall wa finally sold to a mr and mr langan for the much improved figure of
a far a i know my son personal acquaintance with wyvis hall wa confined to my uncle lifetime when my wife and son and daughter frequently stayed with him
after my uncle death in april he visited wyvis hall on perhaps two or at the most three separate occasion simply for the purpose of looking it over and reaching a decision about the disposal of furniture and effect
i suppose it is possible that squatter or other vagrant took possession of the house between the time of my uncle death and the sale of the property
certainly my son never let it or allowed anyone to occupy it on either a temporary or permanent basis
my son is at present on holiday in tenerife with his wife and daughter
i can not say precisely when i expect him to return though i should suppose in about a week from now
it wa all very small and quiet and
the snippet in rufus monday morning newspaper measured just an inch in depth
it answered the question he had asked himself and told him that the bone of a very young child had been found a well a those of a young woman
this wa not a shock
how could it be otherwise since this wa wyvis hall and the pine wood and the animal cemetery
to photograph the house for the news last night the cameraman must have stood just where he had stood himself on the edge of the lawn with his back to the cedar tree
a popular
camera he had used but quite a good one
one thing about zosie pilfering she never stole rubbish
he had taken a picture of her after that and one of the animal cemetery
why is the grass always so short up here
adam had asked
rabbit i expect
why ca bloody rabbit come and eat my lawn
adam always referred to my lawn my house my furniture
it had got up rufus nose a bit though adam had a perfect right to do this
it wa his all of it and it went to his head rather
seldom inherit country mansion after all
it must have been some time in august when i took those picture rufus thought and a couple of week later it wa all over
coincidentally a the community and their life together broke up so did the weather
it wa raining intermittently all the time they were in the cemetery the pine bowing and shivering in the wind
sometimes they had had to stop and take shelter under the closely
if the weather had held and still been hot and dry would they have dug deeper
probably not
in spite of the rain the earth wa still a hard a iron
a sheet of rain had come down then a hard gusty shower while they were laying the square of turf back in place and adam had said something about the rain making the grass grow quickly the rain being on their side
we should all go our separate way a soon a we can rufus had said
we should pack up now and go
the spade and the fork they had hung up among the other tool in the stable
they had packed and adam had locked up the house
at some point rufus himself had taken the thing out of the fridge and left the door open to defrost it
adam closed the front door and stood there for a moment a if he could not wrench himself away
so much of it beauty had been stripped from it by the whipping wind
and by the neglect of the long hot summer
a sudden gust of rain dashed against the red brick that were already stained in patch by water
the house that when he first saw it had seemed to float on a raft of golden mist now lay in a wilderness amidst ragged grass and straggling bush and tree dead from the heat
dirty grey cloud tumbled across the sky above the slate roof now the only thing that shone glazed with rain
but rufus admitted to himself that the beauty of nature and architecture had never meant much to him
it wa the heat and sunshine and privacy he liked
and now he longed only to get away
they all got into goblander and he drove away up the drift adam next to him the others in the back
the drift had become a tunnel of overgrowth that dripped water on to the roof of the van
none of them allowed their eye to turn towards the pine wood
at the top they came out into uncompromising bright grey light the bleak hedgeless lane the flat meadow where here and there stunted tree squatted like old men in cloak
adam simile not his thought rufus with a grimace
no one asked where he wa taking them
no one spoke
adam had hilbert old stuck between his leg and rufus guessed the gun wa inside it
they must have gone a good two mile before they met another car
rufus overtook a bus going to colchester and dropped the two in the back so that they could catch it
he took adam on to sudbury for him to catch a train there and at that point they parted
adam got down from goblander and said
for ever and for ever farewell rufus
which wa probably a quotation from something though rufus did not know what and thought fastidiously that it wa in bad taste histrionic though just like adam
take care said rufus and not looking back any more than he had done when they returned from the cemetery drove off round the town he had got to know so well over the stour bridge into essex heading for halstead and dunmow and ongar and london
he never had seen any of them again
there had been no need to pretend to turn aside
briefly starting his fifth year in medical school something over thirteen month later he had wondered if shiva manjusri would be one of the incoming freshman
but no his intuition had been accurate
at any rate shiva face wa not among the several brown face
a for the others avoiding them had presented no problem
would they get in touch with him now
no contingency plan had been made for this eventuality
so long a there wa no hunt for a missing girl they had felt themselves reasonably safe
their mind had not reached out to the terror of what had in fact happened
none of them had been the kind of people who could have imagined devotion to a pet animal or according to it funerary rite
it wa shiva who had proposed the site
they had congratulated him on his ingenuity
ten year
an ovarian cyst nothing to get upset about rufus told m beauchamp
she wa an editor with a distinguished publishing house married to an investigative journalist
a yet they had no child but she wanted four she told rufus
no reason why you should
he had another glance at her note
in fact a peculiarity about this condition is that it seldom if ever occurs in a woman who had a baby
my god she said putting her coat on
there wa making my husband life a misery sure i got the dreaded
they all thought they got the dreaded c poor thing
you could blame them
rufus took her off her by the reception desk having set in train the arrangement by which she would be admitted to a fashionable west end clinic with rufus her surgery and her hospitalization ultimately paid for by some provident association to which she and her husband subscribed
rufus shook hand
he walked back to his consulting room dying for a cigarette
this wa unlike him
he could usually get through quite easily until after lunch
he thought i know what my idea of heaven would be if by heaven we mean a place of bliss in which to pas eternity a sanctuary where one might without impairment of breathing destruction of the lung or damage to the heart light each fresh cigarette from the glowing butt of it predecessor and drink but chilled vodka laced with two drop of angostura and a gill of newly opened perrier endlessly with increasing euphoria until a peak of joy and ease wa reached but without any nausea or pain or dehydration or oblivion
sitting alone he lit his cigarette the first of the day and there came that faint swimming in the head a tautening of the gut
he closed his eye
if it come to light that i wa in that house with adam and the others he thought with cold clarity if someone tell the paper or the police and thence the paper that i wa there during the summer of living there it will be all up with me
i will lose my practice and my reputation and everything that i have and can look forward to if not my liberty
and without the rest i sha care about my liberty
it would be bad enough if i were a g p or an expert in some other branch of medicine an orthopaedic surgeon for instance or an ear nose and throat man but i am a gynaecologist and it is the bone of a young woman and a baby that have been found there
what worried woman would come to me
what mr strawson or m beauchamp
what gp would send her to me
if i were innocent thought rufus i know very well what i would do
i would pick up the phone and phone my solicitor and ask to come and see him and get his advice
he might advise me to make a statement to the police which i should of course do under his guidance
but i shall not do this because i am not innocent
i shall sit here and wait and sweat it out and look the fact in the face trying to anticipate the worst that can happen
the wonderful thing about the human mind adam thought is the way it cope when the worst happens
beyond that worst happening you think there can be nothing the unimaginable ha taken place and on the other side is death destruction the end
but the worst happens and you reel from it you stagger the shock is enormous and then you begin to recover
you rally you stand up and face it
you get used to it
an hour maybe and you are making contingency plan
for what had happened wa not the worst you realized that
the worst wa yet to come wa perhaps always yet to come never would actually come because if it did you would know it that would be reality and there would be nothing then but to kill yourself
quickly
now that he wa able to he assembled what had happened and laid the fact before himself
they had dug up those bone at wyvis hall and had decided it wa murder they were investigating
bone skeleton body do not bury themselves
those were the fact a far a he knew them up to this moment
he would know more much more in the day to come
what wa certain wa that he could no longer use the escape key
it wa defunct
the passage it cancelled had in any case a in certain programme not been lost but stored on some limbo disc from whence they must now be retrieved
adam sat in his parent house drinking tea
there must be a total retrieval now the one good thing about which wa that it might banish his dream
he wa aware of a slight feeling of sickness and of cold an absence of hunger though he had been feeling quite hungry when he got off the plane
anne sat next to him on his mother settee and abigail lay on a plaid rug on the floor kicking with her leg and punching with her arm
his mother kept poking toy which she did not want at her
a passage from a novel by john came back to adam
he had memorized it year ago in the ecalpemos epoch the safest way to live is first inherit money second be born without taste for liquor third have a legitimate job that keep you busy fourth marry a wife who will cooperate in your sexual peculiarity fifth join some big church sixth do live too long
apart from the last one which he had got to yet and the penultimate one which seemed to apply in america more than here here he had joined the golf club he had complied with all the rest
or his nature and luck had complied for him
nemesis had still come down like the wolf on the fold
he had not wanted to come back here
but there had been no spirit in him the shock of what his father told him had been too great
something that will interest you adam something to make you sit up
they dug up a lot of human bone at my old uncle house
by the time he had rallied and got himself together and wa thinking of thing to say to the police it wa too late and they were heading north
anne wa furious
when lewis said to come back with him and eat there adam had got a kick on the ankle from anne and another kick when he had replied
he had turned on her and said with cold savagery for fuck sake stop kicking me will you
he expected his father to rise and say something about that being no way to speak to one wife or not in front of the child he wa capable of that
but he had said nothing only looked subdued and adam realized why
his own terrible fear and anger had communicated itself to his father and shown him what the better part of valour wa keeping silent
having put the cat among the pigeon made mischief in his special way he wa lying low now and waiting
the old bastard
adam only wished uncle hilbert had left him wyvis hall and then there would have been no ecalpemos no zosie and no death
and adam could see he would have been much worse off
he and anne would be living in a house like this one rather than that palace
child after all he thought looking at abigail were happy wherever they were so long a they were loved
his parent had not asked him what sort of holiday he had had or how the flight had been
the conversation wa exclusively on the subject of the discovery at wyvis hall
adam did not know whether to be glad or sorry he had not obtained an english newspaper while away
if he had done the shock would have been le but on the other hand his holiday would have been spoilt
he would have liked very much to be alone
of course he knew there wa no possibility of this now or when he returned home for when you were married you never could be alone
presumably that wa the point
what wa he going to tell anne
how much wa he going to tell her
he did know
none of it if he could help it
they sat at the table in the dining area to eat an absurdly early high tea
lewis asked him if he could remember the day when he heard he had inherited wyvis hall and had walked in here and astounded them with his news
he had a beard then anne
lewis subdued air had changed to one of high good humour
you would have recognized him he looked like john the baptist
adam could remember very well but he wa going to say so
what a funny thing said lewis
we had ham salad that day too
what a coincidence
oh yes i been meaning to ask you who wa it looked after wyvis hall while you were in greece
adam could eat nothing
the other time he remembered it wa his father who had been able to eat
he did know what lewis meant about someone looking after the house but no doubt he adam had at the time concocted some tale to keep his father quiet to keep him away even
someone from the village you said lewis persisted
how can i remember that far back
the police will want to know
it may be of vital importance
are you going to eat your meat dear said beryl
abigail who had been put upstairs in one of the bedroom to sleep set up a wailing sound
adam wa on his foot at once
i think we should go
they had to wait until his father wa ready
adam would have preferred to phone for a hire car but lewis would hear of it
anne sat in the front in the passenger seat while adam wa in the back with abigail
if his father could have found out what flight they were coming on the police certainly could
it wa possible they might be waiting for him
they would wish to interview every former owner or occupant of wyvis hall
he looked again at the newspaper account of the adjourned inquest that his father had saved for him
it would be owner and occupant of wyvis hall between nine and twelve year before that they would wish to interview and those were hilbert who wa dead himself and ivan langan to whom he had sold the house
a for other occupant how would they know who else had lived there
it wa ironical that ten day before he had seen shiva at heathrow
the encounter he now saw a an omen a shadow cast by a coming event
what would that event be
adam did not want at this point to speculate it made feel sick
he turned the newspaper over so that he could not see that headline and those paragraph
in high spirit his father wa talking about the immense advance made in forensic science in recent year
a soon a they got home anne started getting abigail to bed
their case humped upstairs and put into the bedroom adam looked rufus fletcher up in the phone book
he wa in there twice at a wimpole street number and again at an address in mill hill rufus fletcher mb mrcp
all these year then or for some of them rufus had been living three or four mile from him
he could look shiva up because he could remember his surname
woman marry and change their name he thought there wa no point in pursuing that one
of course he could look up robin tatian but where really would that get him
he wa the blue directory when anne came back with abigail in her arm so adam took her and carried her back to bed himself and tucked her in and kissed her
she wa almost asleep
he wondered if rufus had child and if so did he worry about them coming to terrible harm the way adam worried
wa his whole life affected by what had happened at ecalpemos
adam might have escaped the file memory for year suppressed them and jerked violently away from them but he had never been able to pretend he wa unscathed by those event
sometimes he felt that he wa the person he wa because of them and acted the way he did because of their effect
he sat by abigail cot not wanting to remember but knowing that now he must
there wa nothing in his house to remind him of ecalpemos
everything that wa left everything he and rufus had sold had gone to ivan langan with the house
for a song too because he had not been able to bear the thought of going back meeting a valuer walking about the house picking thing off shelf and out of cupboard
only once had he returned after they all left and that had been bad enough like a dream no like stepping into the set and scenario of some frightening film a hitchcock movie perhaps
he asked the taxi he had taken to put him down at the top of the drift and he had walked to the house
it wa almost a year since he had been there and in that time nothing had been done nothing had been touched
from the pine wood he simply averted his eye till later
the drift wa thickly overgrown a dank tunnel out of whose bushy side the tendril of bramble and briar rose caught at his clothes
one of these whipped back at him and a he caught at it a thorn drove into the fleshy pad of his finger
that thorn had been there festering for month
a dull cool summer it had been a different a could be from the year before
no golden light bathed the red brick of the house
it no longer looked mellow
beautiful yes but severe somehow and to adam heightened awareness reproachful
he found himself encouraging fostering the scenario illusion
only thus only by pretending unreality pretending this wa a part he acted could he go on cross the wild shaggy grass go past the cedar tree arrive at the porch set in it four doric column and insert his key in the lock
conclusion
task analysis ha not and can not be reduced to a set of standardised procedure which the aspiring analyst could acquire in a formal training course
the technique just described are no more than guideline in what remains the creative art of studying and describing what an experienced worker is doing or will be required to do
the danger in being too rigid is that justice will not be done to the flexibility and complexity of human performance
the danger of being too flexible is that the ergonomists will have an inadequate basis from which to design interface training course and other operator aid
if a comprehensive task description can be completed then it is legitimate to enquire why the task can not be allocated to a technical device rather than a human being
yet without a reasonably comprehensive task description the total system performance may be unreliable or unpredictable
there is a necessary compromise which can only be arrived at in the context of a particular system
a mentioned earlier there are always the twin problem of how to get the information and how to present it
it is sometimes easier to proceed on the basis of if i were doing the job this is how i would do it but this can be delusory even for analyst who have past experience a operator
for analyst who are designer creating a new task there may be no alternative but any task description arrived at by this method should be checked against the behaviour of real operator a they gain experience
a particular difficulty about task synthesis is that there is no easy way of confirming completeness
a task description which is part of a design process should be fully documented in term of the origin of information the assumption made and the method used
the standard method of producing task description is to write all the separate at various level on card and then assemble the card in a network
there is a temptation to make these final diagram very large but often it is more useful to separate into small unit with
the optimum size seems to be this is easily copied and circulated but is large enough to contain considerable detail
the procedure can be computerised there are programme available for the easy production manipulation and storage of block diagram with useful facility
there is an inherent difficulty in that often the main dividend from a task analysis is from the act of obtaining it
those not involved find it difficult to gain very much from a presentation of a task description
like reference book they have to be used rather than read
task analysis can be very expensive in skilled manpower but in looking at it is important to include in value the increase in mutual understanding which occurs when a team conduct the analysis
if such a team is used the required can be optimised by using the delphi method rather than a long series of group meeting
political economic and social issue which arise in conducting task analysis are discussed in the context of job analysis
application
planning
the human resource concept of a the central asset of any organisation ha made some progress over the past twenty year
there wa particular interest around when company were prosperous stable and innovative ipm patten
the objective is to revise and almost reverse the traditional accountancy concept of a a resource consuming factor requiring regular payment overhead in the form of heated lighted equipped workspace and so on
from the narrow accountancy viewpoint people are a cost and it is desirable to keep this cost a low a possible
in these term it is very difficult to justify for example sending a member of staff on a training course
the training requires expenditure and so also doe the replacement for the person away
where is the return
the return is actually in the improved human resource but this is not readily measurable in term which accountant use
there have been two attempt to reduce human resource to this form of measurement giles and robinson
one is to acquire a human asset multiplier for each level of staff
the multiplier for manual staff might be unity but it increase with staff level and becomes three or more for management
the other is to add together all the personnel cost for each kind of worker from the original job advertisement through to the retirement or redundancy payment
the first doe attempt to obtain a value the second remains essentially a cost and not a value
it would be unduly optimistic to assume that management skill have risen to a level such that cost undertaken can be assumed to be equivalent to value
a le direct measure which is applicable only to the most senior management is to observe the fall or rise of the share price when a particular executive leaf or join a company
this can be very high for a large company a change in market value of million of pound is not unusual
the most serious consequence of the accountancy view of is that high level policy doe not give this factor sufficient weight
for example the main board of a company will have complete detail of cost and value of physical resource such a building and equipment but relatively scanty data about the which is their most important asset
indeed it will be described almost entirely a a liability because the cost will be known
similarly broad factor such a the state of morale will again only be described by negative feature such a absenteeism stoppage strike low quality output and so on
it is obvious that company output and project must reflect the and it performance level but if this is acknowledged at all it is only in brief verbal term within for example the chairman annual report
the obsession of current management with measurement and the reduction of every variable to number for ease of computer manipulation ha worsened the situation
unfortunately there is no easy remedy
human resource are too complex a variable to be easily susceptible to measurement beyond the level of counting head and trade
key variable such a the quality of staff at any level and the current morale are only expressible in general verbal descriptive term
it is generally accepted that hygiene type variable such a pay and working condition can if they are inappropriately specified depress morale and motivation but they will not in themselves result in very high level of these parameter
morale and motivation are influenced more by condition of work in the sense of work variety opportunity and attitude of management
these factor are worthy of emphasis because in practice they are still dealt with very badly in many organisation and yet it take little trouble or expertise to make an enormous difference
for example very few senior management take the trouble to keep worker fully informed about policy and likely change
the result is excessive reliance on rumour and continuous speculation which is not only but is also highly deleterious in morale term
the two human factor which can be unambiguously measured are age and sex
the age distribution of a work force is always an interesting and important source of information
for most purpose a rectangular distribution is the most desirable because it provides the appropriate mix of youthful enthusiasm and ageing experience
it also make for regular change a staff retire and are replaced
many distribution show a peak in a particular age group mainly associated with taking on a large number of young people when the organisation wa started or reorganised this is not desirable because it lead to excessive competition for promotion at particular stage
these comment are obviously most relevant for work force where there is little tendency to move out this is characteristic of a surprisingly large number of organisation in european country and in japan but much le so in the
stable work force have their advantage in term of familiarity with the enterprise and it peculiar need but they do result in problem if the market for the product is erratic or otherwise unpredictable
this is particularly so in high technology design and construction of ship aircraft power station and chemical plant where the product unit is large and expensive and the variety of required expertise is extensive
some peak of demand can be dealt with by using consultant but they tend to be expensive and do not always fit well with but important factor such a the favoured style of the organisation
in well ordered system it may be possible to calculate the length of experience required to achieve the required level of expertise in particular topic and compare this with the lead time for particular product requirement
given time available to train new staff it is not necessary to keep more than a nucleus in that particular expertise
on the other hand if there is usually insufficient notice of need it may be necessary to keep staff who have period with little to do between project
it is also desirable to have the possibility of shifting staff between design and operational duty
this not only provides flexibility in the use of it also improves communication
these real difficulty of utilisation are such a to force many organisation to become larger and larger if they are to remain economic
size provides a cushion to the vicissitude of market but it creates other problem
for example difficulty of communication and in particular how to inculcate the feeling within each individual that he and his performance are important to the organisation
this is considered in more detail in chapter
human resource should be fundamental to subject such a ergonomics which are essentially but the concept remains procedurally undeveloped at any level from a continent through country region and company down to particular working system
this is one reason why policy maker never seem to take account fully of the people affected by their decision
the design of procedure
the increased importance of standardised informational support for both machine and operator ha led to the concept of procedure a a separate design issue within a system fig
much of this information can be incorporated in computer program but there is also a need for extensive printed paper for the use of the operator
this take three main form checklist routine and
the terminology in this field is not standardised
software might be restricted a in this book to computer program but it is sometimes used a the generic term to include all source of information
procedure is sometimes used for what are here called routine and sometimes to indicate all the operator information support except software
the situation is further confused when some but not all the operator information support is itself
sometimes the term is used
however whatever the terminology used there is a requirement for design effort
the quality of procedure would be much improved if designer followed some simple table
many document are written on the implicit assumption that the reader is much like the writer in term of expertise and style of thinking
similarly it is assumed that the condition under which the reading will take place are the same a those of writing which are usually a clean office
they may have to be read in the open air in rain and darkness or within a plant under oily cramped poorly lit condition
the user probably ha limited expertise and he may be working under various stress condition
the material on which the information is printed the typeface used the sequence the structure and the format generally should reflect the condition of use easterby and zwaga
all these thing can be achieved if it is acknowledged that all procedure should a validated by user under the normal condition of use
checklist
checklist are used in the mode for routine maintenance and for
they normally take the form of a series of question or statement which the operator us to guide and structure his inspection of the hardware and other system component
the sequence is dictated by the optimal order in which action should be taken for example in starting up an aircraft
there are many situation when the order is of no great consequence for example a safety audit of a new machine and in this latter case some logical structure is needed
a mentioned above the logic of the design may not be the optimal basis if the way the operator think and act is different
baker suggests that four kind of shortcoming emerge when checklist are validated in the real situation
the operator may deviate from the listed procedure because it may require excessive moving about or because he is interrupted by the requirement of other task
systematic use of a checklist often reveals fault in work design such a inadequate access visibility and labelling
the checklist itself may be inconsistent incomplete imprecise or ambiguous
finally the checklist may have reprographic limitation such a inadequate vertical or horizontal structure poor typeface and insufficient linking of requirement description remark and point
the international ergonomics association developed a general ergonomics checklist which is reproduced in edholm
there is a deceptive simplicity about such list which requires extensive effort to ensure a comprehensive but coherent content
the context is of course the context of ergonomics a conceived by the designer of the list
routine
a routine is the most common form of instructional material
the reader is required to follow a series of step which might for example introduce a change in the performance of a complex system
normally routine are single chain of instruction although it is possible to have some conditional branching
each step should be simple and complete in itself preferably with some indication that successful completion ha been achieved for example the appearance or the change of colour of a signal light or the noise of a motor starting or a change of pressure which indicates that there ha been a change in the flow of some material
a mentioned earlier a routine can often be regarded a a written task description
by definition and design intention routine are inflexible
the user is intended to behave exactly according to their instruction
no great skill or intellectual effort is required which is one way of saying that the human operator is being but the purpose of a routine is usually to avoid common human error such a omitting a step or reversing step
in general the value of formal routine is precisely that the operator left to himself will not normally function in such a systematic sequential manner
knowledge text
knowledge is contained in document which may vary from single sheet presentation to large manual
a instructional material it is indirect in that the reader is not necessarily told what to do a in a routine
rather he is informed about the situation and the purpose of informing him is to provide a knowledge base from which he can work out his own action
nevertheless the relevant action remains important and the knowledge provided should be carefully and stringently selected
it is too easy to follow the academic tradition and provide knowledge for it own sake
the need to know criterion is crucial because unless it is applied the operator can be overburdened with unnecessary material
correspondingly the material should be structured in term of how it is most likely to be used
in this context the operator requires a guide for action and not a scientific
it is invariably better to provide material diagrammatically systematically or at least in short paragraph rather than in flowing prose
consider for example how readily information about the relative position of street is available from a map of a town centre rather than a verbal description of all the street
such a map will enable the reader to work out for himself how to get from one location to another within the town
note the enormous flexibility compared with a routine which would tell him only how to get from one particular point to another
a second important difference is that if he miss his place in a routine he will be totally lost whereas if he happens to go in the wrong direction while using a map he is still able to make whatever correction is necessary
however the map doe require more intellectual effort than doe the routine not only in making decision about how to proceed but also in filtering out the required information from the massive irrelevance for a particular task which is equally available
thus one would expect the use of the map to be slower than the use of routine with the human performance being more versatile but le predictable
with representation such a map it remains important to avoid too much homogeneity and provide substructure in the form of main road and key building or other feature such a river
see for example fig
manual which may contain map schematic diagram and other material warrant separate consideration
the design of manual
a manual is usually in the form of a book or booklet which is sent with the hardware from the maker to the customer
it is part of the communication package from the designer to the user
thus it is a particular form of job aid which provides the operator with information on a system and it performance
the standard of manual design ha traditionally been very low for several reason
for this purpose the designer is too familiar with the product and he rarely take the trouble to find out what the user really need to know
often the manual ha to be provided hurriedly at the end of a project when the budget is running out and it is regarded a a tiresome chore still required after the essential design work ha been completed
the problem is particularly acute for computer
manual for car machine tool and so on are poor but at least it is possible to observe the mechanism and their function
most computer operator do not know or wish to know about the mechanism and in any case these are not accessible to vision and manipulation
the computer operator is entirely dependent on the manual at least in the early stage of gaining familiarity with the system and it function
he is usually very badly served although the principle of manual design are well known
for most system the manual is best divided into part a indicated in table
the first part should be a general introduction which orientates the reader towards the system it purpose it functional structure and mode of operation and it performance limit
this should be followed by a separate section on how to set the system up in the first place and how to check that it is working properly
if it is fairly small it may be necessary to describe how to unpack it fix it into position connect it to power supply and start it up
if it is large the emphasis will be on the start up procedure
the section describing the operation of the system should cover not only how the system operates but also how the user can operate it
extensive use of line drawing schematic diagram algorithmic list is desirable and where prose is used this also should be structured into short sentence with meaningful separation into paragraph
the maintenance section should indicate what if anything the operator is expected to do and the symptom which indicate that more specialist maintenance skill are required
table subdivided into can be extremely helpful
part list including description reference number and sometimes drawing are necessary if the user is expected to deal with his own replacement
a standard fault is to assume that the reader is familiar with the jargon which the designer habitually us
a glossary of term and acronym used can be very helpful not only to the reader but also to the writer who is forced to consider carefully how he is using various technical term
finally all manual should end with an index which supplement the table of content at the beginning
attempting to integrate under five
policy in islington
margaret boushel clare debenham lisa dresner and anna gorbach
during the margaret boushel claire debenham lisa dresner and anna gorbach worked in the london borough of islington within social service for child
this chapter is an account of the way they perceived attempt to develop integrated provision for under five and the barrier in attitude and system which were encountered
the first section provides an overview of provision and service in
the next section describes attempt to create a clear policy
the third section look at the faltering progress towards integrated service
the fourth section examines the formidable barrier that were posed by reorganisation of social service local authority cut and the demise of the inner london education authority
the chapter concludes with a mixture of resignation and determination
background service in islington
islington is a inner city london borough with a child population of
in per cent of under five in islington had the use of an facility per cent on a and per cent on a basis
between and provision gradually increased so that by there were child day centre about playgroups and assisted place funded partially or totally by the social service department and and place in nursery school funded by the inner london education authority
the beacon nursery a local mencap project offered care five day per week to child over one year of age categorised a having severe learning difficulty
unlike council day centre playgroups or community nursery the beacon nursery wa free
child were collected from home by special bus and place were available on demand
the beacon had been in existence for many year and in the past had catered for up to thirty child with a wide range of disability and need
by it had half that number on roll
since number at the beacon continued to fall a it wa increasingly seen a a resource for child with severe and multiple disability
in addition the elfreda rathbone organisation a voluntary organisation helping people with learning disability ran a free day nursery in the borough for a small number of child with learning difficulty
some integrated service emerged in the early one playscheme wa developed through a parent initiative and an integrated adventure playground wa established by a voluntary organisation
worker from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported a local special school in integrating under five into a playgroup
in addition to it mainstream school the borough included five special school providing primary and secondary education to child with special need from islington and neighbouring borough one for child with moderate learning difficulty one for child with severe learning difficulty one for child with emotional and behavioural difficulty one for autistic child and one for child with physical disability
in three of these offered nursery place to child from the age of
the child using all of these service came from a wide range of ethnic background though rarely wa this actively and positively reflected in the type of care provided or the ethnic background of their carers
residential unit
by residential service were designed with care in the community in mind but most were based in specialist setting
for example field end house had been open for three year a a specialist unit for child with learning difficulty and wa designed to offer respite round the clock care
parent had fought for this a a local resource to prevent the need for child to be placed in placement far from home
by field end had been joined by another specialist child respite care unit at leigh road
the social service department also provided thirteen and residential unit for child in care by their number had been reduced to eleven none with wheelchair access and only one with any experience of caring for child with learning difficulty
the community health team
the community health team had major responsibility for assessing child and recommending provision
it included physiotherapist occupational and speech therapist doctor psychologist and a specialist health visitor
they were joined in the network by specialist teacher funded by the ilea and based in the special school who visited child at home before they were due to start school
this group of people met on a regular basis to coordinate service and discus professional issue
discussion of service to individual child also took place
this included deciding between day care or school and parent attitude to different option
often a member of the group wa delegated to advise parent on a course of action
the community health team aim wa to ensure a place of treatment for child from the earliest possible age to enable them to develop to their fullest potential
they were however an group operating without directly involving parent and were generally committed to specialist care in the community
they gave support to the beacon and elfreda rathbone nursery and most member saw these setting a the best place to treat child
because of their early contact with parent they often had considerable influence in steering parent towards specialist provision
the special service team
in the early social worker were funded jointly by the ilea and islington social service department to work with child attending two special school and two specialist unit for partially hearing child
these social worker were based in the borough special service team
they all worked with some under five attending the school they covered
they were aware of a number of child who did not have adequate access to resource or support when parent and professional were becoming aware of the possible extent and implication of the disability
when a vacancy arose within this group of social worker in it wa decided to appoint someone specialising in work with under five with special need
this might have had the effect of drawing family into the specialist system at an earlier stage
instead for a number of reason it proved to be a key step in the development of the debate about integration in islington
first the post wa not attached to any specialist institution
there wa an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely with the beacon nursery
second the worker had an alternative peer group of worker who were key figure in controlling access to all other facility
third the worker wa committed to the idea that treatment of a medical or disabling condition should not take precedence over the child social emotional and cultural need
there wa now a new worker in the network who also made an early relationship with family but who could present a broader choice of day care to parent
attempting an integration policy
the labour council elected in had a a stated policy aim that every child whose parent so wished wa entitled to a place of some sort
this led to the initiation of an review
the review team set up under the auspex of the social service committee included councillor senior departmental management and representative of the child day centre organiser and social worker in it membership
it proposed a network of centre throughout the borough an idea which the worker had been anxious to promote for some time
day care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the child day centre which would also provide information support and resource to parent
the review had made no mention of child with special need
the specialist social worker and another worker with a personal interest in the issue undertook a supplementary review to examine resource for these child
they interviewed parent specialist professional and mainstream worker and they designed a questionnaire which wa completed by worker in a large proportion of mainstream council service and voluntary organisation a well a by some
broadly the survey confirmed that parent of child with special need had not been given a real choice of placement and that they had to fight hard for mainstream provision if this wa their choice
parent wanted to be part of the and did not feel that they were
many commented on lack of information about the range of facility on offer
one woman described how she felt that she wa never given a choice of provision for her son and objected to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good
she fought hard to get him a playgroup place in the group his older brother attended
because the group had known her and her child for some time they agreed to have a go and the placement went ahead
she commented
i had to fight every step of the way for this
no one told me about it and no one wanted him to have it
i knew it wa right for him this is where he learnt to join in and be like other child
it doe matter that he not like them
i know what is right for my child but i not supposed to say
parent also wanted an increased availability of specialist therapy time but wanted it to be used in a more flexible way
some parent were very worried that more integrated setting would lead to lack of attention for child with special need
definition of special need varied widely in the questionnaire response some defining it a child with disability some including child with behavioural and emotional problem and some including child whose first language wa not english
this made the survey difficult to interpret
the finding were documented in a report a place for all our child ccuf and an analysis wa prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problem in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special need with suggestion for how these might be overcome
these idea were informed by a paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local mencap group who had previously tried to generate the debate within the community health service through the mencap committee
the conference a place for all our child
a a result of this work the coordinating committee for under five ccuf an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector group and individual providing a service to under five decided to organise a conference to look at the issue of integration of special need child within mainstream provision
prior to the conference various group met to produce short contribution to the debate
these included parent worker specialist worker child day centre organiser and playgroups organiser
each of these group came up with a list of proposal which were sent to everyone attending
about people attended the conference held in april
workshop facilitated by the speaker and the conference organising group examined integration policy overcoming practical problem for child in integrated provision and available source of information
the conference made the following recommendation

for a formal universal information system covering local and specialist resource

for child need to be considered with parent and their wish acknowledged and recognised

for employment of extra staff where needed and employment of peripatetic special need worker

for availability of money for equipment toy and adaptation

for enhanced payment to caring for child with special need

for priority status for child with special need in order to facilitate access to ordinary provision

for training facility for staff in ordinary provision specialist provision and

for greater communication and sharing of resource between ordinary and specialist provision

for therapeutic and professional staff to reflect the cultural background of the child and that for all child including those with special need their environment and activity to express a consciousness of the multicultural society in islington
it wa made clear that all of the above area needed funding from health education and social service before they could be implemented
finally it wa felt that unless the attitude of adviser and became more positive towards integration none of the recommendation could be effective
d warfare and crusade
the poet marbod of rennes celebrated in latin the vengeance which would befall a wicked castellan and his troop
the poem highlight two important development the use of force in punishing aristocratic crime the fruit of princely and the increasing significance of in warfare
intellectual claimed a formative influence in the second too john of marmoutier declared that monk from his own monastery had read vegetius de re militari to geoffrey le bel when he wa investing the castle of a rebellious castellan and ascribed his success to their advice on firebomb
but common sense may have been more important than learning in perceiving the vulnerability of most castle to and catapult for even in they were a a rule primitive structure
demanded on the one hand skilled operator and on the other a plentiful supply of unskilled labourer to move the necessary material
this effectively restricted their use to the wealthy and to those whose claim to assistance under the ban wa incontrovertible
equally the improvement in fortification needed to withstand their effect thick stone wall inner a well a outer defence required income greater than those of simple lord
the net effect wa that given dedication prince louis vi geoffrey le bel could subdue rebellious castellans within their own demesne and could build castle of their own which were impregnable to all but lengthy and sustained attack
henry ii castle at chinon where the treasury of anjou wa situated wa the model for it generation with it hall upper chamber tower and curtain walling set on a high point above a strategic crossing of the loire
it could be copied only either by those of nearly equal wealth or by those who could concentrate their resource chiefly on defence prince great bishop or in the south especially town
all others became vulnerable
john of salisbury comment that not only the town but also the fortress of gaul feared henry i of england wa revealing of the new situation
similarly campaigning in the field imposed an increasing financial burden
the treaty between robert ii of flanders and henry i of england renewed by their successor stipulated that each knight supplied to the english king should bring three horse with him this at a time when a horse represented a major investment
then knightly armour grew more elaborate and costly throughout the century
and though some knight might be supplied free by feudal service household one had to be maintained by their lord mercenary one needed pay and those with constituted a regular charge on the treasury
besides away from their home base knight were useless on their own
in open battle and in the plundering expedition that constituted the normal form of aggressive warfare they needed the backing of archer both mounted and on foot and of numerous infantryman
the usual source of supply wa town militia suger mention those of rheims laon soissons etampes and paris in the royal army of
but they might have to be supplemented by mercenary from flanders and the low country where the rapidly expanding population forced large number of young men into military career
in the eye of the faithful these brabanters with their freebooting and lack of discipline after the end of campaign were a dangerous a heretic in frederick barbarossa and louis vii agreed to expel them from their land
their value in battle a shield behind which the knight could shelter before they launched their charge ensured their continued employment by those who could afford them notably henry ii of england
but the hatred they aroused meant that they were liable to be brutally slaughtered if captured afterwards
inevitably therefore war on the grand scale a fought by prince bore little resemblance in practice to the feud of lesser men
the divergence wa sharpened by the application of a theoretical distinction the fruit of augustinian theology amplified a the century went on by canon and roman law reference prince pronounced their campaign just war fought against aggressor with the aim of peace or public war declared by a competent authority in the public interest while they condemned the war of lesser men a infraction of the peace
geoffrey martel had perceived the propaganda potential of public war a early a the mid eleventh century later it enabled henry the liberal of champagne to claim the military service of all lord within his county a reapplication of the carolingian ban
so it could be a powerful weapon
yet the logic of the definition suggested that it would benefit especially king whose competence to declare war could not be impugned thus thibaud of blois failed to persuade the monk of marmoutier that they owed him service when he fought against louis vi they claimed discretion in the matter and in the mighty philip of alsace hesitated to commit to battle the army he had summoned against philip augustus through fear that it rank might melt away
the contrast with the united front louis vi and his troop presented to the emperor henry v in wa marked
a royal banner now bestowed respectability on a cause king war were assumed to be for the sake of peace even when cripplingly expensive and increasingly savage
this go some way to explaining why the complicated campaign within toulouse in the second half of the century were largely fought out under the banner of the angevin aragonese and french king and why the revolt of henry ii son had widespread ramification
the twelfth century wa characterized therefore by fewer but more protracted war which smouldered for long period between short sharp bout of conflict like the war that covered must of the reign of henry i of england and louis vi of france the one inaugurated by the great rebellion of which outlived both louis vii and henry ii or that against catalan claim in the south
into these large number of local conflict were subsumed
the pattern caused problem in that the circumstance which might trigger off renewed fighting were unpredictable yet the moment an opportunity offered prince had to be prepared for invading their enemy there wa no time for lengthy preparation
the usual tactic wa to march troop across the enemy territory plundering and looting to take fortified place if the task wa easy to obtain ally among the lord of the locality and to retreat without fighting a battle if at all possible in effect an application to a wider canvas of the some technique of warfare which had earlier made castellans formidable in the immediate environs of their castle
it necessitated the rapid mobilization of auxiliary to join a core of troop kept constantly at the ready the prince military household which became the linch pin of the system
john of marmoutier life of geoffrey le bel offer a glimpse of how strong bond were created between the prince and his follower within the household and how a high level of training wa maintained at all time
geoffrey wa brought up from infancy with the son of neighbouring angevin lord on whose companionship he relied
when it came time for him to be knighted by henry i in rouen he set off for normandy with a crowd of these young men about him
in rouen the occasion wa celebrated with pomp elaborate dress and a great feast and then the youth all demonstrated their military skill at a grand tournament at which geoffrey naturally won the highest honour
it wa within this kind of environment that chivalry flourished that young men learned to identify their vassalage towards their lord a a symbol of their honour that they debated the relative merit of roland and oliver way of displaying loyalty and that they learned the finer point of jousting
tournament were disapproved of by ecclesiastic for they could be both bloody and dangerous
yet they supplied real need
that of an instruction in the martial art compatible with the maintenance of a prince peace that of an outlet for competitive instinct within the claustrophobic confines of a court and that of display to maintain princely social status
so they flourished everywhere
they offered opportunity for men of skill to acquire great position in the world arnoul of ardres caught the eye of countess ida of boulogne through his exploit and they also conferred lustre on the great geoffrey le bel and philip of alsace were throughout france for their distinguished performance in these show battle
all this formed a background to the first century of crusading and it go some way to explaining the more secular aspect of the magnetism which drew french knight to take up the cross in their thousand
urban ii launching the first crusade at clermont in presented it a a natural evolution of the peace movement warrior were to forget their petty feud and squabble in a campaign to promote the interest of holy church
the war declared by one whose moral authority wa unimpeachable wa to free the eastern church to end muslim guardianship of the holy place to restore jerusalem to it proper state
a prince saw it it wa a just war in the fullest sense of the term those who were slaughtered in it battle were regarded a among the martyr of the church
when raymond of toulouse robert ii of flanders robert curthose stephen of blois and hugh of vermandois responded to the call past and present member of their military household fell almost automatically into rank behind them to test themselves against terrible danger but also to enjoy the companionship in arm the adventure the deed of daring which were the stuff of the chansons de geste
that they shared along with all other participant in the crusade a fervent devotion a conviction that their sin would be forgiven is certain
yet for them crusading necessitated no large leap of the imagination no millenarian vision it wa simply a challenging and a deserving extension of their everyday activity
in french eye the hero of the first crusade wa robert ii of flanders
while raymond of toulouse remained in outremer stephen and hugh disgraced themselves in escaping from the siege of antioch and robert curthose no matter how gallant at least in his lifetime failed to impress robert ii prestige soared to the sky
he became robert of jerusalem to his contemporary his deed were recorded in the song of antioch his pious bravery totally expunged the memory of robert the frisian usurpation and after his death his son baldwin vii harped on his father achievement to justify his substantial use of coercion against the enemy of the church
outside flanders robert sister marriage to roger of sicily wa a mark of his new position in the world like louis vi sister marriage to bohemond of antioch it stretched french kinship connection into the new norman colony ensuring that traveller from the homeland would find a welcome in those distant part
robert example wa a potent one
after the next change in dynasty thierry and philip of alsace strengthened their shaky claim to the comital position by attaining for themselves the prestige attached to being the outstanding crusader of their generation
thierry remote connection with the family of godfrey de bouillon along with his marriage with sybilla of anjou fulk v daughter gave him some claim to the throne of jerusalem a a consequence the aristocracy of outremer viewed him and philip with mixed feeling expecting much of them yet fearing their ambition
in the end it wa not in outremer but in the newly conquered byzantine empire that the flemish crusading achievement wa crowned with the elevation of count baldwin ix to the imperial throne in
but in the twelfth century the house of alsace could afford the high cost of their expedition thierry went to jerusalem four time philip twice and the count repeated absence in fact promoted administrative reform the baillis and the grote bref were a much the product of crusading a the english and norman judicial system and exchequer were the product of the divided attention
but if on balance the flemish count benefited materially from crusading a arguably did the angevin they were far from typical
for other french house a commitment to outremer often represented a sacrifice of domestic political interest
the achievement of raymond iv st gilles in consolidating his authority within toulouse were threatened by his departure in especially since it wa known that he had no intention of returning home
then his example lured his elder son bertrand to tripoli in and his younger son alphonse jourdain there in
had not his grandson raymond v fulfilled his crusading obligation in his early youth thereby freeing himself from the necessity of interrupting his career in the county the principality of toulouse might have disintegrated altogether
william ix crusade of brought about serious financial problem in aquitaine which caused rapid devaluation in the hitherto stable currency and robert curthose decision to mortgage normandy to william rufus in order to cover his crusading expense exacerbated a conflict over the duchy which wa not settled until the death of his son william clito in
all in all it wa not surprising that suger mulling over the precedent of early crusading tried to dissuade louis vii from embarking on his jerusalem journey in
yet the appeal of crusading wa if anything even stronger to those aristocratic house just below the level of the princely it wa after all the house of boulogne which produced the first two ruler of jerusalem
the count of nevers the lord of montpellier the lord of amboise and lusignan the trencavels were fervent devotee of the ideal so the problem of absence shipwreck death abroad plagued them a much a their prince
on occasion their determination to sacrifice for christ played directly into their overlord hand a when the count of la marche who had no direct heir sold his county to king henry ii in
when it did not accompanying their prince in a joint crusading venture a the lord of amboise accompanied fulk v or hugh vi de lusignan william ix created new personal link
the political from crusading are therefore more difficult to calculate than at first glance they might appear
nevertheless it is clear that the chief gainer wa louis vii
the irony of this lay in the fact that the second crusade wa in outremer embittered relation with byzantium and resulted in the death of enormous number of it participant particularly those drawn from the class
yet it consolidated the king position within france partly through the skilled regency of suger but also because in taking on himself the leadership of the expedition louis a a credible ruler of men
his noble gesture appeased those churchman who had been appalled by his early obstinacy over the archbishopric of bourges
the disaster that befell his army paradoxically heightened his personal charisma even the baron of outremer continued to look on him a their one potential saviour
his friendship with raymond v of toulouse a fellow warrior reversed the trend of history since the middle of the tenth century in bringing the prince of the far south back into the king mouvance
the crowd of burgundians who accompanied the king learned to respect him on their return they sought the arbitration of the royal court in their dispute and they welcomed louis intervention within the county that fringed the duchy of burgundy
a william of st denis put it
even a early a it wa apparent that the crusading movement had provided a new sense of aristocratic cohesion in the realm
the great joint expedition the combined leadership although not without friction had been justified by their outstanding achievement the conquest and maintenance of jerusalem
they were the gesta francorum the deed of the frank or the gesta dei per franco god deed performed through the frank a two of their earliest chronicler entitled them
but what wa missing before wa a clear sense of who the frank were
the second crusade however wa launched with st bernard ringing appeal to the count and baron of brittany
in taking his place at the head of the second crusade the rex francorum decisively hastened the transformation of the frank into the french
revival under law
few contemporary would have expected balfour retirement to lead to a unionist recovery
the party wa in a mutinous condition in november and there wa no apparent successor who would have even half of balfour political gift
nor wa it clear that balfour departure wa universally desired at the national union conference a few day later leo maxse wa booed off the platform and constituency party everywhere passed resolution regretting balfour decision
a great many crocodile tear were shed for since unionist had such an elevated view of the principle of leadership they were unable to accept that they had just driven their own leader from office
the shock caused by balfour going thus did something to steady the party and it certainly produced a real determination to settle the affair of the party with le friction than had been fashionable of late
the main contender for the leadership were austen chamberlain and walter long representing the two different establishment of the edwardian unionist party the opposite world of birmingham and wiltshire but the situation wa complicated by the intervention of two outsider edward carson and andrew bonar law
two strong group emerged behind long and chamberlain about equal in number but there were few backer for carson or law
carson thereupon fell out of the contest or rather announced that he wa not standing for no official nomination had been made
the party officer and whip were solidly behind chamberlain but law drew off some of his support among tariff reformer and urged on by edward goulding and max aitken he refused to withdraw unless his continued candidature would allow long to win
against chamberlain it wa remembered that he wa a liberal unionist a wa lansdowne who led the unionist in the lord and that he had not been entirely loyal to balfour since the referendum pledge
long wa supported by the bulk of the english county member but by few of the party men of talent
by the morning of friday november it wa clear that neither chamberlain nor long would secure a majority and that some supporter of each of them would not contentedly follow the other
a party meeting wa to be held on the following monday and the whip were making preparation for a vote to be taken
chamberlain provided the way out by suggesting to balcarres that both he and long should withdraw and so allow law to be elected unanimously he also turned down balcarres remarkable advice that he should allow long to be elected since long would make such a mess of thing that chamberlain would be bound to succeed within the year
faced with chamberlain proposition and without a majority of his own long had no option but to agree
bonar law backed by fewer mp than any of the other three contender at the beginning of the week wa now to be the unanimous choice
robert sander reported the election meeting on november with evident satisfaction
the carlton meeting on monday went off quite admirably
harry chaplin in the chair a very great success
a good many men came into the room by no mean inclined to acquiesce in the proposed arrangement
walter long proposed bonar law
his speech wa one of the best thing i have heard
manly and rather touching
the country gentleman at his best
he spoke and evidently felt strongly of the degradation that it would have been to the parry to have elected a leader by secret ballot
austen followed
when austen sat down chaplin suggested that he had better put the question at once and on getting an affirmative shout did so
a clever way of stifling discussion and few could have done it so well
motion carried unanimously
bonar law then sent for
his speech struck me a the feeblest of the day
he wa evidently moved and nervous
the meeting separated in great content with the conservative party all round
it wa certainly creditable
the urgency of the event following balfour resignation wa due to the need to find a new leader before the national union conference
so within a few day of his grudging acceptance by his parliamentary colleague law leadership wa ratified by the throng of party notable at leeds here he received a reception more typical of what wa to come in the future
in law wa known in so far a he wa known at all in the parliamentary party a a spirited debater
a
taylor ha noted that law wa trained if he wa trained for anything in his early career to be a debater
in glasgow he had picked up many of the skill that a more politician might have acquired in the oxford union or at the bar but skill that were very different in appearance
his concern wa solely with effectiveness rather than style he rarely spoke with more than brief note and left it to the occasion to furnish the word
when he became chancellor of the exchequer this practice caused consternation at the treasury when he used only a page of note to assist him in moving complicated resolution on wartime finance he relied successfully on his memory to provide detail and figure
a an extempore speaker he wa able to tailor his word to his audience reaction and so convey the impression of personal conversation even when addressing thousand
in parliament he wa wont to abandon an argument if he sensed that his point had been made the speech that appear in hansard were touched up by his staff and his speech in the country were given to the press in advance
in debate he wa a formidable opponent and one that asquith wa never able to master for all his forensic skill
again law succeeded by unorthodoxy he wa quick to grasp the essential of an opponent argument and quite prepared to be rude or direct if the situation demanded it
in the long debate over marconi in and over the curragh mutiny in law wa able to nail asquith evasion where a more polished stylist might have been foiled
occasionally in the onrush of pursuit he gave commitment that were later regretted but these were a small price to pay
the unionist recovery wa built around law leadership but what asquith called the new style of obstruction threat and offensive behaviour did not originate with law
the beginning are to be found in the diehard campaign against the parliament bill
it wa in june that the first scene of disorder were mounted in the house of common led by lord hugh cecil
in august the diehard peer used language a violent a any that law wa to use later and in the crucial decision on the house of lord law sided with the hedger rather than the ditchers
ulster opposition to home rule long law leadership and he had rarely even spoken on irish affair in parliament before becoming leader
before he succeeded balfour then law wa not associated with any of the feature that were to characterize his party leadership his contribution wa to use the leadership in the service of all of these cause to make himself the spokesman for the most spirited section of the party
law conceived of the role of the leader in an exactly opposite sense from balfour he sought to foster unity by placing himself at the head of the discordant element where balfour had thrown the leadership on the side of restraint
their respective position explain this in part a minister and a considerable figure in his own right balfour had the confidence to believe in his own judgement even when isolated from the bulk of the party a the tertium quid in the recent contest law had neither the weight nor the confidence to take such a detached view
his strategy wa rather to canalize the enthusiasm of the diehard into party channel to articulate their view and to create unity from the sense of movement
in his characteristic phrase i am their leader i must follow them but he determined to follow them from the front
a a result of this he wa labelled a a diehard and a bigot when he actually distrusted the diehard and wa himself distrusted by the bigot
much of his leadership wa thus a form of pragmatic extremism extreme action and the threat of more extreme action to come but used in the cause of more limited objective
he certainly held deep conviction a to the absolute wrongness of the liberal policy that he opposed but at least a part of his apparent hostility wa assumed for the occasion a hard line that might secure a better compromise in the end
so in his first major speech a leader in parliament he wasted little time on the customary compliment and warned the government that he intended to play hard
in private conversation he told asquith i am afraid that i shall have to show myself very vicious mr asquith this session
i hope you will understand
in later conversation about ulster law wa frank enough to point out that bloodshed in ulster would be the best way of ensuring an electoral landslide for the unionist
there wa then an open toughness about party tactic before the buckingham palace conference in he had central office work out the electoral effect of excluding nine six or four county of ulster from an independent ireland the concern of a calculating pragmatist not of a bigot
from the party viewpoint law method were successful but dangerous expectation raised when the party wa in full cry were not easily set aside for an eventual compromise and the only outcome that would fully vindicate the method wa the recovery of power
the basis of recovery wa then law fighting capacity a leader
in parliament there would be a carefully organized campaign of resistance that would at least slow the government down and raise unionist morale
improved morale would also make possible organizational advance outside parliament all linked to the issue of ulster and with the sight fixed firmly on the next election an election that would make or break the union the empire and law leadership of the party
all wa linked to the sense of a new departure a new style a new regime in politics and a new team at the helm a well a a new leader the party had by the middle of a new chief whip party chairman party treasurer principal agent press adviser and an almost entirely new team of whip and organizer
party organization provided the easiest advance because it wa the only area entirely under the party control
no general election wa fought by the organization set up after but there is little doubt that there wa a massive improvement criticism that were commonplace in were not to be heard by
the space available to central office wa increased by the acquisition of st stephen house a well a st stephen chamber which had been occupied since the new office cost a year in rent alone
the quality of the senior staff wa improved by the appointment of three specialist
john boraston took over a principal agent in having been a professional organizer all his career and latterly chief agent to the liberal unionist council
he joined william jenkins appointed chief organizing agent in and previously district agent for the midland liberal unionist
the party wa indeed handed over to birmingham
finally malcolm fraser of the standard and of the daily express became first honorary press adviser and subsequently wa employed to run the press bureau at the colossal salary of
boraston jenkins and fraser made up a team of expert all of sufficient status to deal with politician who might call into the office the work of the office wa departmentalized for the first time and the head of department brought together into a supervising board
the influence of central office toned up the rest of the organization
a new canvas system wa introduced in so that all county constituency would operate the same system and so that duplicate record could be kept at area level
this wa important at a time when outvoters were a larger group in many constituency than the size of the majority and when the outvoters were overwhelmingly unionist
in a register of car owner wa compiled also important when some voter could cast several vote in an election when polling went several day
by november only constituency in great britain were without candidate a much better position than the position at dissolution in either or few of these constituency were winnable but in any case most of them had candidate by the end of
a programme of speaker for a general election wa also ready by with both constituency and politician told in advance what they might expect
the financial mismanagement that had reigned before wa ended with the employment of professional accountant
expenditure on central office district office and the london office doubled from in to in the total expenditure of the party organization from central fund also doubled from to over
to pay for this outpouring a great drive wa mounted for additional income farquhar and
in ordinary subscription still brought in only a year and it proved difficult to raise them to anything like what wa needed
the method adopted wa to canvas for capital donation that could then be invested to bring in a regular income and both balfour and law were used to raise the wind
told balfour that farquhar and i are endeavouring to raise more money
i think we are likely to succeed thanks in part to the very generous example set by lord rothschild
but i would b e very glad if i might see you on your return to ask you to help me in two case
systematic collection were made from peer and from the city by the outbreak of war the invested fund amounted to twice the sum in and worth four year expenditure and there wa a special cash deposit of for the coming election
in three other area a much political a organizational advance were made towards the management of the press the coordination of the heterogeneous collection that made up the party and the fostering of modern attitude in the local party
under malcolm fraser the party began to make effective use of it support in fleet street
it had been recognized that liberal had been more adept at handling the press because they were more ready to stoop to newspaper practice a sandars had reported in
i told northcliffe that if his people would make enquiry at our central office he would find that our nightly regiment of speaker wa at least a well worth reporting a the radical contingent but that i realized that from the press point of view no doubt our speaker did not play up to the reporter by handing them their speech in advance and by other trick of the kind to which the radical orator have recourse
this wa the essence of the problem the press could only be managed by someone who knew their method and who would not expect them to come round to central office to search for news
the uoc found that it is patent that some feeling exists among the unionist press that while in the past they have done much for the party the party ha not assisted in their work
in many quarter it is asserted that the unionist press are treated with greater courtesy by the radical than by their own side
fraser dealt with this problem without difficulty and explained to law in that the importance of getting important speech in advance is shown in concrete manner by your wallsend speech on october
the verbatim report reached most of the newspaper in place such a aberdeen at one o clock in the morning of the
he went on to quote the response that had been received from editor
manchester dispatch i hope you will continue this form of enterprise
you fully know a an old pressman the difficulty of dealing with a big speech late at night
daily express i am much obliged to you for the precis of mr bonar law speech last night
it wa a great help to u
the speech came over the wire so late and the sheet were so confused by the post office which is usual in these case that without the precis we could not possibly have got the leader through in time for the first edition
so in the supply of information to newspaper predisposed to support the party much wa achieved merely by employing a specialist
the other side of press management depending on informal contact is le easy to ass
in invited blumenfeld of the daily express to central office for a exchange of idea and advice
he also used law himself to impress editor who were on le familiar term with fraser a with marlowe of the daily mail and law took a direct interest in negotiation with the most difficult of all the unionist editor garvin of the observer
law personally conducted the negotiation with gardner sinclair over the sale of the observer and the pall mall gazette in this negotiation also demonstrates that a well a producing information and nursing editor the party had to work hard to keep some of the newspaper in business
sinclair did buy the observer and the pall mall in the end but not before he had been given a guarantee from party fund
such investment had a double purpose for they could bring in income and provide a political bonus
one such scheme involved the purchase of the daily express by max aitken with party fund but the party wa also propping up the globe the standard and a wide range of provincial daily
all these transaction were secret for there would be little use in keeping a paper alive if it were known to be owned by a political party
the paper were therefore bought through nominee or bank loan backed with party capital
it wa usual to extract some form of guarantee in exchange for party support but the secrecy prevented such undertaking from being enforced
sinclair thus gave an undertaking that his paper would always remain unionist but doubted if such a promise had any value
the later history of the daily express suggests not when the express became hostile in the younger raged when i think of the large sum of money this office ha put into that gutter print it make my blood boil
the justification for pouring out large sum without a certain return wa the even greater cost of any real alternative
the support for the express in provides for the introduction of or to retain the only paper the party posse in london and no le a sum than to would be necessary to start a similar paper if the daily express were allowed to go
the struggle therefore went on to keep the unionist press alive and in and both aitken and northcliffe stood by the party and gave valuable support in their paper
the coordination of competing party body wa carried out with surprising ease
the national union wa merged with central office in and fusion with the liberal unionist followed in
joseph chamberlain retained his preference for independence but allowed himself to be overruled by austen and by the overwhelming wish of the liberal unionist council to merge
to cater for all susceptibility the party became the national unionist association of conservative and unionist association a decision that allowed some local party to go on calling themselves conservative but the name liberal wa at last dropped
the liberal unionist were admitted to the carlton club and a longstanding source of tension wa eradicated
this wa in itself a striking commentary on what had already been done liberal unionist who had resisted amalgamation under balfour and in acquiesced meekly under law and in
other organization could not be absorbed but could still be brought within the central office orbit
so in offered to join the halsbury club in order to guide it on to safer line and wa immediately accused of disloyalty by walter long
long helped though by placing both and boraston on the executive committee of the union defence league for the same purpose
also explained to lord robert cecil that it ha been arranged that the national conservative union should send out leaflet produced by several of the ancillary organization such a the tariff reform league the union the primrose league the london municipal society etc
the central office attitude wa flexible for outside body would always exist and could even be made use of
they represent a time when either their object were not the same a those of the official organization or the cco wa not enterprising enough to suit them
but some caution should be observed
it may be wise while retaining or regaining control to trade under different name
in some case additional subscription may be obtained in others full responsibility may be avoided
with open ally like the primrose league the case for collaboration wa strong for the first time in thirty year of existence the primrose league formally linked itself with the party in
on the other hand the independence of the tariff reform league wa a positive advantage after january the party supported the tariff policy but wa not including them in it immediate programme so that central office could continue to distribute tariff propaganda from the trl without compromising party policy
in general effort to ensure better coordination were a matter of the patient building up of contact although the improved party morale and the greater efficiency of central office had removed their justification for existence

steady current

the basic equation
in this chapter we shall be concerned with phenomenon in which the main role is played by the current of charged particle
all our variable can be function of space but are independent of time
it is easy to present the relevant equation we have all of eqns but have to substitute o yielding formula
there is a difficulty with eqn
it is correct for most of the chapter with formula taken a a constant but break down for ferromagnetic material which will be discussed in section
all the other equation are all right but will not necessarily provide the simplest starting point for solving a given problem
we shall therefore introduce a number of alternative formulation
first we could search for some analogue of the potential function which proved so useful in electrostatics
we found there that by choosing a scalar function in the form formula we could automatically satisfy the other equation for the electric field strength formula
can we do the same thing for the magnetic quantity
no but we can do a similar thing
since it is the equation formula that need to be satisfied we should choose the potential a a vector called not without logic the vector potential defined by the equation formula
substituting the above equation into eqn we get formula or using the vector relation eqn we obtain the modified form formula
this equation can be further simplified to formula by choosing in the physicist jargon this is called choosing the gauge formula
can we do that
one ca usually assign some arbitrary value to the divergence of a vector function
in the present case however we do have some freedom of choice
the definition of a by eqn is not unique
if we add to a the gradient of a scalar function the resulting vector a still give the same magnetic field because formula
hence a suitable choice of will ensure that formula
so we are left with eqn
if the current density is specified eqn will provide the solution for a from which b can be determined
how can we find a solution for a
there is nothing easier
we only need to remember the differential equation for the scalar potential formula eqn and it solution in the form of eqn
by analogy the general solution of eqn is formula
a simple integration will yield a if j is given
we shall go through a number of example later
for the moment let u use the above expression for deriving law
first we shall assume that the current density is confined to a thin wire in which case the integration variable may be changed to formula where s is a vector normal to the formula is the area of the and di is an elementary vector along the tangent of the wire
noting further that i and that i must be constant along the wire we may write eqn in the modified form formula whence the magnetic field strength is formula
we have to stop here for a moment to sort out the coordinate
a may be seen in fig the coordinate of the wire element are x y z whereas the coordinate of the point where we wish to determine the magnetic field are set of coordinate
thus the curl operates on the coordinate of p but not on those of dl leading to formula where ir is the unit vector in the direction r and we have made use of the vector relation in the appendix
this is law derived directly from maxwell equation
are there any other way of determining the magnetic field
well one can use eqn a it is but very often one is better off by using it integral form that can be obtained by integrating both side of eqn over a surface formula
by using stokes theorem for the and recognizing that the integral of the current density give the current the above equation reduces to formula where the line integration is along the curve c enclosing the surface
the positive sense of the integration path is defined relative to the positive current direction according to the usual convention
equation is known a law
we have now a number of equation describing the same thing
which equation should we use in a practical case the equation for the vector potential law law or attack directly maxwell equation
it hard to tell
experience with practical calculation help but even after year of work one usually remains this side of infallibility
i regret to say that there are no general guideline available
if one manages to find the simplest method at the first attempt that can mostly be attributed to good luck
can we claim then that the vector potential is a useful a it scalar counterpart in electrostatics
for computational purpose the answer is an unambiguous no
it is always laborious to find the component of a vector so we are not much better off with a than with h or b it turn out however that a is a more basic quantity of physic than b since b is given by the curl of a it is possible that a is finite while it curl is zero
interestingly under these condition a ha an effect on certain phenomenon
it would be unfair both to the vector potential and to quantum mechanic to say that none of those formulation have engineering application in fact the most sensitive magnetometer built to date is based on that kind of theory but by and large engineer would lose much sleep if the use of a were banned with immediate effect
the vector potential is not a popular variable among engineer maybe because it is not directly measurable
there are no instrument capable to measure the magnitude or direction of a
in my opinion a is a useful thing if used with moderation
it helped u to derive law it will come handy later in solving certain radiation problem and it often lead to nice formula for the magnetic flux crossing a surface defined a formula that may be rewritten in term of the vector potential a follows formula where c is the curve enclosing the surface
we have now collected a good number of formula which will serve u well in the following section
before going on just a few word about the classification of steady current
it may be roughly divided into two part magnetostatics and the rest
we shall discus the rest first section and that will give u some idea of the relative significance of electric and magnetic field
section are concerned with magnetostatics where electric field are assumed to be zero and the interrelationship of j h and b are studied
since we have so many variable and since in each physical configuration only some of them appear we will record just for this chapter the variable in each section heading

the defocusing of an electron beam j e d p h b
we have so far talked about positive and negative charge about point charge and distributed charge
i shall now introduce the concept of an elementary charge c carried by an elementary particle called the electron
this is not a necessity
it is possible to study electromagnetic theory without ever mentioning the word electron but since it ha become such a household word and is used so often we can just a well make use of it
in the present section we shall consider a cylindrical electron beam of radius a in which the charge density is uniform p po and all electron travel with velocity v
we are not going to enquire into the detail how such beam can be produced it belongs to the subject of physical electronics we shall accept the fact that the beam exists and will try to work out the force on the outermost electron
there is now cylindrical symmetry and a net charge per unit length formula yielding for the radial component of the electric field formula
the magnetic field may be obtained from law eqn a follows formula where the line integral is taken over the circle of radius a fig i is the total current of the beam and formula is the azimuthal component of the magnetic field in the cylindrical coordinate system specified by formula
from eqn we get formula
the electric force on an electron of charge e travelling at the edge of the beam r a is it is in the radial direction pointing outwards
the magnetic force is perpendicular both to the direction of motion axis and the direction of magnetic field formula direction
the vectorial product v x b give an inward force in the radial direction
hence the net force on the electron is formula
noting that formula and anticipating the relationship formula to be derived in section we get the following formula for the force formula where c is the velocity of light
it may be seen from the above equation that the magnetic force is negligible in comparison with the electric force unless the velocity of the electron approach the velocity of light
thus the conclusion is that owing to the repulsive force between the electron a cylindrical electron beam is unstable
using a technical term borrowed from electron optic we could say that the electron beam get defocused
the other conclusion a far a it is permissible to generalize from a single example is more important in principle
it is concerned with the relative magnitude of electric and magnetic force
since charged particle rarely travel close to the velocity of light we may conclude that the magnetic force are by order of magnitude smaller than the electric force
why is it then that we have no difficulty in practice in observing magnetic field
the reason is of course that there are two kind of electric charge and their effect usually cancel so the small magnetic field ha a chance of getting observed
and that brings u to the ext example
pinch effect j h b
in contrast to our previous example we shall now investigate a cylindrical beam consisting of two kind of charge carrier negative electron and some positive particle which i do not wish to be more precise about at the moment
we shall assume that the two kind of particle have equal density and move in opposite direction
a a result there is no net space charge and hence no electric field
the current on the other hand do not cancel because they represent opposite charge moving in opposite direction remember minus one time minus one is equal to plus one
the magnetic field strength is given again by eqn we only need to substitute for the current in ip where the subscript n and p refer to negative and positive particle respectively
hence the magnetic force on the electron at the edge of the beam at r a is formula and on the positive particle is formula
note that the force is inwards and in the same direction for both particle
let u distinguish two case
both particle are mobile
in that case both of them will move inwards under the effect of magnetic force
but if the diameter of the beam is reduced eqns and tell u that the force are even larger
what happens then
if everything wa uniform then the beam diameter would go on decreasing
in practice however the beam is not uniform and doe not posse perfect cylindrical symmetry
under these condition the motion of the particle is fairly complicated and of course our model is unable to predict the detailed behaviour of the particle
nevertheless a few qualitative conclusion may be drawn without doing any further mathematics
if the happens to be smaller at a certain place then the force are larger there than at the neighbouring so the beam will be further constricted etc leading to the sausage instability fig a
if the magnetic field happens to be larger at one side than at the other side then the beam will be deflected towards the weaker field which make the field even weaker etc leading to the kink instability fig b
the positive particle is immobile
in practice this mean that the positive ion are part of the crystal lattice
there is then no magnetic force on the ion only on the electron
so the electron want to move inwards but can not because the ion hold them back by virtue of their electrostatic attraction
naturally if the ion attract the electron the converse is true a well owing to the magnetic force on the electron there is also an inward force upon the ion
so the whole crystal structure try to contract or in other word the material is under pressure see example
in any practical situation this pressure is small and can be neglected when calculating the force on conductor

flow pattern and ohm law j e d
up to now we have not enquired into the question of how the current arose
we just assumed that certain charge carrier moved with certain velocity
now we shall say that in a class of material the current density at any point is proportional to the electric field in mathematical form formula where formula is the conductivity of the material
the above equation is spite of it utmost simplicity represents an extremely good guess
it is valid for nearly all material up to quite high electric field
will there be a magnetic field
yes of course whenever there is a current there is a magnetic field a well
but the effect of the magnetic field upon the motion of the electron is nearly always negligible one exception causing the pinch effect is mentioned in the previous section
thus we may safely ignore the magnetic field when determining the line of current flow
we are then left with only one equation formula or formula or formula depending on our preference
eqn tell u that there is some analogy see example with the electrostatic case treated in chapter
we may in fact reinterpret any of the diagram of fig by assuming that the whole space is filled with a material of conductivity formula and the field line are now the line of current flow a well
is the analogy perfect
not really because a current flow there is some potential drop in the electrode itself zero conductivity for part of the space can not be electrostatically modelled since there are no dielectric with er and when current flow through two material of different conductivity there is generally a surface charge at the boundary see example
it is not worth discussing any of these complication because one is rarely called upon to work out line of current in a conductor
we shall rather return to a very simple geometrical configuration for deriving ohm law
we shall take a piece of cylindrical material of length l and s and apply a voltage between the end
the electric field is then formula the current density formula and the current formula
from circuit theory formula where r is the resistance of the material
comparing eqns and we get formula
since formula is by definition the resistivity we get the result you learned in school that the electrical resistance is proportional to the resistivity and the length of the sample and inversely proportional to it
a more general definition of resistance valid for varying may be easily arrived at but it is hardly worth the trouble
the essential thing is that the relation formula is equivalent to ohm law
risking the dismay of circuit engineer some theoretician do in fact refer to eqn a ohm law
prologue
royal academy of art london
he signed the friend book in his elegant handwriting alexander wedderburn january
she had said peremptory a always that he wa to go straight to room iii where the miraculous stuff wa to be found
early
so here he wa a distinguished public man also an artist of a kind stepping obediently through room i french and room ii british and on a lead grey morning to the pale grey classical quiet place where the bright light shone and sang off pigment so that the phrase miraculous stuff seemed merely accurate
on one long wall hung a row of van gogh including an arles poet garden he had seen before but recognised from small photograph from charged description in the painter letter
he sat down and saw a bifurcated path simmering with gold heat round and under the rising spreading vane of a great pine still widening where the frame interrupted it soaring
two decorous figure advanced under it suspended thickness
and beyond green grass and geranium like splash of blood
alexander wa not worried about whether frederica would turn up
she wa no longer in the habit of being late her life had schooled her to temporal accuracy perhaps to being considerate
he himself at felt not quite accurately that he wa now too old too settled to be put out by her or by anyone else
he thought with warmth of her certain approach
there had been a pattern an only too discernible repetition in the event and relationship of his life into which she had ruggedly refused to fit
she had been a nuisance a threat a torment and wa now a friend
she had suggested that they look at van gogh together setting up another form of repetition deliberate contrived and aesthetic
his play the yellow chair had first been presented in he did not like to think too closely about it a he did not like to think too closely about any of his past work
he stared at the serenely impassioned garden made out of a whirl of yellow brushstrokes a viridian impasto a dense mass of furiously feathered line of isolated black pot hook the painfully clear spattering
he had trouble finding an appropriate language for the painter obsession with the illuminated material world
he would have been lying if he had recorded only the more accessible drama of the painter electric quarrel with gauguin in the yellow house in arles the distant necessary brother who supplied paint and love the severed ear delivered to the whore in the brothel the asylum fear
at first he had thought that he could write a plain exact verse with no figurative language in which a yellow chair wa the thing itself a yellow chair a a round gold apple wa an apple or a sunflower a sunflower
sometimes he still saw the brushstrokes a it were in this naked way so that his earlier thought of this garden had to be undone the idea of black wing to be stripped from the painted leafage the vulgar idea of blood splash washed off the notation of geranium
but it could be done
language wa against him for a start
metaphor lay coiled in the name sunflower which not only turned towards but resembled the sun the source of light
van gogh idea of thing had also been against him
the yellow chair besides being brushstrokes and pigment besides being a yellow chair wa one of twelve bought for a company of artist who were to inhabit the yellow house the white wall of which should blaze with sunflower a the window of gothic cathedral blazed with coloured light
not only metaphor cultural motif immanent religion a faith and a church
one thing always linked to another thing
a the poet garden a decoration for the bedroom of the poet gauguin wa more than it seemed
some time ago i read an article on dante petrarch boccaccio and botticelli
good lord it did make an impression on me reading the letter of those men
arles
and petrarch lived quite near here in avignon and i am seeing the same cypress and oleander
there is still a great deal of greece all through the tartarin and daumier part of this queer country where the good folk have the accent you know there is a venus of arles just a there is a venus of lesbos and one still feel the youth of it in spite of all
but is it true this garden ha a fantastic character which make you quite able to imagine the poet of the renaissance strolling among these bush and over the flowery grass
the youth of it alexander thought
i thought i wa then
in july two year after writing this van gogh had shot himself inefficiently in the groin and had died slowly
in alexander a man had read the centenary edition of the letter
he had himself been rising and when the yellow chair wa put on had passed that age wa older now than van gogh a he had in the realised that he wa older than keats
he had felt perhaps briefly the power of the survivor
what nonsense
the eternal youth of provence
he thought of thick fat hot motorway carving up that land
he turned his attention to the timeless field of wheat and olive
she made a kind of progress up the palladian marble stair
a painter stopped to kiss her a journalist waved
john house who had organised the exhibition came almost leaping down the stair accompanied by a smallish woman in a coat
he also kissed frederica and introduced the woman fumbling her name a a colleague and frederica a frederica you must forgive me i never know what name you re working under woman these day are so protean
frederica did not attempt to ascertain the fumbled name having given up interest in stray new people until it wa clear that they were of real concern
she assumed wrongly that john house colleague wa an art historian
the colleague looked at frederica with an apparently scanning attention
john house spoke of the history of the gathering of the image an emptiness here jacob wrestling the angel an unexpected illumination there
frederica listened attentively went on and signed the visitor book
frederica potter radio critic forum
she negotiated a free catalogue
she made her leisurely way towards where she had told alexander to be
an old woman armed with a sound guide became quite excited and pulled at the arm of another
hey look at that winston churchill painted that the carefully cap
frederica dipped round her to stare claude monet au cap par vent de mistral
a whirl of blue and rose for in le formed plungings of water and wind
to paint she remembered from proust description of fictive elstir that one doe not see what one see
to paint light and air between ourselves and object
i said dear winston churchill the second woman tugged free of the clutching finger
not to be mentioned in the same breath with she said looking nervously from frederica to painted signature
the arrested water shone and danced
in the catalogue john house quoted monet description of the painted light around the snowy haystack a an enveloping veil
he also quoted i think that there should be only allusion
to name an object is to suppress of the enjoyment of the poem which is created by the gradual pleasure of apprehending it
to suggest it that is the dream
it wa not a view of thing with which frederica wa entirely in sympathy she liked naming name
but she looked briefly down dazzled by the flowing skin of worked and delicate colour the blue and rose tourbillons of the mistral on the sea the prismatically sliced frosty nimbus round the mysterious squat stack
she scribbled word note in the margin of her catalogue
daniel bought a ticket and paid for the hire of a catalogue he wa sure why
he had come he believed because he needed to discus certain administrative problem with frederica
he wa aware that she believed he wa in need of art
under his arm he carried a folded newspaper with that day headline peace mother dy
he wa raw to bad news more raw a he grew older which wa not perhaps quite what he had expected
he saw and did not see the painting
there wa a field of poppy and corn which reminded him only of small and large faded and ghostly version of van gogh harvest which he had seen repeated in endless hospital corridor waiting room school office
he had seen these ample field a he had seen cezanne geometric brown and green undergrowth in more than one mental hospital day room
odd he thought considering that van gogh himself had died mad and despairing in such surroundings
not serene overexcited these field
daniel patience with the nervously ill wa not what it had been
although he wa fourteen year younger than alexander daniel too wa in the habit of thinking of himself a a survivor a battered and grizzled survivor
alexander saw her coming towards him
a dozen or so schoolgirl were dutifully filling in xeroxed questionnaire
alexander always a connoisseur of garment realised that frederica had changed her style that the clothes the young creature were wearing could be described a a parody of the clothes frederica had worn at their age and that frederica new style wa not unrelated to this shift
there she wa in a conventional suit fine dark wool muted geometrical pattern in green and unexpected straw brown caught in at the waist still very thin to give the effect of a bustle the skirt long and straight to the knee
she had ruffle not swashbuckling at the neck and the small velvet hat could but did not support a veil
the pale red hair wa in a figure of eight chignon in her neck reminiscent of one of cafe
fifty and thought alexander connecting
she came up and kissed him
he remarked on the
she took the point eagerly
my dear i know
pencil skirt and batwing sweater and spiky stiletto tottering with their hard little behind sticking out and all that red lipstick
i remember when i thought lipstick had gone forever a dream of painted excess a i thought paper taffeta had gone forever in cambridge when we all took to glazed cotton
do you remember
of course
do you remember the eclectic sixty parody when we went to the national portrait gallery everything from swami to and too
these are such a serious and uniform parody
more and more of the same
more of me

and you
you have reverted to type
oh i in my element
i understand the fifty
i could do the forty bit at all padded shoulder and crãªpy thing ugh and pageboy i think it must have been purely oedipal those were my parent thing dammit what i wa getting away from
this is my scene
so it is
and now i have money
in our new austerity you have money
in our new austerity i am old enough to have money
they saw daniel advancing
daniel doe change said alexander
sometimes i wish he did said frederica
daniel did not change
he wore the same black clothes baggy corduroy heavy sweater jacket that he had worn through the sixty and seventy
like many hirsute men he had thinned a little on top where once his black fur had been extravagant but he had a plentiful and prickling black beard and his body wa still compact and very heavy
he looked in this setting a little like some painter
he saluted frederica and alexander with his rolled newspaper and said that it wa cold outside
frederica kissed him too reflecting that he wa dressed like a man who smelled dirty but in fact did
alexander smelled still of old spice and a sort of agreeable toastiness
his smooth brown hair wa a thick a ever but shot now with needle of glittering silver
we must talk said daniel
first you must look at the picture
take time off
i keep trying
i went to the king carol service
good for you
frederica glanced shrewdly at him
now look at the picture
gauguin man with the axe
one for you said frederica to alexander still skimming the necessary accompanying print
androgynous
john house say
no gauguin said
do you think
alexander considered the decorative gold body itself a repetition of a body on the parthenon frieze
he saw a blue loincloth flat breast purple sea with coral tracing lying flatly on it
he wa unmoved though the colour were rich and strange
he told frederica he preferred his androgyne to be more obscured more veiled more suggested and directed her attention to fete gloanec in which various inanimate object two ripe pear a dense bunch of flower swam across a bright red rimmed with a black ellipse
the picture wa signed madeleine bernard and alexander told frederica that gauguin had flirted seriously with that young woman had characterised her a wa fashionable at the time a having the desirable unattainable androgynous perfection complete sensuality combined with unattainable
frederica informed him from the catalogue that the vegetation wa supposed to be a jocular portrait by gauguin of madeleine the pear her breast the dense flower her hair
you could read it another way said alexander interested now you could read the pear a androgynous in themselves a partly male
and the hair a other hair said frederica loudly scandalising a few bystander amusing a few more
you like to cork for your image do you alexander
it age said alexander peaceably untruthfully
they were beginning to attract a penumbra of a though they were offering a guided tour
they moved on to the olive picker
daniel mind wa elsewhere
he remembered a straight mass of hair in cold king chapel more golden than foxy frederica slowly settling onto a collar a the pin released their grip
he saw a mass of freckle sometimes melding into brown patch of warmth moving over the hard frame of cheekbone and brow
the sexless voice rose in the cold
unto u a boy is born
herod then with wrath wa filled
the voice played with the slaughter of the innocent treble and descant hunting each other while she bowed her head unable to sing in tune
the olive had been painted from the asylum at st in
a for me i tell you a a friend i feel impotent when confronted with such nature for my northern brain were oppressed by a nightmare in those peaceful spot a i felt one ought to do better thing with the foliage
yet i did not want to leave thing alone entirely without making an effort but it is restricted to the expression of two thing the cypress the olive tree let others who are better and more powerful than i reveal their symbolic language
look here there is another question that come to mind
who are the human being that actually live among the olive the orange the lemon orchard
frederica and alexander held a discussion of natural supernaturalism
daniel looked at the pink sky the twisted trunk the silvery leaf the rhythmic earth streaked with yellow ochre with pink with pale blue with
olive frederica agreed with alexander could not recall the mount of olive the garden of gethsemane in the day of van gogh the pastor son the lay preacher
a the cypress must always differently mean death
daniel asked for politeness really why van gogh had been mad wa it just that he wa driven
alexander said that it may have been a form of epilepsy exacerbated by the disturbance of the mistral and the heat
or you could make a freudian explanation
he felt guilty towards the child who had not survived for whom he had been named
he had been born on march
his dead brother vincent van gogh had been born on march
he wa in flight from his family his dead alter ego his uncertain sense of identity
he wrote to theo i hope you are not a van gogh
essentially i am not a van gogh
i have always looked upon you a theo daniel said he could not see the pain frederica said wa in the olive and alexander still lecturing said that vincent had objected to painting of symbolic christ in gethsemane by bernard and his had torn up his own had made do with the olive themselves
he told daniel about the terrible st painting of the blasted tree about and daniel said that it wa odd that these orchard should be all over the wall of other asylum now to cheer people up
the tree stood under their halo of pink and green stroke small flying thing solidified light movement or saccade of the eye brushstrokes pigment
here is a description of a canvas which is in front of me at the moment
a view of the park of the asylum where i am staying on the right a grey terrace and a side wall of the house
some deflowered rose bush on the left a stretch of the park the soil scorched by the sun covered with fallen pine needle
this edge of the park is planted with large whose trunk and branch are the foliage green gloomed over by an admixture of black
these high tree stand out against an evening sky with violet stripe on a yellow ground which higher up turn into pink into green
a wall also shuts off the view and is topped only by a violet and hill
now the nearest tree is an enormous trunk struck by lightning and
but one side branch shoot up very high and let fall an avalanche of dark green pine needle
this sombre giant like a defeated proud man contrast when considered in the nature of a living creature with the pale smile of a last rose on the fading bush in front of him
to emile barnard st december
you will realise that this combination of of green gloomed over by grey the black streak surrounding the contour produce something of the sensation of anguish called from which certain of my companion in misfortune frequently suffer
i am telling you about this to remind you that one can try to give an impression of anguish without aiming straight at the historic garden of gethsemane
daniel thought about dead ann maguire who like anna van gogh the dutch pastor wife had named a younger hopeful child for a dead one
though in van gogh case the name theodorus vincent vincent theodorus appeared and reappeared from generation to generation the cultural parallel to certain persisting aspect of the family face a heavy brow an intense blue eye a cheek bone a nostril
in the churchyard in his last parish a family in the english had tried to name a son walter cornelius brittain and had buried three aged five aged two aged one month interspersed by variegated dead daughter a jennet a marian an eva
in august a car containing an ira gunman possibly already dead ploughed onto a pavement and killed three of mr maguire child joanne eight john two andrew six week leaving one son mark aged seven
people had been shocked by number a well a by gratuitous death itself a people will be and mr maguire sister and a friend had founded the peace people whose brave beginning and sad end will not be chronicled here
ann maguire had borne a second joanne in new zealand from where she had returned unable to bear cultural transplantation
although the paper referred to her a the peace mother she had not been active in the peace people
she had brought a case for legal compensation for her dead child life and for her own suffering and one of her few recorded public utterance wa to call the first offer of compensation pitiful
the day of the hearing of her second case she had been found dead
daniel had pieced the story together from the radio with throat wound
foul play wa not suspected and from conflicting newspaper
with
with a carving knife
with an electric by her side
her motif the coroner wa to say were not completely easy to understand
daniel who had become a specialist in wild blow of chance thought he understood some of it
he had not prayed for ann maguire
he wa not that kind of priest
he had metaphorically shaken a large fist impotently at some looming and got on with his work his work
he followed the other two into the dark shadow of the room housing the low country
nun ascended and descended a cool grey stair in winged white cap
the lauriergracht in amsterdam wa gloomed and glittering
mondriaan evening wa sombre and cloudy
he liked these
like vincent although he wa unaware that vincent had remarked on it he had northern brain and responded biologically and spiritually to tone of black varied grey touch of white in dark
one of the most beautiful thing done by the painter of this country ha been the painting of black which nevertheless ha light in it vincent had written from holland
xavier mellery the painter of the nun wa described in the catalogue a creating a light which is the negation of that which envelops our immediate visual experience of thing it is rather the interior light of your mind
daniel wa used to such language it wa his daily or anyway weekly pabulum
he knew about the light shining in darkness and had come for reason completely different from alexander desire for exactness specificity to mistrust figurative language
he never now made a sermon from a metaphor nor drew analogy he preached example case lesson
but he liked the black dutch painting they were so to speak on his wavelength
he cornered frederica
a postcard yes
where this time
kenya
on the way to the ugandan famine i think
hippie said daniel
helping out said frederica
what use comparatively is a chap like that wi no training no medical no
another mouth to feed
it make me wild
i think he is often useful in his way
you judge him so he judge me
judging run in the family
it doe said frederica
once said daniel i wa in charing cross hospital someone kid had taken an overdose and died they pump them out there regular a clockwork but this one liver could take any more
anyway there i wa going up this endless corridor thinking what to do about the mother who blamed herself wi reason mind you she wa one of those soft suckering but that made it worse not better and there wa th trolley wi the dead girl on it sliding by me sheet right over porter in those soft theatre boot and floppy plastic bathcaps and when they got past me and were turning i door the first one looked at me from under his plastic frill like with my own face
i wa shocked for a minute
got all his hair tucked up in that thing you see otherwise he not so like me not strikingly so
hi he said
going about your father business are you
so i asked him what he wa up to and he said he wa going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down in it and then he pushed th trolley in and i went in after and the mother began her howling and shrieking and will said well i walk off and leave you to it
and i said where are you going then
and he said i told you
to and fro
that wa the last i saw of will
the nun ascended the stair in a perpetual cool silence
quoting scripture for his own purpose said daniel
that wa rather funny i thought said frederica
anything on the postcard about coming back
any plan
no
sometimes she wished will would not write to her at all if he would send no message to daniel
sometimes she told herself the postcard or exercise book scrawl were message to daniel but one should never she considered ignore surface meaning in favour of implication and the damned thing were addressed to her to frederica
oh hell she said
not to worry said daniel
i push off
i see you
you have seen the picture
i not in the mood
we were going to have coffee in fortnum and mason
no thank you all the same
wednesday january
clare still swapped one night a week off with stephanie and reported subsequent event to gilda who now managed the shoe shop occasionally she visited clare for an evening meal
a clare poured sherry gilda asked so how wa the boac pilot
tony wa the worst yet
clare never felt embarrassed discussing sex with gilda who could talk about little else
he read all the sex manual ever printed
whipped a porn magazine out of his flight case after the first gin and tonic
he wa coldly determined to be a good lover
for me that wa a total
porn picture are a to most woman
woman like word not picture gilda said a she sipped her drink
but i starting to think that everything a for you doll
you clearly ca have sex with fella you ai fond of
i expect you need a chap you know well someone you feel comfortable with not these
she swallowed half the glass
now me i the reverse
if i do give a damn about em i ai anxious and if i ai anxious then i come easy
she drained her glass
when tony could get me to climax he wanted to ask another girl over clare said
he automatically assumed that i wa a lesbian
that not what he meant gilda said
lot of guy find it a to watch two woman making love
how very odd
can you imagine a woman trying to get two men into bed so she could watch them
forget this guy said gilda
i know what you need clare someone you know and trust someone who wo make you feel anxious
then you relax and it happen then you stop being one of them miserable nympho who hop from man to man hoping for mr right the man who can satisfy her
a gilda held out her glass to be refilled she added reflectively although you seem more lonely than horny
are you looking for sex or just someone to talk to
you ai likely to pick up prince charming in a bar
clare said i not looking for prince charming
i do want the disorder the pain the mess or the misery of being in love
i just want a relationship without responsibility
gilda laughed
so do these fella you pick up
but i not convinced that right for you
you need a secure situation with someone you can trust who you know will stick around because he love you
i tell you who you ought to fall in love with clare
who
yourself
you clearly think that you a piece of worthless rubbish and if i pick up those vibe then so do the bloke
why not give sex a rest for a bit and pay a bit of attention to yourself
you never want to make a man the centre of your existence
that place is for you clare
i am the centre of my existence clare sang a if chanting a psalm pitching her voice an octave lower a she pushed josh to her playgroup the next morning
a man stood on the porch his hand in the pocket of his beige mackintosh
good morning
are you a prospective parent
clare asked
she felt in her pocket for the key
no said the man
i an inspector for the local education authority
after examining the bathroom the inspector pointed out that legally one toilet wa required for every seven kiddy
clare said but if each child go there every two and a half hour one lavatory is adequate
there is a potty for emergency
we have never had a problem
the inspector wa not listening
he wa making note on other violation
half an hour after the inspector left a if to prove his point the lavatory refused to flush
the following morning clare playgroup wa ordered to close
two day later clare mind wa unexpectedly diverted from her personal problem no job no man when the cnd office telephoned to ask her for voluntary evening help they were organizing another protest after a nuclear accident
over spain an american bomber carrying an had collided in with another aircraft
the with an explosive capacity of more than a million ton of tnt had fallen into the atlantic ocean off southern spain
clare felt cheered to be back among people doing something worth while
monday february
valentine day brought two happy event
the radio reported that the missing had been located on the atlantic seabed
and to clare delight she sold the lease of the apartment in which she ran her playgroup for a profit of per cent
clare felt a if she had won a sweepstake
on the following morning she bought a portable tv a warm winter coat for herself and new clothes for josh
she did buy any toy for josh because she had decided to open a toy shop
two week later clare bought the short lease of a small shop in the pimlico road close to mr gooden home
though there wa a lot to do clare busy redecorating the shop and visiting wholesaler to buy stock still managed to work one evening a week for the movement
in just before her toy shop opened clare weary amiable national health doctor looked up from his desk and said about your vaginal symptom mr shapiro
you better go to st stephen for test they properly equipped to handle this sort of thing
he seemed uneasy
what sort of thing
not cancer
no gonorrhoea the doctor said apologetically
clare almost fainted from surprise and anxiety horror and shame
then she wept
the doctor refused to give her more sleeping tablet but scribbled a prescription for tranquillizer which were increasingly prescribed for woman like clare with symptom of anxiety in stressful situation such a poverty divorce or bereavement woman with marital problem and woman who were out of work also found them helpful although the pill did nothing to resolve the problem responsible for the initial anxiety
clare who blushed with shame whenever she thought about it waited anxiously for the result of her test at st stephen hospital
the test were negative
but within a month she could get through the day without tranquillizer she felt le anxious calmer
clare managed to open the red rocking horse by
at the opening party an excited josh rode the pretty antique red rocking horse in the shop window
monday august
standing by the swimming pool at saracen miranda beckoned to adam who wa floating on the water in a transparent plastic armchair
in a voice of soft persuasion she said will you do something for me adam
i going to learn to fly
i want you to break the news gently to gran
but you promised your grandmother not to learn to fly adam objected
it wa a condition of her gift to you the ten thousand pound capital to start kit
i did say for ever
i pay the money back to her
miranda wa defiant
i always wanted to fly
i wo be held by a promise that wa unfairly extracted from me before i legally became an adult
and i get bored with nothing to do on holiday but lie in the sun
when are you starting
adam asked resigned
this morning at the cannes flying school
they have english instructor
four hour of instruction a day for two week
and of course this time of year it perfect flying weather
miranda wa triumphant now
i already passed the two written exam
did law and meteorology last easter and now i finished navigation radiotelephony and technical that wa the toughest
so that why you so pale
three hour later two thousand foot above the mediterranean miranda alert and exultant sat next to her instructor at the control of a trainer plane an ugly little rallye which her instructor described a efficient and forgiving you could do something wrong m a rallye without getting immediately punished for it
flying wa even better than she had hoped better than skiing better than driving a sport car
a the rallye droned towards the lighthouse on the tip of cap camerat miranda felt a if she were breathing the air of the god
gently they swooped turned and climbed in the azure sky
after they reached two thousand foot the instructor showed her how to fly level he then encouraged her to experiment with the stick manoeuvring the plane m every direction
miranda felt that the aircraft wa an extension of her arm and her fingertip outspread in flight
heading west on the return flight path the instructor said this is the first time i flown with a pupil and have once needed to touch the control
miranda pushed home this advantage
then can i land
the instructor hesitated then said why not
the girl wa clearly a natural flyer
after being given clearance to land miranda following her instructor direction started her approach she throttled back to reduce speed and control her descent a she flew towards the threshold the point just before she intended to touch down
the plane wa now moving at not much above stalling speed
a the rallye dropped to about thirty foot above the runway miranda throttled back completely and held the stick back
the plane seemed to glide forward and land itself
the undemonstrative miranda flung her arm around the instructor
oh thank you
thank you
quite a smooth landing the instructor said approvingly he hesitated then warned next time be careful not to land too fast or you run out of runway
this woman wa adventurous and ambitious such pilot did not live long
he added careful pilot are the one that survive
a good pilot never take a risk
the opposite of a good businessman miranda said still on a high
a businessman ha to take risk constantly and win sixty per cent of the time
in the air that risk factor would kill you
nine hundred year earlier the great hall had been the hub of castle life wolfhound ate on floor strewn with rush servant slept on straw pallet thrown on the floor
then the winter salon did not smell of lily and expensive leather but of stale fat stinking human body and animal ordure
elinor sometimes thought of all the love and the hatred the treachery and the killing that this hall had undoubtedly seen when strong men fought to the death to protect their woman and child
now the winter salon at saracen where elinor waited for adam wa not only the coolest but the most impressive room in the
high arched wall of pale stone were hung with tapestry around the big stone fireplace where log burned in winter stood sofa covered in the blue and green of the tapestry here and there were lamp flower book and pile of parlour game
what keeping adam
elinor asked buzz who wa adding up the scrabble score
you said three
it only buzz said
for you two hundred and for me
that not a bad score for you nell
buzz never cheated to let elinor win she knew that elinor would immediately sense this and feel humiliated
after an intensive rehabilitation programme of physiotherapy and speech therapy elinor appeared to have completely recovered from her stroke although she could no longer think of three thing at once which buzz said wa a mercy for the people who had to live with her
elinor wa sometimes at a loss for the right word or name and then became impatient with herself she wa often frustrated because she could move a swiftly a she did before
at time she wa downhearted and wondered whether she would ever write another book
when you want to write you write buzz would tell her then
now buzz grunted look what i tore out of the daily mail
she dug into her pocket unfolded a bit of newspaper and read sportsman jim clark today opened a splendidly equipped physical training college at larkwood in wiltshire formerly the family home of the family
lady commented i wish them well
i doubt that
elinor peered at the photograph of the new owner a hero standing with her marjorie
the doorbell sounded
i go buzz said
it either adam or the postman
buzz returned reading a postcard
it for you from sonia rushleigh
whoop i mean bromley
who have thought them two would marry
she say the colonel taken up petit point and miss hawkins is teaching him
remember her the schoolmistress
i do indeed said elinor
frumpy sourpuss
who the letter from
clare
buzz held the envelope out to elinor
elinor shook her head
you open it
it marked personal
i do want to read it unless she apologizes
buzz opened the letter and read it
she shook her head
it just a friendly letter asking how you are
but reading between the line i think clare need money
if she took her poor child back to his father and gave her husband a second chance she would need money
how about a bit of generosity
buzz said
you a silly stubborn old woman
and clare just a stubborn and just a silly
it would have hurt her to say she wa sorry
elinor looked anxious
do you really think she short of money buzz
i would want her to have a rough time
this remark wa overheard by adam a in pale blue shirt and jean he sauntered through the door
he said elinor you allowed ample provision in the trust for helping clare if the trustee consider that help is needed
i check on clare when i get back to london
he put a pile of paper on a side table
there rather a lot of paperwork here thing that you should be aware of
we had more paperwork not le since the trust took over buzz said tartly
and i tell you frankly that i ca follow it adam
i thought the trustee were going to manage the business
elinor should be made to wade though page of paragraph with no comma in em
of course the trustee manage the business and they do it very well adam said
and there no reason for elinor to see any of this if it tire her
in fact i about to suggest something that would simplify matter
what that
buzz asked
i like to substitute paul littlejohn for myself in the power of attorney that i hold on your behalf elinor
i trying to reduce the number of business administrator the fewer there are the simpler the system and the cheaper it will be
doe that mean that paul will be legally responsible for elinor affair instead of you adam
yes but that only a technicality
paul will do a i say
and i also like you to sign this document adam added which absolves me and stg from any further responsibility once paul littlejohn ha been substituted
buzz said but surely
smoothly adam explained the responsibility must clearly rest m only one area
it in your interest to clarify the situation
it customary
if you think that best adam dear
elinor frowned slightly at buzz
adam decided to hold back miranda bombshell until later after elinor drank her evening glass of champagne
just before five when the business session had ended and the afternoon wa still hot quiet and heavy with languor buzz left to get some tea
adam escorted elinor to the elevator after taking her to her bedroom he intended to go to the beach for a swim
in the kitchen surrounded by the smell of mint and basil buzz whistled rose of picardy with much dramatic warbling a she prepared elinor tea
leaf and yellow blossom obscured the top of the window while the bottom wa covered by aggressive pink hollyhock seemingly determined to fight their way inside
sylvie the cook sat at the big kitchen table by the window writing a list and shooing pigeon away
the bane of sylvie life wa the pigeon droppings that littered the windowsill and had to be cleaned up daily
with a shudder sylvie refused a cup of tea
still whistling buzz laid the tray
the soporific calm of the drowsy afternoon wa shattered by the bell indicator above the kitchen door
someone wa jabbing the bell in elinor bedroom
knowing that adam wa probably in the elevator on his way to the beach buzz hurled herself out of the kitchen and ran upstairs
frantically she tore open the door to elinor apartment
in the passage she stumbled and almost fell then flung back the door to the bedroom
to her relief elinor wa not slumped on the floor deathly white she clung for support to the silver brocade hanging of her bed
wordlessly she pointed above the fireplace
buzz turned her head to the left where the portrait of the three sister hung
at first buzz saw nothing but then she gasped in horror
each of the three long creamy neck had been cut horizontally a small triangle of canvas hung downward from each slashed throat

wednesday august
in the foyer of the clanrickard club mike grant leaned against the wall at the bottom of a curving staircase
with his hand in the pocket of his dinner jacket he surveyed the room
it wa going to be a good night in spite of the fact that it wa august and a wednesday
making sure to appear casual he carefully watched the men in dinner jacket and the woman in dress move slowly over the red carpet towards the restaurant at the rear or climb the staircase to the gaming room
mike noticed a group of heavy gambler most of them greek move towards the baccarat room where the sultan of rupolei had been losing for the last hour
his attention wa also caught by a woman dressed in satin and diamond the sister of a ruler she wa known a an audacious gambler
he stiffened a he recognized a man move upstairs with a distinctive boneless saunter he had better send someone up to check the backgammon room
the club owner the casino and the multinational bookmaker knew which professional gambler successfully played game that contained an element of skill such a backgammon and and they preferred to have nothing to do with them ideally the house welcomed inexperienced rich idiot
this is certainly a good night to play the odds
mike heard a sarcastic voice from behind him
he turned and smiled at adam
come into my office for a drink
what up
in mike office furnished with heavily varnished victorian club furniture
adam shook his head curtly at the offer of a chair
i not staying he said
i merely wanted to tell you that you scared the hell out of everyone at saracen except me
so kindly curb your theatrical james bond streak
i knew immediately what your message meant if you do pay up one slash is all it take
he glared at his brother
i thought you were fond of elinor
i seem to recall that elinor helped you to buy your first good bike
why drag her into my problem
you might have given her another stroke
i do know what the hell you talking about and i ca comment until i do
mike his face alert and wary lit a cigarette
adam briefly described how the triple portrait had been slashed and added d you really expect me to believe that you had nothing to do with it
someone told some cat burglar where to find that picture
mike stared at his brother then slowly said not me
i agree it clearly a warning to pay but i swear i know nothing about it
it could have been the brother they be even le subtle
he inhaled deeply
who else do you owe money adam you stupid bastard
no one who do anything so bloody childish
how do i stop this bloody nonsense
how many time must i tell you that if you let thing go too far nobody can stop what will undoubtedly happen
adam mike went on quietly you always taken full advantage of anyone who fond of you
you think you can push me around because you been doing that since we were in the nursery
you also grew up watching grandfather client literally get away with murder
he sucked on his cigarette furiously threw it into the fireplace shoved his hand in his pocket and glared at adam
do you want to be found washed up on the seashore with a few vital bit missing
are you so anxious to know what it feel like to have both eyeball gouged out one at a time
do you want to be slowly battered to death before dying in agony
of course not you bastard adam said
i only want to know who slashed that picture if you did
whoever they are and only you know that these people are serious
punter often try to avoid paying
example often have to be made
you know that
mike started to stride up and down the room
take that fucking urbane look off your face and face reality adam
if you lose money that tough
but if you do pay up that insanity
i had enough of your melodrama adam snarled
mike glared at his brother again
i not exaggerating
remember that incident when the sultan sister had her roll stopped at two in the morning on the grande corniche after leaving the casino
they blew away the chauffeur head with a machine gun
she wa touched
she paid all her gambling debt the very next day
and when the story wa carefully leaked to the newspaper quite a lot of other debt were suddenly settled in full
i not some goddamned sultan sister
no but you also like playing with fire
you never believe that the god will really let it burn you
you think you omnipotent but you are
keep your voice down adam growled
i do what i bloody well like in my own office mike said
do you understand
i on your side adam
you the only brother i have
his voice deepened
i probably more worried about this than you are
if anything happened to you
i be left without you
so for god sake pay up you stupid shit
do think you can get away with it just because you always got away with everything since you set that nursemaid apron alight
i thought you were too young to remember that adam said uneasily
he added she should have left the match within reach of a child
she wa in hospital for six week and i wa the only one who knew it wa an accident
i knew you wanted to see how far you could go
let not argue about something that happened over thirty year ago adam said finally
can you raise money to help me fend them off
i promise you
within six month i know i have no more money problem
never again
you have money problem a long a you gamble adam
annabel wa determined to get a grip on herself and do a scott advised remember a the year she stopped having to go to audition and a the year in which she blossomed into a successful young new york hostess a she met andy warhol lenny bernstein baby jane holzer and all the other fodder
by july annabel wa a junior friend of the metropolitan museum a friend of the museum of modern art and a patron of the bronx zoo
she also allayed her insecurity with a massive spending spree each charity dinner required a new ballgown and each new glittering friend contact for scott required a glittering party
so the year thus far wa a busy one
the long road home
cia hq langley
sorge had never been to langley before
it wa not something a russian expected to do
it wa after when nowak drove him through the gate past the guard and into the vast underground
why langley
sorge had asked him on the way out of washington
they want to show you that they trust you
i do expect i see much
nowak laughed
damn right
we park in the underground catch a special lift to the fifth floor and walk across the corridor into a special conference room
that trust
that trust
the executive director wa already in the meeting room
welcome to langley
he held his hand out in welcome
when the introduction were complete the exec director the dda the ddi sorge and nowak settled themselves round the small conference table
we have a new problem kicked off the exec director
the english operative who wa guarding trimmler ha taken off
he also taken an agent of ours with him
a hostage
a woman
we believe they still in new orleans
why asked sorge concerned
i do know yet
what about goodenache
he decided to turn the pressure on the russian
he caught a flight to frankfurt
he hired a car but the car wa found abandoned on the outskirt of frankfurt
we are trying to find our missing scientist now
are the german authority involved
no
we have our own mean
sorge saw the exec director look up his eyebrow raised suddenly
we both have our method
even in an independent germany
after all it wa the death of our people in these situation that ha brought u together
the exec director shrugged
bastard russian were still upto their old trick
he ignored the pointed look the ddi wa giving him
i thought it best if the director of our operation in new orleans gave you a run down of what ha taken place up to now
he sat back and let the dda give a full report including the trip to the voodoo ceremony and all that followed
sorge did stir even when they mentioned the gruesome spectacle of trimmler arm folded in the sign of a swastika
we still are convinced that trimmler death ha anything to do with the death of our agent
there no definite link
the situation might be clearer when i finished
sorge looked round the table saw their undisguised curiosity
in in germany we had a gru network named the rote kapelle
what that asked the exec director
red orchestra
the nazi called it that because we had radio operator we musician
their leader the chef we called him wa leopold trepper
it wa this group that radioed the warning of operation blue the attack on stalingrad that led to hitler biggest wartime disaster on the russian front
who wa feeding you all this information in germany asked the exec director
official
both in the military and in the government
they saw the damage hitler wa doing
they did disagree with his aim only his method
when they saw that the war could not be won even a early a some of them opened up line of communication with u and the british
we did get that sort of stuff till late into said the dda
you were european
we had century of contact to fall back on
for all their bravery and resourcefulness their information wa often wasted because stalin did believe them
but then he found it difficult to believe anyone
the german with more sophisticated equipment started to track down the musician
even trepper wa captured and the rote kapelle wa wound up at the end of
our information continued for a while but it wa of doubtful origin
trepper wa interrogated by the gestapo and we believed he became a double agent a lot of misinformation wa received in moscow
sorge leant across and finished his coffee before continuing
but we still needed information
the overall network with source inside germany wa the rote drei
the red what said the exec director pleased that he had deciphered the first word of the new
three
the red three
based in switzerland and named after the three transmitter that they used
the most important source of information from agent inside germany wa from a group under rudolf roessler
his wa lucy and his network the lucy ring
roessler or lucy wa a swiss intelligence officer of german extraction
he had many contact in germany
lucy four main contact were major general oster who wa the head of the abwehr admiral canaris who wa later hanged for his part in the bomb plot carl goehdeler who wa leader of the official opposition to hitler and colonel boetzel the commanding officer of intelligence evaluation
there were others but lucy never disclosed any of them to u
even after the war asked the ddi
the lucy ring wa disbanded in after being responsible for some invaluable work
i wo go through all their success but it wa substantial
the british were involved with them through u and it wa their advanced work on breaking cypher that enabled the ring to establish such a great record
but the ring disbanded once more because of stalin penchant for secrecy after moscow tried to bypass roessler and go direct to his number two
so where the link interrupted the dda impatient a ever
it important you understand the background said sorge not allowing the american to get under his skin
nothing further came from the ring until the last few week of the war
with the ally advancing on the eastern and western front many german were out to save their own neck
the lucy ring wa reactivated this time without the knowledge of the british
or the american commented the exec director
i suggest you take that up with comrade stalin replied sorge drily
it wa an impressive list
they did just have knowledge
they also had wealth
in all form
art cash in every form possible
they used the ring because of their line into switzerland
they wanted the security of the swiss bank and the russian bear
one wa dependent on the other
so they bought immunity
while our boy were still getting killed snapped the ddi
a were ours snapped back sorge
but your hand were that clean
you were bringing scientist and others into america just a we were
scientist with nazi record scientist with a history of brutality war criminal
gentleman please said nowak ever the diplomat
can we just stick to what we here to discus
go on dimitri
sorge wa annoyed with himself irritated that he had allowed the intelligence man to get under his skin
of course he smiled back
now ah yes we used the lucy ring
many german with their prize crossed safely into switzerland
they came in car army lorry even an aeroplane
their rich were stored in the bank under private account and then they were brought through czechoslovakia and east germany into the soviet union
all of them asked the dda
those who broke their word were hunted down
and disposed of
some needed reminding that we expected them to honour their word
it wa a cold reminder of their world of the business they traded in daily
we had a large colony of nazi living in the soviet union
they were all scientist in fact we had little use for most of them
they had their own estate and farm to the west of moscow
they kept their secret identity and paid for it through their swiss bank account
but they remained german always dreaming of going back to the fatherland one day
how many nazi did you take to russia after the war
the narodnyi kommissariat vnutrennikh del our people commissariat for internal affair wa responsible for
i never heard of them the dda stopped him
nkvd explained the ddi patronizingly
wiped out twenty million russian for stalin
that right he challenged sorge
more
thirty million
according to official source sorge riposted
a most useful organization
that should shut them up
he felt the look of disbelief pas between the exec director and the dda
the other just watched him the mocking smile still on his lip
he would be the one rostov had warned him to be wary of
he decided to wipe the smile off his face
thirty thousand
that how many east german we deported into the soviet union after the war
the ddi smile disappeared
thirty thousand nazi
jesus
yes
and we kept another hundred and twenty thousand between and in hitler old concentration camp
many were nazi but businessmen and professional were also our target
a third of those died
the others were eventually released and absorbed into the democratic republic
including nazi sympathizer
probably
doe that concern you
sorge shrugged
not really
i wa eight year old at the time
it wa the answer that the ddi expected and sorge regretted his word
he wa here to make joke
the thirty thousand in the soviet union a i said became a community in their own right
without our knowledge over the year with the use of their money and supportive people in the swiss bank they forged contact with those left behind in east germany
they all had one dream
to see a unified germany
to regain what they had lost
they had a amongst themselves
something that linked them wa a reminder of how they had got there
it had to be a safe name innocuous nothing that would draw attention to the past
they remembered the lucy network their gateway out of germany
they called themselves die lucie geister
the lucy ghost
yes
did the organization extend to america
the exec director wa alarmed
how the hell did they
goodenache
i guess he wa one of them asked the ddi
we were sure but in view of his sudden departure i would say yes
which tie trimmler in
and god know who else
the name grob mitzer mean anything
he wa one of their leader
it wa the lucy ghost who supplied him with the cash that helped him build his empire
why did you stop it
damn it you knew about it for long enough snapped the exec director
we did realize how important it wa
we thought they were like any other wartime group nothing more than reminiscence and marching song
old men remembering their youth
the importance of it did surface until germany wa reunified
and it wa only the englishman overhearing the conversation between goodenache and trimmler that finally bridged the gap
so why should the english guy take off with the girl
the ddi changed the subject
he not one of u
i suggest you ask your ally about that
maybe he just an adventurer
no more
you must have cleared him
of course
the exec director did want his dirty washing wrung out in front of this russian
wa there anything else
only that the gdr east germany a it wa is different to the west
there are still many there who have forgotten the war
their attitude is different to u
some are still waiting for the war to end
they a traditional people
many even gestapo working and living normal everyday life
working for the stasi
the ddi reminded them all of the secret police who had run east germany with an iron fist
some yes
others returned to the job they had before the war
within the new germany many of them have become frightened
their secret are no longer safe
most of all they fear the israeli
is frick one of these guy asked the dda remembering the name picked up by adam in new orleans
no lied sorge
his order were quite specific
do ratify any name
they did want the yank stumbling in and screwing up in an attempt to force the issue
so what all this got to do with the death of our agent continued the dda
we not sure
except that a lot of the information we have both lost wa about the lucy ghost
link that with trimmler death goodenache sudden departure for germany and the mention of the lucy ghost during their conversation and i think you will agree that is the strongest lead we have to follow
nobody spoke for a while then the exec director reopened the discussion
ha moscow any suggestion a to how we should proceed
no replied sorge which wa what he been told to say
we hoped you would come up with something
i sure we will
can you tell u the name of some of these lucy ghost cut in the ddi
the one in russia
how high up the ladder did they go
sorge enjoyed his reply
in time yes
but i can tell you you wasting your effort looking for martin bormann in south america
he died twenty year ago
he watched their stunned face across the room
well and truly shafted
they said little after that and sorge wa soon being escorted with nowak down to the underground garage
five minute later they were on their way back to washington
bormann
fucking bormann
they had him all the time said an astonished ddi
believe it
they probably got hitler stashed away too
well it been a real said the exec director
but let not forget we still got a crisis on
find the englishman
that our first priority
find him and see what the son of a bitch is upto
the amtrak crescent atlanta georgia
the train pulled out of atlanta station at four minute behind schedule
they had slept well eaten well slept again and eventually got bored with the passing countryside
adam had insisted they stay in the room and she had found a good enough reason to change his mind
he wa thumbing through usa today for the umpteenth time looking for something he might have missed when he heard her giggling
she wa in the swivel chair reflected in the window with the dark night a a backdrop her head angled towards him
what so funny he asked pleasantly putting the paper down
you sure know how to give a girl a good time
do i he grinned back
according to all the book a secret agent life meant to be glamorous
we spent hour together and in that time i been bitten by bug in a hooker bed tied up a guy with no leg and stolen his wheelchair stayed cooped up in a train for twelve hour with an attractive man and behaved like a virgin
do take that the wrong way
but james bond would handled it differently
he wa scottish
i english
they prefer the ram and bang method
we more sophisticated in our approach
what happens next
in which department
in the department
to nordhausen
that where trimmler said he would meet goodenache
trimmler dead
and goodenache running from the russian
he ca go back there
from what i heard germany wa still their home
and nordhausen wa where they shared something special
they wanted to go there
if goodenache frightened and he want to hide that a good a place a any
nordhausen
where is that
central germany
south of berlin near what wa the old border
an industrial town
it wa also where the nazi built most of their rocket the and during the second world war
from what i remember they moved most of the rocket manufacture down there so that our bomber could get to them
built the factory right in the heart of the mountain
used slave labour
i think a lot of people died in the making of those weapon before they ever got launched and blew up half of london
why would they want to go back there
who know
maybe it wa a job they never finished
but they did
those guy put people into space put our people on the moon
that enough for most people
that wa just their work
and they did do it for germany
they did it for their conqueror
you telling me that all those scientist spent their time in america and could wait to get home
not all of them
most of them became good american
and good russian i suppose
but these two wanted to go home
they never stopped being german
maybe it the only thing they ever dreamt about
weird
is it
to want to go home
all they after is their youth
catching up with what they thought they lost
are we all
she shrugged and looked thoughtful
penny for them he said
i wa uh just being a woman
tell me
thinking of peter
ah
the venerable ex
i know
here u heading for trouble and god know what else and in the middle of you talking about nordhausen i start thinking of peter
wondering what the hell he upto
the emotional mind of a woman
stop knocking yourself
make a change
i usually leave that to you
he burst out laughing
ok tough guy
what got you so tickled
here we are crammed in a small compartment in a train hurtling across america being chased by the cia the fbi and god know who else and you worried about your sex life
christ he must been good
he wa a shit
so why
adam stopped and shook his head
because some of u like shit
do ask me why
she laughed with him
he cheap too
he once bought me a louis vuitton handbag
your travel case reminded me of it when we left the hotel
it wa for our second anniversary
i broke the lock and took it back to the shop in la jolla
they told me it wa a fake
a fucking hong kong fake
can you believe that
what did he say
that he bought it in new york when he wa there on a visit
and if he could remember where the shop wa he go back and sue the bastard
that peter for you
a cheapskate liar and womanizer
and i ca let him go
that really pathetic news

that you had guardian

that right
something like that
he in his usual stoical manner did tell her that he had studiously learnt everything about twin and their relationship
i had a boyfriend in high school
he wa a twin and his brother played on the football team
if he got hurt my guy used to suffer too
we used to watch the game together and i suddenly see him wince in pain
just like that
and i look on the field and it wa his brother who been tackled
yes
something like that
he laughed
i remember once getting a tap round the head from my dad
i done something wrong

if you wan na take it that way
if if labour say get in
if labour get in and they ca fulfil their promise
yes
like john smith made promise then that conservative have done this that and the other he must be able to do them now must he
who must
john smith
well erm they they do know whether they can do it or not do they
no but he criticizing the conservative policy and all that and what we will do is this
i know for investment
yes but they all say that
industry
do they until they get into power
i know
and and then they all
they do
back down
they do
yeah
they say they they probably have got the finance to back up what they what they said they would do
yeah but a a lot of quote gon na be made to them after are there
you know like you said this and you have done it you said that and you have done it and all that sort of
yes but once they in power there nothing you
well
can do about it

no
they they just come out er
with statement
glibly with these these statement
mm
mm
i sure that if there is an easy way of doing it the conservative would have found out and done it
i do think there any any easy way
i do see how they going to do it

i really do
i mean where are they going where are they going to get the extra money from er to pay for the old aged pensioner er eight pound rise
mm

so it be the working people er probably the the national er health stamp have to go go up
it be a sorry day if they get in
it will gordon
oh
i do know
you a real turncoat you are
mm
are you
mm

no but i went to park hospital to see her
because edith now edith wa going away for some unknown reason i do know she must have been going on another holiday anyhow

i think you were teaching at night school

yes i think i did
yes
yes
well i wa only at lillycups from august seventy till august seventy one
yes
only a year
and if you phoned me early in the year it must have been just after we got the v w
yes
i think it wa
just a couple
so
of month after we got that
i think it wa because er co we got iris er er triumph did we
that right
yes
soon after that
yes
i think we did gordon
and you were driving that about
that right
that right
well carl had passed
and you went you went in that triumph did you to the
i did
yes
well it it wa later than seventy one you see
mm
and you had that car about two year did you
oh yes
perhaps a bit longer
two year
yeah
because i came i came to er dellasel
yeah
when carl passed his er to m g s
yeah
do you remember
yeah
blimey
do you mean must be about twenty year ago then
yes
yeah about twenty
this is why you know i i think you should keep i keep diary from year ago because i know you do like nostalgia and i do but it interesting
mm mm
to look up
yes
er event
yes
i mean i got no diary dating back that long
no i know
well i have
i have no record of anything
no
happening then
no
but just one line of thing that you know i do mean a diary where you write a page every night but just two line you know
yeah
all and what you did and when i got the car the date and when you got that triumph then
yeah
you know little just a line
and then when you look at it er you can recall then
oh yes
other thing
that right
the one line sort of set it all off you can remember
that right
yeah
mm
yes but i remember i can remember edith phoning me and and saying you know she wa going away you know is you know could i go down
and i said yes
mm
i co i remember coming coming back i got lost
you know where er that circle is where there the shop well instead of taking i know instead of taking one road i took another and i got completely lost
mm
mm
i would now but then i i i did know er round that area
no that right really i mean if you do know the area you do know which road to take on the island
i know
but i mean you would have thought that er lilly i mean she had no weight on her or anything like
no
that did she
no
she always been active all her life
all been active all her life
no you ca understand how these thing happen
well they give you all these bloody tip and paper about what to do to avoid this and avoid that
and what to eat and everything but
this bloody footballer i mean it a
i know
a really fit man
i know
he er one artery wa seventy percent blocked it wa in the paper
yeah
and the other artery wa ninety percent blocked
wa it really
yeah
yeah
good god
i mean he could have gone any time
graham sounness i mean he only thirty eight
could have gone any time with with nothing through his bloody artery
good god
but that i did know it wa that bad
it wa in the paper this morning
and er
goodness me
well he a he he did smoke
no
he wa an athlete
he been an athlete
he obviously ate like everybody else
mm
and he
i mean
wa overweight in any way
wa overweight what more
no
the bloody hell do you have to do
that incredible that
see they say it wa a it hereditary
well
co his father had a bypass did he
oh did he
i think some other relative died er
oh
youngish
yes
oh well i bet i think perhaps it is really
i know
it still going
i know
yeah and you ca you ca understand it can you really
well look at the old lady that walk past here at ninety one
that right yeah
yeah
and she doe all her own shopping
mm
you know i mean she keep stopping but she she remarkable
she really is
mm
but they few and far between are they
when you like that
yeah
mm
but what i could understand with this this fella that
this sounness
aye
he he found out co he went for to for a check up and they took his blood pressure
yes
and well lot of people go and have blood pressure taken they find it high and they
yes
give them tablet
yes
go home
why did they take it a stage further with him
he got high blood pressure he wa in any pain he living a normal life
similar to what i wa when i went
yes
and they just give me tablet
yes
now why what made them take it to the stage
well er well first
where he wanted a heart bypass
first and foremost he wa in a private scheme
well probably that it then
yeah
and probably because because of his father and er the the other relative having the bypass done
so they took it
mm
a step further but i think probably it because he wa in er er a private scheme
very likely in n it
yes
so there a lot of people walking about with just taking bloody tablet who probably really should have a bypass
ah well i well i would say that really gordon
i mean i think er when your blood pressure wa found out and you been taking tablet ever so i think it kept it all under control and you you we eat a sensible diet
the only the only er thing i complained about with you is is the butter
mm
i do have that much now
but i think everything in moderation but you do eat a much butter now a what you used to
i do eat that much bread you see
no
so i i think really and i think what i think with him i think definitely i think it must be the private scheme and plus that his own family it run in the family
mm mm
must be hell of a shock being told
oh god
it must have been
see how much it costing
two hundred and fifty pound a night
yeah
phworgh
that without the operation
yeah
well he earned three hundred and fifty thousand a year then
oh i know
and plus he he he he he married an heiress you know
did he
er him er they live in spain now
oh er he he worth a pretty penny is sounness
he went in carl shop the other the other week
did he
yes
mm
must have been looking for a house
carl said he he looked er well er his face did it were very he got a very poxy skin
ha he
you mm
yes
he wa having it done this afternoon were he
yeah
some time today
aye
i tell you what that quick int it though gordon
with only going in last night and
mm
having it done today
it is indeed
i wonder how quick they would have got him in though if he would have been in a private scheme
he could wait six month could he
well he could have been dead by then
well er yeah exactly that what they moaning about int it
terrible
put them on a list and wait
i never heard so much talk about health a we do nowadays
oh i know
when i wa young i i do remember talking all the time about bloody health and what you should do and what you should do
no i know
did you
no
but we were educated in in in health though
we just we just lived and that wa the end of it
yes but then you see in the in the old day gordon i mean you you were very fortunate if you got three meal a day and and whatever you got you were glad of and used to eat it all
now we much more affluent and people are educated er
mm
a regard their health
mhm
well having said that gordon your mother lived to a good old age and my mum and my father did
yeah
and they ate all the wrong stuff did they
according to according to what they say now they did
mm
i know
do know who to believe really
when you look at when you look at the some all these a lot of these composer and artist who died long ago and you look the birth range there a hell of a lot at seventy five seventy six
yes
oh there a few at forty odd
mm
but there a hell of a lot well into their seventy
you know and they were born early eighteen hundred
yes
yes
yeah
i know
i know we living longer now generally but i wonder how much
i do know i

well they making five or six hundred they bound
to be getting on with it
that right
that getting in the
i do think they got a lot of staff on
i would have thought they bother with a
no
student night having a lot of staff on it pointless having ah i mean the bouncer in that situation
well you only need one
but we do need a bouncer on
except mind you the the rough the erm rugby club gave the band a bit of er a rough seeing to
what band
he had some band that were awful apparently and the
whole of the rugby team were lying in front of stage with their
they they never left they were playing the rugby club

mm
doe the sugar house get that many people in
no
no
the sugar house only open er thursday friday saturday

i mean we we opened originally first year every night of the bloody week and it wa pointless absolutely pointless
is that bigger than the empire
i never been in it
yeah
no
er yeah
yes it is
is it
it legal it legal
well it on it on a thursday yeah
it it legally bigger than the empire but the empire can get more people in co he got upstairs and
yeah
that
mm
see
but of course erm for licensing they do take that particularly into consideration up there
well they half upstairs straight away
yeah
yeah
so er
i mean i think i i think the empire legally is well i thought it wa nine hundred
seven fifty i think
i ca think er i do know

i mean you could you could
well i thought it wa seven fifty
certainly get seventeen eighteen hundred in there

even that bob monkhouse opened up quite
yeah
quite nice
yeah
well they have the garden wo they
oh yeah

there wa too many
yeah
but i mean they were banging they were banging fifteen hundred in for that disco for the first
mm
few month were they
no twelve twelve or thirteen
they never had fifteen
did they
i mean the sugar house his capacity
just been upped to eleven hundred i think
erm i mean it wa always nine hundred but it been upped to eleven hundred last year i think
well we used to put i mean i put twelve thirteen hundred in the sugar house
but but you it full at that you know
mm
whereas the the the you you could you could you could fit sixteen seventeen hundred
no i reckon there wa they reckon between a a thousand and eleven hundred for a night you know
but you could fucking move at that
yeah but it wa a it wa also a it wa a bit of a celebrity i mean it wa people people were crushed around bloody hell i mean
yeah that right
yeah
all the downstairs i mean all the pleb were upstairs all the downstairs wa erm
yeah but maybe maybe a hundred people
mm

four add four and then
four add four equal eight
two time four equal eight right
yeah like that
and then two
and two time four is eight
erm i did write it like that then
right
share the total of five
yeah i done yeah i done
er
five five five is fifteen
five add five add five
erm is fifteen
and then erm
right
is fifteen
and then
and six
six six

add six add six
add six
add six
is thirty six
right
six time six is thirty
i done that one
six
that it
okay
erm this
i leave that out
leave that out
add them up
mm
that much closer can use those picture
take a look
are they near the box
yeah
is that right
four
four is twenty
so it four so
four time five is
twenty
four time five equal twenty
er two time six equal twelve
er four time three equal twelve
er two addition left
alright
those two add
so it like one two one two and one there and but put like erm seven add seven add seven is
is twenty one
yeah
seven add seven add seven is twenty one
one
and three time seven
right
is twenty one and do it that way five and five
okay
two addition question
hang on
two yeah but you got right two multiple and two addition equation
not equation
you told u this
but like these these are equation
so two addition equation er three time seven plus seven plus seven is twenty one
right
oh
so but you can also go
yeah
yeah add three
three plus three plus three plus three plus three plus three is twenty one
do it that way on
do you follow
yeah
me
yes i do
right
two multiplication
yeah
and two addition
two addition
right
so you like you
yes that right
then it like erm
one
seven time three and three time seven
and three time seven
that right
and you do the same there
same on the add
and then this we do like
right she want currency in two division in each right
so it one two three four
that multiplication is a
yeah well division okay so it twenty one shared by say if that one two three four five six int it
oh i know what i got
six time three is eighteen or three time six is eighteen
i know what i done
i put the i thought it wa er okay
six
and division is shared by
so you got to do eighteen shared by six is three and eighteen
have you got
shared by three is six
so like you go one two three four five six six time you swap
three
six time three
time three is eighteen
is three time six
six
yeah and and you got
six time three and three time six
and division is eighteen shared by three is six and eighteen shared by six is three
yeah
got it
i can not read
three six are eighteen
you got it
and you do the same there
hang on
i have finished thirty three
one yet
that what i do get
why do multiplication equation for this similar line i do get how you do that
is it would you like u to put
it four int it
it four
no two four six eight ten twelve
yeah
it
that two
no but it going to four look
it going to four
alright
going into four
what would i put
er one four is four two four are eight and three four is twelve
a this is been shared by line int it
yeah and it on that one
you do it like that do you
yeah co it being shared by
oh
so it i would say that is er nine time four equal thirty six
and on that one is er sixty three shared by nine six time sixty three divided by nine
four
no
sixty three divided by nine is six
write six through it
ten six in n it
no it ten six
no no wait a minute
nine
what should nine time ten emma
one nine is nine two nine are eighteen three nine are
twenty seven
four nine are thirty six five nine are forty five six nine fifty four seven nine are sixty three
oh thank you
right
yeah seven nine are sixty three
hang on a minute
six nine are
seven nine are sixty three
hang on a minute
seven
seven nine are sixty three
sixty three
yeah
you work them out like that look
yeah
well seven nine well ee er it take you so long
look one one nine is nine
yeah
two nine are eighteen
so that one there is six into thirty six
i know
but i still do get what you have to write
well multiplication equation for this number line i would say is er i already told you that
no but i do know what i have to i have to write
eight time four equal thirty six
do get it
because it one two three four five six seven eight no sorry nine time four is thirty six
nine time four equal thirty six
like this look
write it out on a piece of paper and you and i write them down
no
you do it yourself
i told you what to do
you do it like that
i do get it though

well what is it tomorrow morning and evening and thing
what
what is it tomorrow morning and evening and what are we going to do in the afternoon without

i know we cope but what are you going to do
are we inviting anyone
i know we not inviting anybody for lunch christmas day could cope with that but it would be quite to have them in the afternoon ca cope with the people
oh yeah
suppose we should do something yeah
well that what i wa thinking perhaps we could go with somebody somewhere
you know like by a canal or something
perhaps well if it snowing it wo be quite the same
that right
conducive to tripping about
but if it quite nice weather it would be nice to invite somebody along i expect
they could just
stratford
yeah the stratford warrior running about every six week something like that
is it six week since we saw the last one then
they did they they have them more frequently now and they getting even more and more infrequent now for the rest of the year
mm
and next one
that mother day twenty second
is it
no
mother day a fortnight
twenty ninth
somebody will organize a party for tuesday
yeah they want a party piece on tuesday
it alright you do have to of cake
if i do bake them now my mother
yeah well tell your mother
i have to
yeah i will
get one
and it better be a nice one
pop into mark and spencer they have some amazing shape in mark and spencer that the child will enjoy
really
mind you it might be expensive
tesco are probably cheaper
you remember that tom and jerry i got for tim
because i could be bothered to cook it
well leave it up to me i see what i can get i get for the party
thank you dear
is that alright
yeah
i get you some
and i just make the rest of the with salad in
you not supposed to
i told you what we gon na for christopher have i
i know he went to school to do
yeah
housework
is that naughty
thursday morning
right christopher will be back too
i wish i could i like to
you what
out at the meeting again on monday night
on monday
where are you going monday
going to sue house
oh right the big housewife
the housewife mhm
like cooking this week
ah i having jane for a piano lesson are i
what day
which day
monday
are you
oh well
so that fit in quite well i could remember what i wa doing on monday but we said sort of tentatively monday would be probably quite a good day i think
better than thursday anyway
so could tuesday night be inspector morse night
yeah co my mum will be here then
oh right can we not take her home
unpaid
well she
we shall see
have been here all day wo she
so she might want to go home
she want to tell u all about her wedding
could you tell her we going to watch inspector morse
for the third or fourth time
will she have watched inspector morse
she wo of watched it co it bound to be on a wednesday night
doe she like inspector morse
i do think she watch it normally
no she probably doe like it
a bit spicy
i bet she would she love anything like that
bit of a body
mind you it might be too complicated
it wa i remember reading in the paper that it been it been filmed at a house which no one ever been allowed to go in even the great sort of one of these country mansion it wa not
right
and even people who write about
if it wa not it ca be again they always going in there
well that fine
it wa some country mansion in oxfordshire you know
mm
it a you come off the
and how did
and
they get permission then
they somehow managed to persuade the owner apparently it wa and it wa and nobody else had ever been allowed in this place not even erm historian who write about famous building even they had been refused access
where is it
somewhere in oxfordshire
oh
they do know where
oh
so
this wa about last week episode
i think it wa about last week but they seem to imply that it wa last week episode that would
oh
do it
we seem to have got one spare video if we do get it watched before wednesday
alright
well that the only chance
oh yeah co we going to maryland tomorrow
your dad
mm
erm not it wa about your dad it wa about my birthday co
co
he realized that it wa my birthday and what did i want
so i said send me a cheque and i go and shop
and
and last week co she quite generous is she
she is a bit but it
no i did say anything
i think that the thing
so your dad sent a cheque
anyway i asked her if she heard from your dad and she ha heard from your dad apparently on friday he went to the consultant
mm
and next week he got his first well she did know whether it wa radiotherapy or chemotherapy
and she said he ha to go trotting to exeter two or three time a week now
mm
i do know how long it going to go on for or what it is exactly but i thought it would be a good idea to ring your dad up and see
mm
but at least thing have moved and at least they gone round
so i pleased really are you
interesting that they done it so quickly is it
after seeing him because he thought that once he seen the consultant it would then take some time to get the treatment started but they must have got themselves over that
yeah
well i mean everyone
yeah
i think
got ta get moving
and presumably whatever it wa the gp had give him ha had upset that thrombosis again
i do know whether to ring him tonight oh it too late tonight now
it much too late
perhaps we could ring tomorrow afternoon when the child are up
well they love talking to them on the phone do they
i know they do
we could can prime them up on what to say and type of thing to talk about so they do get moaned down or something
bogged down
so he had to go in what did you say
three time a week
i do know she just said
something like that
a few time a week and i think it sounded like three co she wa wondering how he would cope with driving and everything
mm a trial
well i hope not i mean no he wo be able to drive
but presumably your mum can do that for they got hundred of people there he always driving people everywhere
that right
so i do see why they ca drive him
i sure they will
yes
co they very good are they
i mean look at that woman doing her er from the from the church
at time like this it would be nice if we lived nearer could help out
it would nice if we lived there but we ca so
it about
and write a well
yes
double dose
yes
and pulled out
well it sort of pulled out but at least it
we be paying for it a well
and it hard a well
we been paying anyway so it must of you know
what doe erm you see er eileen and she having chemotherapy is she
by by medication is
that right
well she take all these tablet thing
that right she ha a sort of massive dose every now and then
and that make her feel what
she not in pain is she
more sort of dopey
i would care if they made me dazed
yeah

yeah
i du n no
not gon na
difficult to know
oh yes that wa it
i wonder how bad it is that feeling like we do really know how bad it is do we
no
perhaps he will be able to say you know
but whether he tell u over the telephone you think ask
i think he would would he
i think so
co we got the agm in two week time
mm
and we voted all these people that are here
what type of this
well you just
it doe matter
you just come along do you find out
what we do with all the money and you find out who doing what and who doing you know
