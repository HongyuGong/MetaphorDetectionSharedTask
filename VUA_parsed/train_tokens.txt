latest corporate unbundler reveals approach roland franklin who is leading a pound bid for drg talks to frank kane
by frank kane
it seems that roland franklin the latest unbundler to appear in the uk has made a fatal error in the preparation of his bid for stationery and packaging group drg
he has not properly investigated the target dining facilities
the head of pembridge investments through which the bid is being mounted says rule number one in this business is the more luxurious the luncheon rooms at headquarters the more inefficient the business
if he had taken his own rule seriously he would have found out that drg has a very modest canteen at its bristol head office
there are other things he has on his own admission not fully investigated like the value of the drg properties or which part of the drg business he would keep after the break up
when the bid was launched last week mr franklin faced some criticism from city commentators on both those counts
he regards the charges as unfounded
on property he is blunt
i do not regard property profits as earnings
we have made a bid of nearly for a company with a book value of we acknowledged there is some extra worth there but i can not see the sort of value they are talking about in property
if they can prove it is there we might pay for it
on the other criticism he is equally dismissive
that point about the core business is very unfair he says
it is difficult to decide when you are an outsider what the business is like
we would eventually like to do it along with the management within the philosophy we will impose
the franklin philosophy was learnt in the us leveraged buyout business at the side of sir james goldsmith
mr franklin went there at the end of the after the collapse of keyser ullman the merchant bank where he was a director that was rescued by the bank of england
he feels that keyser problems were hastened by an unwise acquisition
he went to the us because goldsmith decided that if you wanted to be a capitalist the uk and france were not the places to be
along with sir james he found the us much more attractive taking over and breaking up some fairly hefty us corporations
he rejects charges that he was partly responsible for the casino atmosphere that gripped us corporate life in the early
we stirred it up yes but we never lost any money for anybody and we never added to the unemployment figures
what he has learned from goldsmith the only genius i have ever come across is that the holding company is not the most important unit of corporate organisation
the concept of the company does not interest me it the businesses that are important
it does not matter whether or not drg makes sellotape or basildon bond it of no consequence to anybody if somebody else makes them
and there is always the ultimate unbundler defence that he will make money for his backers
in a takeover campaign that has already seen vitriolic language he responds to the charge that he is mounting the bid to enrich himself and his friends by saying nobody could take that as a criticism this is an investor group
it would be a criticism if i was doing it to impoverish myself
letter policy and politics at the labour party conference
from mr david soskin
sir i was interested by your juxtaposition of poll predicts majority for labour with tories hold on september the latter referring of course to the conservative victory in wandsworth the significance of which appears to have been almost totally ignored by the media
electors are always prepared to criticise the government in answer to pollsters questions but when the same individuals arrive at the polling booth they simply can not bring themselves to vote labour into power
letter policy and politics at the labour party conference
from ms molly meacher
sir despite a significant gap in the labour party education and training proposals their objective to double the number of in education must be welcomed september
england rate stands at per cent according to the latest statistics available
this compares with per cent in the us per cent in sweden per cent in west germany and per cent in japan
to add the education and training statistics to those figures does not improve our relative position
labour hopes to transform the situation by increasing the number of to five for the brighter youngsters and providing grants for training courses two years in a further education college followed by two with an employer for the rest
these reforms will only achieve their objective if accompanied by the implementation of the education act provision for compulsory or education or training up to the age of
this clause has never yet been activated
the sharply reduced number of will inevitably lead employers to bid up the wages of that age group to entice young people away from education and into unskilled or jobs
employers must be required to release for education and training for at least two days per week
only then will two vitally important and complementary goals be achieved to improve britain general educational and vocational competence and hence our productive capacity and to reduce our gross educational inequalities between the elite who receive a narrow education to a very high standard and the rest
letter policy and politics at the labour party conference
from mr john pertwee
sir labour does not need a commitment to proportional representation in order to scoop most of the centre ground at the next general election
all it needs is to promise a investigation such as a royal commission into the practicalities of an alternative voting system surely justified by the intense public interest now abounding
such a promise would be the only hope of a breakthrough for the disenfranchised voters and would have them flocking to the polls for mr kinnock
his problem will be that mrs thatcher might decide to do it first and then she will garner the votes
letter policy and politics at the labour party conference
from mr denis macshane
sir if labour is to suggest the setting up of a specialist labour court september then such a momentous change in the industrial relations system deserves more discussion and needs to be taken out of the of labour party conference politics
for three reasons such a move should be welcomed
first it would bring britain into line with the best european practice notably in germany where local regional and federal labour courts handle problems in a fair dispassionate way based on law precedent and judicial expertise in the labour field
second it would ensure that workers enjoyed positive rights under law and reduce the emphasis of union immunities
labour law will always reflect the balance of power in society and a fully fledged labour court system will not remove class and fundamental differences
but it should be possible to create and enforce enough common rules to prevent the absurd of industrial relations legislation we have seen since
third a labour division of the high court would contribute to the process of constitutional reform in britain which surely is to be a key political issue in the
the trade union question would cease to haunt the labour party and while that might upset some conservatives it would be good for the country
letter independence of
from the rev nerissa jones
sir on saturday you published an advertisement for the extra pages of news and features that you the independent will carry from october
what do independent experts say about our extra pages asks the advertisement
the supposedly jokey answers are illustrated by photographs of people sleeping outside covered by copies of the independent they look like some of the hundreds of visitors who come to st botolph crypt centre for homeless people every day
given the already appalling and growing rate of homelessness and lack of hostel facilities in london when more people than ever will not only have to endure the freezing nights of the coming winter on the streets but perhaps permanent homelessness it was terrible to see the situation being exploited for a joke by your advertisement just the thing now the evenings are drawing in
the added coverage is exactly what i wanted
how much independence do you suppose a person has who exists on the giro of a week
letter ec immigration checks on trains
from the rev gilmore
sir the contents of sarah helm article immigration checks to be made on trains september are extremely worrying
during the recent european community elections the representatives of ec governments promoted the ideal of a europe by
now it would appear from this article that this ideal is shattered and a europe is on the cards
one for those who travel by aircraft and one for those who travel by train between london and paris
the presence of immigration officials and police on board trains is comparable to the scenes of america where migrant labourers were turned back at state boundaries
what criteria would police and immigration officials use in their search for potential terrorists on a train that they could not use at a static checkpoint or airport
do terrorists or illegal persons travel exclusively by train
this is a clear example of the extension of the prevention of terrorism act where criteria for stopping questioning and searching are purely subjective to the official involved
will a person accent dress or skin colour indicate the potential terrorist or for that matter football hooligan or drug pusher
this is a recipe for fear and anxiety
it may mean the detention of innocent people and indeed their imprisonment
letter cardinal sins
from mr jimmy donoghue
sir the publishers of viz are nearer the truth than they realise with their soccer strip september
cardinal hume has not only the cross of being a fervent newcastle united supporter to bear he is also known to irreverent members of mayfair jesuit farm street church by his initials george basil hume
latecomers who continue to hope
from anne applebaum in warsaw
dozens more east german refugees arrived outside the west german embassy yesterday seeking asylum and passage to the west including some who missed by only a few minutes a train that took more than of their compatriots to west germany
many of the new arrivals who waited in the street outside the embassy said they were convinced there would be another train for them
the one they missed pulled out from warsaw east station at yesterday carrying cheering east germans bound for the rhine region of west germany
once upon a time another german government let lenin cross another germany in a sealed train on his way to russia
more than years later lenin heirs are allowing refugees from their communist regime escape in the opposite direction in an east train travelling across east german territory
among those leaving was cornelia a young east berliner destined she said for west berlin via a very circuitous route
i still do know if my family know where i am or if they will suffer from my decision
but i saw no other way out i did know if i would ever have a chance again
some of the refugees had been living in polish exile for as long as seven weeks while others arrived only a few hours before west german diplomats announced they could leave
only two failed to go a new mother and her child who was born in a polish hospital four days ago
the east german government decision to let the refugees leave across their own country came as a surprise to many including some west german diplomats
some of the refugees originally refused to touch east german territory again but were reassured when two of the west german diplomats said they would accompany the train to ensure that the rules were followed
during the journey east german officials will enter the train and collect all east german passports
west germans will then issue new ones
legally the refugees have been expelled from east germany meaning that under current rules they can not return
according to unofficial reports the arrangement was designed by the west german foreign minister hans dietrich genscher the new polish foreign minister krzystof skubiszewski and the soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze who met recently at the united nations in new york
communists allow burial of montenegro last king
from marcus tanner in cetinje yugoslavia
the people of montenegro yesterday welcomed home the remains of nicholas i their first and last king after years exile in italy in belated fulfilment of his last will and testament
thousands of montenegrins many in national costume waited at the quayside in bar for the italian warship that would bring him home
then they formed a slow procession behind the coffin into the mountains to the old royal capital of cetinje for his reburial in the monastery there
what was surely the last ever montenegrin royal event was masterminded by the republic new communist leadership which has abruptly stopped describing nicholas as a class enemy to ride the same wave of popular patriotism and royal fervour which swept serbia in the recent celebrations of the anniversary of the battle of kosovo
the latest biography now calls him an outstanding statesman warrior and man of letters
if i die abroad in exile let my body rest in a temporary grave until my mortal remains be transferred to our dear homeland said the montenegrin president branko kostic reading the royal will and testament to the crowds in cetinje square who carried flags and portraits of nicholas and his queen milena
today the people of montenegro fulfill the wish of their first and last king guided by innate love and respect for their history he went on
our tourist organisations are counting on big profits said srdan darmanovic a member of the montenegrin central committee
this will be good for the montenegrin economy too
montenegro young and leadership which came to power this year amid furious popular dissatisfaction with the old men in grey suits sponsored the gathering of nicholas surviving relatives the first royal reunion organised by a communist government
a letter dropped through the post from the president of the socialist republic of montenegro inviting me to the funeral said john kennedy a conservative party member who lives in barking and is a distant relative of nicholas
montenegro sudden rehabilitation of nicholas memory is a popular move
he liberated us from the turks and fought for our independence said a small boy who waited at the quayside amid a jostling crowd of former monarchs visiting serbian bishops and television crews
marko radoman and a veteran of both balkan wars was given a place at the front as one of the few with personal memories of nicholas reign
for a man whom rebecca west a contemporary balkan observer called repulsive and treacherous for deserting his serbian king alexander in the first world war it is a view of history
nicholas was known as the uncle of europe for his success in marrying his beautiful but penniless daughters into the grander royal houses of russia serbia and italy
this furthered his ambition to rule a large south slav kingdom when the ottoman empire finally collapsed
one daughter a grand duchess of russia even gained a footnote in history by introducing an unknown monk rasputin to the russian tsarina alexandra
in his minute inaccessible capital which today has only inhabitants nicholas erected a miniature european court and an exquisitely furnished victorian palace
he even persuaded european powers to turn cottages into full embassies
it was a fair achievement in a town which an earlier observer described as hovels
but nicholas grand design collapsed in when his serbian alexander deposed him and incorporated montenegro into yugoslavia
obituary virgil thomson
by peter dickinson
virgil thomson was a composer and writer of originality courage and wit formed by a unique mixture of american and french influences
thomson was born in kansas city in studied at harvard and then mostly lived in paris until
his missouri childhood gave him access to baptist hymns and church music but at harvard he was introduced to the writings of gertrude stein and the music of erik satie
these influences laid the foundations for the blend of the naive and the sophisticated which is the hallmark of thomson maturity
like many young american composers he studied with nadia boulanger but after set out to achieve the discipline of spontaneity which he found in stein writings
when he collaborated directly with her in opera the result was of historical significance
first came four saints in three acts produced in and then the mother of us all which demonstrated a new kind of plotless opera only now reaching a wider currency through the stage works of philip glass
in four saints thomson informality was given free reign since he first of all improvised the music at the piano then when it stuck wrote it down to a figured bass
he said i had wondered whether a piece so drenched in anglican chant running from gilbert and sullivan to morning prayer and back could rise and sail
but the resulting mixture of hymns folksy tunes and recitatives at times of intoxicating banality was a sensation
the opera like gershwin porgy and bess the following year used an cast and the staging and choreography gave it a british connection since it was by frederick ashton
the mother of us all shows more continuity but again much depends upon production in what is still a largely opera
in three years before aaron copland thomson started writing film scores which were a model of unobtrusive clarity and pertinence combining american materials to suit documentaries such as the plow that broke the plains and the river with the musique approach of satie
his score for the film louisiana story was awarded the pulitzer prize in
another response to a visual stimulus was thomson series of musical portraits of people such as picasso and aaron copland
the first of these was written in and they number about
just as thomson transferred stein literary abstraction to music so these portraits unusually employ the painter technique of drawing the sitter from life an ideal combination of thomson habit of immediate response with an actual subject
the results are terse and sharply etched like the best line drawings
thomson could control words with the same fastidiousness as notes
he always felt that effective musical criticism began by being well written and he never lost his liveliness
one never quite knew what he was going to say next
he started by writing occasional articles but in he wrote the state of music a trenchant and provocative assessment of the machinery of the musical profession at the time
from to he wrote regularly for the new york herald tribune and four volumes of his notices have appeared in book form
he wrote a fulsome autobiography characteristically entitled virgil thomson on virgil thomson and a personal survey american music since appeared in followed recently by a selected edition of his letters
as both composer and critic he touched both sides of the coin a climate of receptivity is what the artist most desires
it is also a thing that even the most experienced reviewer can not always offer
thomson judgements about music were not always as accurate as his confident expression implied he invited discussion
above all he restored the focus of music criticism onto the music itself
he made no secret of his francophile enthusiasms in reaction to the earlier domination of american music by germans and he was one of the first writers to register the importance of jazz
he fearlessly attacked convention which caused problems when he pitched into established reputations
it has become increasingly apparent that thomson belonged to the american experimental tradition
he anticipated some of the enthusiasms of john cage whom he first met in
a few years later thomson recognised cage as the most original composer in america if not the world and cage repaid the compliment by writing the works section of a monograph on thomson
but finally in spite of their common roots in satie and stein thomson felt that cage aesthetic was destructive
thomson songs contain some of his finest work
there are stein settings such as portrait of fb but also cycles such as five songs from william blake prayers and praises and a cantata based on poems by edward lear
thomson was also prolific in instrumental music on both chamber and solo scale
for many years thomson lived in new york in his apartment at the chelsea hotel
from there like a buzzard in its eyrie he would make forays round the us and abroad in spite of his advanced age
he seemed a genial and indestructible landmark in the history of american music in spite of defective hearing which had bothered him since the late seventies
he had a photograph of himself on his postcards and he signed his letters following the original tailpiece everbest
thomson came from a generation of american composers which had to find its own way without benefit of university patronage
in that kind of free market he thrived and survived and so will the best of his work
obituary thomas keller
by hugh matheson
thomi keller is the outstanding figure in the history of international rowing
he was president of fisa federation internationale des societes the world governing body for years and most of this body attitudes and practices reflect the force of his strict but genial personality
most athletes first encountered him as a voice bellowing in fury at officials who had broken rules or arrangements designed to make racing safer or more fair
he was elected to succeed gaston mullegg as president of fisa when he was and still competing in the swiss rowing team
he did not loosen his links with the athletes when projected upwards into the presidency
provided their behaviour was sportsmanlike and safe oarsmen found only encouragement and humour from a president who was always among them
keller zurich upbringing made him into a skiier and sculler and he raced for the grasshopper club
he competed for the swiss and team at the student winter games and later concentrated on single sculls
in he was swiss sculls champion and finished third in the european championships before moving to manila to work for his family private multinational company eduard keller ltd for four years
on his return keller was swiss champion again in and was bitterly disappointed when the swiss chose to boycott the olympics after the russian intervention in hungary
fisa was then a relatively unimportant body which organised european and other championships and participated in the running of olympic regattas
as a rich forceful young man keller had been earmarked as a likely future president even before mullegg was killed in an aircrash in
rowing was transformed in the breadth and depth of participation over the years of his term
he sat on the appropriate boards of the international olympic committee and was president of the general assembly of international sports federations for years
these positions were not held for his own status but to promote the cause of rowing where it needed clout
he successfully defended rowing as an olympic sport and in introduced women events which have now expanded to six classes
his personal preference for sculling over rowing assisted the introduction of quadruple sculls to world championship and olympic competition
keller was made a steward of henley royal regatta in a time when the proliferation of new courses around the world which had emerged under his guidance seemed a threat to the regatta founded in
but it was the spirit of henley with huge crowds enjoying amateur sport presented with administrative finesse which keller took as the yardstick for the international circuit
he loved the place and he returned every year to play an often small part as umpire of races between undistinguished clubs far below the olympic standard he was obliged to administer
he said this summer that as he gradually wound down his involvement in sport henley would be the last thing he would give up
during his term as president of fisa he gradually reduced his role in eduard keller ltd and used the company offices to provide a world headquarters for rowing
the sport is now obliged to find income from the more normal sources of television and sponsorship to replace his largely unacknowledged private patronage
in spite of his gift to the sport keller was anxious not to abuse his status as president and never went to a rowing event unless invited
because of this he had never seen the oxford and cambridge boat race until this year
he was enthralled by the entire proceeding and remarked that only the english could make a contest between two crews which would not rank in the world top into a bigger spectacle than the olympic final
the final task he set himself for his presidency which was due to end next year was to weed out of the regatta calendar all the rowing courses which could be made unfair by the wind
he had recently travelled from tasmania to norway in search of the perfect metres of flat water
it was a blessing that in response to congratulations on the superb world championship regatta at bled in yugoslavia three weeks ago he was able to reply yes and best of all the conditions were fair throughout
the labour party conference cook appeals for labour to accept electoral reform
by colin hughes and colin brown
an impassioned appeal for labour to back electoral reform was made by a leading shadow cabinet member yesterday after the national executive decided overwhelmingly to oppose a proportional representation motion
robin cook a member of the national executive and the health spokesman said that a labour government which sought to force its programme on an unwilling nation would be unsocialist
he told a labour committee rally that it was not enough for labour to win the next election
it would also be necessary to smash the decrepit effete constitution that allows a minority to capture power and then use it ruthlessly in the interests of the privileged few
mr cook argued that years of thatcherism had been forced on most people who had never voted conservative and that many of those who opposed pr in the labour party wanted to use the same undemocratic power to ram socialism down the throats of a majority who did vote for it
advocates of the system argued that it was the only way of delivering strong government mr cook said
but after years of tory rule he had had enough of that approach to politics
labour would be acquiescing in a democratic outrage if it continued arguing that because the conservatives had got away with being undemocratic for so long it was now labour turn
mr cook also countered the argument that pr would build in a pull towards the centre ground preventing labour from implementing a radical programme
it seemed strange to make that argument mr cook said when it was clear the whole policy review process was designed to placate the centre ground
i can not honestly see that a system which would require us to compromise the morning after the election is really so morally inferior to a system which has already obliged us to compromise our policies two years before polling day
his speech however came aftera vote in the national executive to oppose a proportional representation motion which will be debated on thursday
the four were mr cook ken livingstone john evans and clare short
mr livingstone said he was against pacts but years of thatcherism had demonstrated the dangers of giving power to elites
however neil kinnock the labour leader and roy hattersley his deputy both opposed the motion
mr hattersley said giving disproportionate power to small minority centre parties would not improve democracy
mr kinnock said it was wrong to propose a fundamental change in the voting system for a tactical vote to get rid of the thatcher government
the only way to remove the government was for labour to win the next general election
mr kinnock intends to reinforce his conviction that labour is in a position to win in his keynote speech tomorrow
party organisers want the conference to show that the party is united as never before leaving mr kinnock free for the first time to sell the policy package to voters without worrying about splits
there is expected to be a close vote on defence but mr kinnock is confident the new policy will be affirmed today
the executive is recommending rejection of a motion calling for unilateral disarmament
it is also urging the conference to oppose a motion supported by the national union of mineworkers to commit a labour government to abolishing all nuclear power within years
there could also be controversy over the executive rejection of demands for the age of consent for homosexuals to be reduced to years
pub rock rock n rollers jim white selects the best of the london pub venues and gigs in the weeks ahead
by jim white
general tips a general rule for pub rock patrons is that the quality of music will be in inverse proportion to the quality of the beer except at finsbury park sir george robey where an excellent music policy comes complete with a decent pint of guinness
another rule of thumb is that if the act is obliged to rest their microphone stand and amplifiers on beer crates instead of the stage it will be a good evening
there are two types of pub rock occasions those like the one described above where the band is likely to suffer from agrophobia and those where the pub is so crowded death through asphixiation seems to be the only way to get out

ripping yarns and moral minefields allan and janet talk ahlberg talk to celia dodd about their bestsellers for children
by celia dodd
these days no one questions the importance of good books for the
but books that appeal to adults too are just as important we are after all the ones who have to do the reading
there are few things worse than being bludgeoned into reading a book you hate
should be one of the great joys of parenthood a real meeting of adult and child minds
with the ahlbergs books it very often is
the partnership behind such classics as the jolly postman burglar bill and the baby catalogue win children over with ripping yarns and a wicked sense of humour
they win their parents over with a vision of the world which is decidedly reassuring
their books are usually set nostalgically in the past the thirties and forties are favourite periods and often feature the perennial characters of fairy tales and nursery rhymes
yet they are saved from sentimentality by the wry humour of both text and pictures
the ahlbergs have been accused of not facing up to the harsh realities of life of being too cosy and sweet but their latest picture book bye bye baby published today breaks the mould
in it a small child roams the streets talking to strangers until he finally goes off with a woman who has been wandering about pushing an empty pram
curious subject matter for a children picture book you might think and hardly guaranteed to win the approval of the children book world
but the ahlbergs have no time for literal interpretations of their work
how they argue would alice or the wind in the willows stand up against such scrutiny
the way to look at bye bye baby they insist is as a light surreal comedy
certainly if you bring a literal interpretation to the story it a minefield allan ahlberg says
bye bye baby gets away with its particular minefield thanks to the sleight of illustrator janet ahlberg hand
the visual inspiration for the book was the famous advert for shoes showing a small boy and girl walking off down a avenue an innocent image if ever there was one
the ahlberg version features a solitary figure
the advert gave the story its vaguely thirties setting
the success of the ahlbergs working relationship must have a lot to do with their long and happy marriage
in spite of apparently incompatible personalities she is small and shy he is large and does most of the talking they have an empathy which is essential to the way they work a persistent mutual pestering
the strength of the partnership is highlighted for allan who also works with a number of other artists
the nature of janet part in the process combined with a bad back which prevents her spending more than a couple of hours at the drawing board every day means she can not keep up with her husband prolific output
with other illustrators i work at a distance we visit and phone but there is a point at which i ca pester them any more allan says
they see themselves not as author and illustrator with separate roles but as a partnership of contributing equally to the process
allan ahlberg says in the past a lot of children books seemed to be the work of talented illustrators whose pictures looked brilliant framed in a gallery but when you tried to read the book there was nothing there because the words started as a to hang pictures on
given the importance they place on the interrelationship of words and pictures the couple working lives are surprisingly separate
they claim to see each other less than couples who go out to work meeting for the occasional cup of coffee in the kitchen
their daughter jessica who is likely to be seen with her head buried in the beano or a roald dahl novel has provided the inspiration for many of her parents books
as a baby she was fascinated by the mothercare catalogue and so the baby catalogue which documents the paraphernalia of the infant small world in minute detail was born
allan experience as a primary school teacher is another rich source of ideas
the couple still maintain close links with local schools where they spend hours researching sketching and absorbing jokes
after years of teaching allan had had enough
i ran out of steam
it a killing job
little kids eat you alive they want so much physically and emotionally
every year he would have half a dozen and in his class who could barely read
he treated reading as a team effort getting them to read the daily mirror rather than the dull babyish books on offer
these days he writes the books intended to help children learn to read
a lot of books used in schools are technically readable but rather drab stories
there no reason why they should be funny or gripping even if they do use many words
writing books for children is becoming increasingly complex as the arbiters of the modern child mores librarians teachers and publishers lay down ever more stringent criteria
the problem with children books increasingly is that there are armies of people who are properly concerned with for example the way girls were always discriminated against in the past says allan
that is bad and must be thought about
but people seem to think that stories are written to a prescription that you sit down and say you do want it to be sexist you do want it to be racist
in reality you just invent a tale as if you were sitting round a fire in a cave
in fact and seem to come naturally to the ahlbergs
their books are full of female breadwinners and new men changing nappies and comforting bawling babies in the small hours
although they are a principled pair they once turned down the smarties award on moral grounds the ahlbergs reject the notion of children author as moralist
i would say just sit down and tell a good story and to hell with the morality allan ahlberg declares
with that characteristically strong statement he puts his finger on the secret of the ahlbergs phenomenal success with adults and children alike
the revolution the countryside needs christian wolmar says britain is lagging behind in setting up telecottages
by christian wolmar
the information technology revolution has left large swaths of rural britain untouched
the only computers in many villages are those owned by the teenage boys of the affluent to play their games
ashley dobbs an engaging young entrepreneur is setting out to change that by creating a nationwide network of telecottages
this clever name with its neat evocation of new and old describes a concept which was developed in sweden and is spreading to rural areas across the world
in mr dobbs words a telecottage is a room in a village filled with computer communications that can be used by local people to learn and work
the equipment consists of perhaps four word processors a modem a laser printer able to produce output a fax and a photocopier
software programmes for publishing word processing accounting and business planning are also essential
mr dobbs who is chairman of telecottages uk warns possible users not to get bogged down with the technology the equipment is a tool to overcome what needs to be done
people must think that because there a computer they got to think of a use for it
he reckons there are no shortages of possible uses farmers can use it to do their accounts women with responsibilities can work in their own time on the word processors publicity material for local craftsmen can be produced and so on
this may sound utopian but it has been borne out by the experience of existing telecottages
so far about have been established mainly in scandinavia but also in japan and several third world countries
as the network expands so do the uses
the first was opened in the village of vemdalen in the remote forests of sweden in september
the impact according to henning albrechsten president of telecottages international who has been involved in their development since the outset was immediate
by holding open meetings for children and having the telecottage above the local store people of all walks of life came in entrepreneurs and their spouses shop assistants craftspeople and children
now per cent of the village regularly uses telecottage and at least per cent has taken courses there
britain is lagging behind
no telecottages have been established but there are several initiatives in the offing
the most advanced is a plan for five in the north of scotland which will be funded by the highlands and islands development board and british telecom
colin pavey of british telecom hopes that they will be running by the end of the year
two would be and three would be and located in schools
we are most interested in the idea of networking sharing skills such as translation and using them for distance learning
telephone cables in the region are being upgraded to ensure they are capable of handling faxes
mr dobbs more unlikely allies are the women institutes
most of the workers in telecottages and many of the users are women
he says in villages there are many women with skills who are using them because of problems
but they are interested in working
users of telecottages are given the key and people can use them at any time which means that women can come in during the evening early in the morning or whatever
he is working on a scheme with the national federation of wi to organise a competition to celebrate next year anniversary by offering telecottages as prizes for its branches and he is hoping the wi will establish a pilot telecottage near its college in denman oxfordshire
while telecottages should become once established they do need initial subsidy
the cost of providing the equipment is in the order of and mr dobbs thinks space is not much of a problem there usually the village hall or an empty shop
henning albrechsten reckons that it takes three years for a telecottage to be able to function without subsidy
in scandinavia with their mixed economies money is always available after a bit of persuasion from both local and central government
in britain the tight financial regime imposed on local councils and the reluctance of central government to take on any new expenditure makes it necessary to seek funds from the private sector
the only government support so far has been a recommendation by the rural development commission part of the department of the environment to establish a pilot scheme
mr dobbs sighs this is a typically british bureaucratic response
it been proved elsewhere that they work
we do need pilots we need telecottages
as for the private sector while bt may be happy to provide pump priming for five telecottages in the north of scotland it is not about to bankroll a nationwide network
nor it seems is anyone else
there is more at stake here than just bringing boxes of sophisticated equipment to remote areas
as mr dobbs who runs a country house restoration business from his home in micheldever hampshire says villages are good places to live and work
the village is a fantastic institution and they make people happier
but the villages are dying becoming suburbs or dormitories where few people work but many sleep
employment in agriculture still the main rural industry fell from over a million in the to under now
the aim of telecottages is to create flexible employment which will provide new jobs and make existing rural industries more competitive
the emphasis on high wages is important
villages are expensive to live in and if they are to become vibrant communities again local people must be able to earn enough to be able to continue living in them
there is a wider impact too
the abstract talk of commuting by rail or road being replaced by information technology finds a concrete expression in the idea of telecottages
once people overcome their fears about computers and begin to use them in telecottages they acquire their own equipment
many may eventually be able to work from home rather than commute to an office
henning albrechsten says modern information technology has given people in remote regions the opportunity to overcome their worst handicap their distance from the centres of learning and development
he sees them as not only strengthening small communities but also as actually beginning to reverse the population flows from the countryside to the towns
britain with its growing traffic problems seems an ideal place for the onset of this revolution
despite mr dobbs tireless efforts this is another revolution which britain is likely to be viewing from the sidelines
rugby union welsh horizon all turns black
by steve bale
each new indignity in the heap visited on welsh rugby seems worse than the last
the selectors knew they were playing with fire when they decided to arrange a couple of club fixtures and they have duly been consumed in a conflagration of their own making
the new zealanders appropriately garbed in funereal black arrive next week to scatter the ashes
on and off the field the national game of the land of song is in a discordant mess
losing was one thing but to lose as spinelessly as the welsh xv did to bridgend on saturday was to add insult to severely injured pride
in all honesty we should have won by at least points brian nicholas the bridgend coach said
as if and derisive chants of easy easy were not bad enough this humiliation was against a side who have made a wretched start to the season a week earlier pontypool had given them a and were short of at least players
four of the absentees suffered the squirming discomfort of being among the welsh squad
it not that i do want to say anything but i just do know what to say john ryan the welsh coach sighed
his plans in ruins he is now reduced to hoping something will turn up before his players face the all blacks in five short weeks
at bridgend he looked in despair and he almost admitted as much i hope we can pull it together but sometimes i have my doubts
nicholas was sympathetic he is only as good as the players we give him
but another selector confided the truth that wales should be giving club opposition a hammering and at building on their win over newbridge it looked as if they would
they had weathered bridgend early fury conceding a try before coming back with some confidence to score three of their own
but wales were having us on
from the comparative opulence of they then slipped into penury by conceding unanswered points
bridgend raised their game against wales now wales must do precisely the same against new zealand
no one who was at the brewery field perhaps not even the selectors would give twopence for their ability to do so
the backs were mainly pedestrian but the fundamental problem lay elsewhere
apart from kevin moseley steady supply from the there was nothing much to commend in a welsh forward effort which reverted to the very worst eighties stereotype of static cumbersome donkeys only too willing to slow the game to walking pace
when the pressure comes on players revert to bad habits ryan said
the all blacks would treat such an outmoded approach with the scorn it deserves although on the other hand they might have been impressed with bridgend contrasting mobility and aggression
the back row were swifter to the loose ball had a clearer idea of what to do with it when they got there and their impressive were given every opportunity which they eagerly took to control the game
this was conveniently encapsulated in the first try
wales characteristically delayed the heel at a scrum putting robert jones in trouble when the ball finally emerged
he was scragged by mike budd jeremy cooper came away with the ball owain williams acted as the link and kevin ellis scored three forwards and their in perfect harmony
wales instant reaction a try by arthur emyr and subsequent steady improvement bringing tries for emyr and robert jones promised more than was later fulfilled
in the third quarter bridgend had little difficulty in wiping out an deficit huw bevan supporting aled williams break for their second try
it was a magnificent fightback and such was welsh distress that they never looked like preventing it
we have taken a step backward ryan said and on this sorry evidence it looks as if it will be backwards all the way when the test takes place at cardiff arms park on november
as the welsh squad do not meet again until october time has all but run out
football hazard hints at the missing gifts
by patrick barclay
how to describe saturday match between chelsea and arsenal
well i seem to recall a london gallery exhibiting a pile of rubbish which was considered valid art by the proprietors and drew a large attendance
the only redeeming feature of a goalless worthless event at stamford bridge was that it did not require a grant
yet the chelsea manager bobby campbell and arsenal assistant theo foley agreed it had been a good match and the spectators complaints were muted
some even applauded the players at the end
it takes all sorts
bobby robson was there to assess world cup candidates but nothing positive emerged from minutes of scuffling that made one almost yearn for the more measured boredom of rangers european cup exit in munich three days earlier
at least the outcome was appropriate
had either of the teams won they would have taken the league leadership
instead liverpool stayed top without kicking a ball
television had postponed manchester united scheduled visit to anfield so it could be shown live on december the longest night
london leading pair as if piqued by this turned september into the longest afternoon
on and on it dragged
lacking a goal that might have altered its chemistry it remained a matter of dull physics
yet many of the crowd were kept interested by the possibility of victory which is i suppose what derbies are about
they are so frequent these days in london which has eight of first division clubs that we must expect aesthetic considerations to be overridden
why though could these supposed championship contenders not have tried to emulate the fine passing that had sprinkled the previous weekend merseyside joust
the simple answer is that chelsea are in a false position and arsenal on this evidence slightly jaded champions
they ought to have pocketed three points in the first but tony adams a more threatening on his forays than the current alan smith missed the target with two headers and david rocastle let dave beasant save a penalty much as the keeper had done for wimbledon in the fa cup final
now an arsenal team in peak health would have kept a grip on the match
this one could not
as george graham indicated upon his side accession to the title they would need more composure and sophistication to match liverpool in the longer term
he chose not to hasten the process by buying
after all he had just the man on his staff
but paul davis remains unfit
his absence is increasingly conspicuous and liverpool for the moment in a super league of one
davis of course would have walked into england team in poland a week on wednesday until last season prolonged suspension followed by injury bobby robson had him firmly pencilled in as bryan robson replacement
michael thomas several years younger is not quite in the same class yet but may have to play in chorzow
if so it will be a gamble because he flopped on his only previous international appearance in saudi arabia
the odds are favourable enough according to chelsea mike hazard who said of his adversary he could cope in poland not just because of his ability to close people down and use the ball well but temperament you saw when he scored the goal that won arsenal the league
very kind but international players are supposed to be habitually influential and it was hazard who in the second half with a few incisive passes gifts from the heavens on a day like this left a greater mark
chelsea might have won had the ball not kept turning into a mexican bean at kerry dixon feet
campbell side are still trying to sort out their system which involves a spare defender and as far as one can see a good deal of improvisation
it should suit tony dorigo the unblooded england though oddly his rival nigel winterburn did more rampaging on saturday neither in truth made the heart pound
dorigo at least had the satisfaction of seeing his direct opponent and england colleague david rocastle withdrawn
all in all bobby robson must have found it about as fruitful as a day trying to get in touch with brian clough
there was however one aspect that deserves commendation
after minutes graham roberts was injured by a tackle for which perry groves was booked steve clarke took over as sweeper and is likely to have several weeks in which to build on a promising display
roberts ankle appeared broken but the chelsea players were not interested in retribution and the club as soon as they knew the injury was less serious put a message on the electronic scoreboard an example of public relations from which others could learn
pope rejects runcie vision of church leadership
from andrew brown religious affairs correspondent in rome
the archbishop of canterbury dr robert runcie exchanged a symbolic kiss of peace with pope john paul ii yesterday at a mass attended by thousands in st peter square rome
but dr runcie ideas of a limited primacy recognising the pope as a central figure in the christian church who would exercise a primacy for the sake of unity and mission have been rejected as insufficient by the pope
they have also aroused protestant anger against dr runcie at the same time as he has become involved in a row over his attack on the pharisees of british society
though dr runcie and his party could not take holy communion at the papal mass he had earlier celebrated the eucharist at the anglican church in rome after three demonstrators rose from the congregation as he ascended the pulpit the visit has been dogged by protests from supporters of the rev ian paisley
in his sermon dr runcie said we should ever recognise the scandal that anglicans and roman catholics must celebrate two eucharists to make one memorial of our redemption on the day of our lord
dr runcie has gone out of his way on this visit to concede many of the doctrinal points and practices which large elements of the church of england have traditionally found offensive in roman catholicism
the pope too has spoken warmly of unity
on saturday the two prelates attended a service of vespers at the church of san gregorio which stands on the site where pope gregory sent st augustine of canterbury off to become the first archbishop of canterbury in
but in their prepared homilies the pope and the archbishop addressed quite different problems
dr runcie repeated his offer of a limited primacy involving the limited powers exercised by the popes in the first few centuries of the christian church
however the pope account of the role of the papacy went a great deal farther than that christian unity he said must be founded on the faith in christ that was handed on by the apostles what this faith is must be determined by the roman catholic church
he quoted the second vatican council the task of giving an authentic interpretation of the word of god has been entrusted to the living teachting office of the church alone
the specific role of bishops which is to be exercised in communion with the see of peter in ensuring the unity and continuity of the faith is vital if we are to hand on the faith of peter gregory and augustine
all our efforts to restore unity among christians will be in vain if they are not carried out in total fidelity to the faith in christ handed on by the apostles
in a statement afterwards dr runcie stressed that he was not proposing any change in the british constitution
the phrase universal primacy has a spiritual meaning
it does not imply political supremacy and does not suggest that the pope should administer the affairs of the church of england he said
both prelates referred to the consecration in february of the rt rev barbara harris as the anglican assistant bishop of massachussetts
bishop harris is quite unacceptable to the vatican
the pope said events in recent years have seriously aggravated the differences between us
the independent has learnt that american roman catholic nuns wrote last winter to dr runcie urging him to defy the pope over the ordination of women
sister margaret traxler of the national coalition of american nuns said that she had told dr runcie the roman catholic church says this is a deterrent to unity but we say how can this be a deterrent to unity when discrimination against women is evil
she said she had received a friendly and brotherly reply from dr runcie
labour would keep tight rein on spending
by anthony bevins political editor
john smith the shadow chancellor yesterday set the overriding tone for this week labour party conference with a warning that he would impose tough spending controls if labour won the next election
his warning casts doubt on labour commitment to increase spending on priority programmes for the health service and pensions
mr smith said in an interview on bbc television on the record that he did not expect his colleagues to spend and spend again when they took office
he conceded that there would be disputes with colleagues but said there are no quick fixes and i will not be indulging in any quick fix
a quick fix clearly becomes unfixed
there are realities that i can not change
there will be the reality of the economic situation which we inherit which will not be our fault but it will be our responsibility
now if that means we have to postpone some of our social ambitions then we may have to do so
but it will not mean that we are abandoning them
we will tackle putting our economy in order so that we can achieve that social ambition so that the strong economy is used to finance and develop the fair society
as for his colleagues mr smith said we all agreed that we can not spend what we have not earned and we intend to earn it before we spend it
that will be the guiding light of the next labour government
when i insist on that priority as i can tell you i most certainly will with the full support of the prime minister in doing so then i sure my colleagues will see the point of that
now it is quite right of them of course to allow our social obligations not to be forgotten there probably be an argument
there are in all governments between the treasury and spending ministers
but they will take into account the need for that balance that says that social spending without underpinning by economic growth will not be sustained in any event
mr smith warning coincided with a call by ken livingstone the labour mp for brent east who said on london weekend television the walden interview you can be miles ahead in the polls but when you get to the last three weeks people think can i afford a labour government
we need to say now what we are going to spend where the money is going to come from
mr livingstone called for cuts in defence spending
david blunkett another member of the national executive told a conference fringe rally organised by the labour coordinating committee that labour would have to find additional funds for its social programme by cutting from defence spending over five years and raising the level of taxation on the rich
the policy review top rate of income tax per cent was too low he said
although the policy review will be endorsed by the conference giving neil kinnock the freedom to go on to the offensive against the conservatives in the to the next general election there are a number of areas of potential conflict
calls for consideration of electoral reform and a new form of black representation are both expected to be defeated
ron todd the general secretary of the transport workers union said that today vote on the multilaterist nuclear defence policy would not yield the massive and overwhelming majority predicted by and he warned that party leaders could not expect everybody to in the same direction once the policy had been carried
the conference opened with labour buoyed by a series of weekend opinion polls giving leads of from to points
health update crack connection with aids
by olivia timbs
there is much concern in the us about the addiction to crack purified cocaine within communities
doctors are worried that women turning to prostitution to finance the habit are at risk of contracting aids
this problem has spread to the uk
in the past two months doctors at the regional addiction treatment unit in birmingham have come across five patients addicted to crack
three are prostitutes introduced to the drug by pimps
according to them crack is widely available in birmingham and most prostitutes they know use it daily
the doctors point out in the british medical journal that though crack dependency is not a direct risk factor for aids prostitutes trying to maintain expensive crack habits may be tempted into unsafe sex practices which in turn may lead to an increase in the spread of aids
health update zinc deficiency in pregnancy
by olivia timbs
fads for vitamin supplements have been overtaken by a vogue for minerals and trace elements
zinc is the latest lack of it supposedly causes a range of problems although little scientific evidence supports the link
but some reports have suggested that low zinc levels may lead to problems in pregnancy from difficult labour to congenital malformations in children
there is stronger evidence that a zinc deficiency may cause the foetus to grow slowly in the womb
doctors in bristol decided to test the theory
in a study of nearly women they found that zinc supplements did not improve either foetal health or reduce the number of labours
the doctors conclude in the british medical journal that there would be little benefit if all women in the uk were given zinc supplements during pregnancy
they recognise however that the women in their study were largely who might well have sufficiently large zinc stores because they were well nourished
further studies the researchers believe should concentrate on pregnant women known to have a zinc deficiency or to be at risk from problems during labour
health alternative cures not proven
by olivia timbs
renee henry underwent a lumpectomy and radiotherapy for her breast cancer
dr maurice slevin a consultant physician at the department of medical oncology at st bartholomew hospital london said the chances of a woman being alive and well four years after such treatment were at least per cent
mrs henry refused the drug treatment given to reduce the chances of a relapse but there are many who would remain well without it dr slevin said
part of the attraction of alternative cancer treatments such as the gerson therapy is that they allow a patient to feel more in control of the treatment
dr slevin agreed that this is often beneficial but is concerned about other aspects of such therapies
very few have been evaluated and the evidence is largely anecdotal he said
some of the treatments have dramatic
if they do work that is wonderful but we have no way of knowing for sure
there have been no controlled trials of the gerson therapy
if one of my patients wants to give up a potentially curative treatment in favour of an alternative therapy then i will try to dissuade them
but it is essentially upto the patient
he said the nhs should address itself more to the needs of cancer patients so that they do not feel they have to go outside the system
they should be offered relaxation therapy and stress management and advice on diet and exercise he said
the imperial cancer research fund and the cancer research campaign are conducting a joint study of the bristol cancer help centre which offers a holistic programme dietary advice and emotional counselling to complement medical treatment
media return of the saga modern actors can not ride and young viewers do not understand the cowboy code but a revival of the western looms on the horizon john lichfield says
by john lichfield
where are the tv westerns of yesteryear
what happened to ben cartwright hoss and little joe
where is the wagon train that seemed permanently to be circling its wagons waiting for a drunken pioneer wife to have twins in the last of them
the tv western seemed to fade into the sunset some time in the victim of a narcissistic age that preferred to look at prosperous or violent images of itself dallas cheers miami vice
it was a time when children were encouraged to fantasize about machines and outer space rather than marvel at the open spaces where the deer and buffalo roamed
now however it seems the wheel has turned full circle
the western is being revived reinterpreted for the
one of the most successful hollywood tv producers david jacobs the creator of dallas believes the western also fell victim to late iconoclasm
the john wayne stereotype was rejected along with his conservative values he said
a series of spoof or obsessively realistic westerns cat balou butch cassidy and the sundance kid soldier blue the wild bunch stripped the mask from the lone ranger face
the legend could not be taken seriously any longer in what had been admittedly a threadbare form
howard rosenberg tv critic of the los angeles times said just look at the of the old western series
you had heroes to their horses and lightly sprinkled with dust
you ca get away with that any more
john mantley producer of gunsmoke for cbs for years says elements of the old story began to fall apart
we all read bury my heart at wounded knee
we knew that the us government had signed treaties with the indians and broken every one
a part of the myth just did work after that
at their peak in the there were western series on the three american tv networks almost two a day on each channel
in the us weekly audience ratings in there were three westerns in the top five and seven in the top
by the they had all gone the way of the buffalo extinct save for preservation in the national park of permanent
gene autry the first tv cowboy now says westerns dominated the early days of tv partly because they had lively cheaply produced visuals but mainly because early tv was starved of feature films by the studios
westerns were a handy substitute
there are encouraging signs however that the tv western is struggling back into the saddle
paradise launched on cbs last season and shown on this summer was the first new western serial for a decade
it was the only new drama series in us network tv to be allowed a second series this year despite a relatively lowly ranking in the ratings
its creator and executive producer is perhaps surprisingly david jacobs
why did he follow j r ewing the epitome of tv with a western about a gunfighter turned foster father
i believed the genre was still an important and powerful one
it something i always had an affection for
i found it was possible with paradise to talk about individual and personal responsibility something which if set in a contemporary context would have had a preachy feel about it
lonesome dove a story of a cattle drive also shown on cbs last year was the tv of any kind in america for five years
it won substantial critical acclaim and will show in britain next year
the season which started this month brought another new western series abc young riders which tells the story of the pony express
it also says a lot about modern american tv
because the networks believe westerns appeal mainly to men young riders has a cast of five pouting young male actors in an attempt to make a western with good demographics
the effect is rather like an extended advertisement for marlboro lights
westerns are no longer a cheap option
the classic western tv series were filmed in or in the miles from los angeles
modern audiences no longer accept plastic bushes and the southern californian suburban sprawl means the production companies have to take their horses and cows to locations far away in arizona or montana
david jacobs also points out that the cost of hiring a is now prohibitive
at one time there were dozens of companies which specialised in renting out western paraphernalia
now there are maybe two
the cost has gone through the barn roof
and actors can no longer ride
they have to be sent to cowboy school
westerns by their nature demand more time on location
as a result mr jacobs says it cost nearly as much to make an episode of paradise with relatively unknown actors as an episode of dallas with its big stars
will the western ride again
john mantley is cautious
westerns have a gladiatorial timeless quality
on the other hand you have a whole generation of tv watchers that does really know the rules
a western is like a japanese noh play
it is a stylised drama with understated dialogue that depends on recognition of key words and concepts
many of the young people today have the first idea of what going on
in the inert the western represented a troubled adventurous american past
in the anxious and eventful late and they may come to represent like all creatures great and small in britain a less confusing past with simpler deeper values
maybe
on the other hand the young riders came in the ratings in its first week trailing far far behind all the modern myths about modern times such as the cosby show roseanne golden girls cheers and matlock
it is premature then to say that the western has galloped back to centre screen
but there is a puff of dust on the horizon
motoring a lover guide to used cars drivers with a tight budget and an environmental conscience can buy without losing principles says james ruppert
by james ruppert
from this month all new cars submitted for british type approval the test which allows them to be legally sold in the uk must be able to run on petrol
as a result of this rule and many carefully orchestrated publicity campaigns the motor industry image has now changed from polluter to pal of the earth
if you can afford an environmentally friendly runabout then the flora fauna and children of the british isles will have a lot to thank you for
but if you have a tight budget and a conscience running older cars on fuel becomes a much more complicated issue
without the presence of a lead compound an engine valve seats go unprotected
this leads to premature wear and plumes of blue smoke spewing from the exhaust
the only effective remedy is to install hardened valve seats or a replacement cylinder head both expensive options
less costly but not entirely satisfactory is the practice of making every fourth tankful leaded petrol which protects the valve seats but rather defeats the object
alternatively there are several chemical additives on the market which aim to provide a substitute for lead although the case for these products has yet to be proved
however many cars built within the last few years have hardened valve seats or alloy cylinder heads that need little simply a retune or no modification to use unleaded petrol
finding out which cars can and which can not is not difficult
esso filling stations have a free booklet listing most models produced since as does the charity clear with more detail available in the unleaded petrol guide autodale
looking at those lists provides interesting reading and bears out the trade view that having a car could prove to be a liability
it is not as if leaded fuel is going to be phased out tomorrow but more and more buyers are asking does it take unleaded
what is certain is that the range all skodas yugos and quite a few lancias do not which does not help already depressed resale prices
a lancia lead only sells for around whereas the similar fiat uno from the same year converted to run on unleaded is worth around more
a car is now worth about per cent less than an unleaded equivalent
in years to come the percentage difference is likely to be much larger
even so exotica such as porsche and ferraris are unlikely to be part of this trend so no bargains there i afraid
more impressive are the japanese manufacturers whose cars dating from the early eighties can run on unleaded without adjustment
find a toyota corolla or nissan sunny that has not succumbed to rust and you can buy with confidence
on the home front most fords and vauxhalls from at least the can use unleaded
if the greenness of going unleaded still seems a bit of a grey area it is possible to switch to diesel without a shadow of environmental doubt
diesel always has been and the only adjustments you need to make are mental ones because cars are no longer slow smelly or noisy
they also return more miles to the gallon than their petrol equivalents although service intervals are shorter
but after the publicity on unleaded fuel there has been increased interest in used diesel power
but remember that these cars accrue and can withstand significantly higher mileages than petrol cars being the norm
the tradition for diesel cars is far better established on the continent and that is where the best buys come from
perhaps the most successful maker is peugeot with a complete range of cars from the small around for a car to the legendary estate about for a example
the germans are also fairly accomplished manufacturers although a golf with a mileage will still cost
prestige comes in the shape of a mercedes with the or stuttgart taxi commanding but returning unfailing reliability
even if lead levels in the atmosphere do not bother you i am sure you will find the fact that unleaded petrol is cheaper and that diesel fuel boosts mpg by at least a third most interesting

i know that today is saturday because already i am thirsty for a dry hoppy pint of bitter at the end of the afternoon an aperitif to sharpen my appetite for this evening indian meal
how did you feel as you came to the end of your working week yesterday afternoon
boy i had a thirst
we say we are thirsty when we mean that we fancy a glass of wine a pint of beer a gin and tonic or a shot of whisky the pleasure of naming our poison at the end of a busy day or tiresome week
that is not thirst
to enjoy it we do not need to be dry just in need of a restorative or relaxant or maybe a focus for a social moment or brief encounter
we call it thirst in lieu of a more accurate description
no not more accurate thirst is not accurate at all as a description for this apparently indescribable condition
it is a desire millions of us know and share yet for which we have no name
this desire that can not find its name though it would dare speak it if it could is pleasurable
it is as enjoyable as feeling gently hungry or amorous
no not amorous randy we have a word for that
any of these conditions is pleasurable so long as there is a good likelihood of satisfaction in reasonably short order
let puritans and pessimists damn disapprove or dismiss these appetites that is their loss
those of us who enjoy them need only a name for each condition so that we may discuss them in expectation and in recollection
come to think of it neither hunger nor randiness hits quite the spot
peckishness and lust perhaps
or does that sound like a firm of country solicitors
this is to digress
what of this thirst that can be satisfied by an unquenching drink
wine is not quenching but no less in demand for that
try to quench your thirst with a light fresh white and you will drink enough to put you on your back
beer is quite rightly britain favourite friday night drink
it can momentarily blunt a thirst but not altogether cut it
the nearest to being quenching is the white beer of berlin
anything with even a modest smack of hops dries the palate ready for the next one
so of course does alcohol itself
it may for a moment seem to quench but it dehydrates as purportedly healthy abstainers are forever telling me
to quench is more than to refresh although our lying lascivious eyes tell us the two are the same
does any drink look more quenching than one of those italian or french patent aperitifs swirling in a refractive pink or russet oiliness clothing the melting ice a campari dubonnet lillet or too rare in this country a picon
are they quenching
no refreshing
in strasburg they have been known to lace beer with picon thereby ruining both drinks as queen victoria reputedly did with claret and malt whisky but still the result is not especially quenching
perhaps a shimmering dry martini cocktail minimum dilution stirred not shaken and served straight up looks even more refreshing though its effect is that of a silver mallet
in the right place possibly new york but san francisco is better the martini is the ultimate thank god it friday drink
the requirement for such pleasures is a matter of time and place and it does not have to be friday berlin or strasburg new york or san francisco
not feeling thirsty but fancying a drink has a world of moments
some frenchmen start the day with a coffee and calvados
the people of munich call their version of weissbier breakfast beer and have it with a pair of coddled veal sausages
new orleans favours a milk punch or its own variation on the gin fizz
if the moment is before a lunch on the plane it really ought to be a bloody mary
if it is at an elegant dinner table there is a choice between a fino sherry or a manzanilla or champagne
none of these requires anything even approaching a thirst
do we really wash down a good meal with claret
port is immediately suggested by stilton cognac by coffee
i do not fully appreciate the experience of an american movie without a bourbon or a book at bedtime without a single malt
these are not moments of thirst but nor are they causes of drunkenness unless one tries to pack all such experiences into one day
we do not drink because we are thirsty
nor if we are in civilised cast of mind because we wish to become drunk
a friend of mine says that her body tells her without being asked the season of the year
at the end of summer her body stops wanting gin and tonics and suddenly desires whisky
if it were only a matter of alcohol would a body care
people will nevertheless say that the desire is for nothing more than alcohol
so why not a pill or an injection
because there would be no colour no ritual no time and place no glorious variety
worst of all there would be no aroma taste texture or finish
these are sensuous pleasures at their most enjoyable when we ritualise them but how do we feel when we desire them
we who have so many words in our language have none for this
but then do the french spanish or italians have a word for it
perhaps they do maybe i have not being paying attention too busy with the anis or grappa
do the greeks have a word for it
could we borrow beg or invent one
answers in a bottle please
if you are feeling for lack of a better word let meet again next month
same time same place
it will be my turn to get them in i think
in the garden planning to beat a leafy retreat at home in the first of a series for novice gardeners anna pavord stresses the value of careful forethought
by anna pavord
plants should come a long way down the list of priorities for the novice gardener
there are many things to think about before even the first tentative daffodil bulb is sunk into the ground
the first and most important question to mull over as you gaze at your patch is what is this garden for
if you start writing down some of the responses to that question you will find you have along the way acquired a ragbag of elements that will have an important bearing on the design
if there are small children in the equation there will need to be a flat soft area where they can fall off swings and climbing frames
if you like hanging out washing rather than drying it in the bowels of an expensive machine you will need to tuck away a line and make a dry path to get to and from it
some novice gardeners may not want to do much actual gardening at all but conversely do not want to look out every day over a scene of threadbare grass and rotting fence
their ideal garden will look good and demand little attention
if you are a dedicated you need to mark out the part of the garden where the sun lingers longest
it may not be the part nearest the house though this is where sitting out areas always tend to be made
you may even as a novice care so passionately about plants that all you want is the maximum space to grow them in
raised beds built down an unpromising alley could provide extra gardening space
privacy is an important consideration
a first time garden is usually small and certainly the typical one i am imagining for this series is no more than x and surrounded on all sides by other houses
privacy is a ticklish business where close neighbours are concerned
to throw up an impenetrable berlin wall between you and them could be tactless
trellis is a useful compromise and you can always pretend it was forced on you by the speed of growth of your climbing rose
aesthetes among the novices will by now be thoroughly irritable and complaining that gardens should have as much to do with the soul as with the necessity or not of a washing line or a barbecue pit
so they should and when the list of necessities is securely written down you can ask the second question how do i want this garden to feel
this question produces as varied a response as the first
some urban gardeners as short of space inside as they are out want their gardens to be extensions of their homes with a great deal of hard paving good furniture and lighting
the garden for them should feel like an extra sitting room perhaps damp occasionally but an important overflow of living space
closet countrysiders may want to pretend their patch is actually a corner of some sussex meadow and picture it swagged with honeysuckle and waving with daisies and scabious
this is a difficult trick to bring off with suburban trains hurtling by on one side and lorries grinding through their gears on the other
a leafy retreat is an excellent goal for a small town garden but it is best made acknowledging the urban setting using plants such as bamboo acanthus fig vine alchemilla euphorbia wisteria
while you are working through this process take note of the features in the garden that you would like to keep
on a new estate there may be nothing
in an old garden there may be a fruit tree or a good bulwark of evergreen laurel or box that tidied up could add a dash of venerability to the new garden that will emerge around it
if you do not know what a tree or shrub is exercise clemency and give it a year grace to demonstrate its worth before you turn it over to the axeman
the mood of the garden will dictate its eventual style
it may be clipped classical random cottage modern or some intensely personal vision of byzantium that no one has ever imagined before but which exists in your head and wants to get out
do not let anybody particularly gardening writers tread on your dreams
all this thinking and doodling will have done nothing physically to change the view outside the window but it is a vital part of the gardening process
before you can make you have to know what it is you are making
property houses that are going going gone fed up with trying to sell more people are auctioning their home instead
andrew bibby reports
by andrew bibby
in the small devon town of south molton julie widlake is waiting with anticipation for friday october
she and her boyfriend have had their future planned for some time they want to start farming in a nearby village where they also intend to build a bungalow
first they have to sell their present house a cottage in the centre of the town
as is the case almost everywhere else the market in devon is depressed and selling has not been easy
so instead of waiting indefinitely for a buyer they have decided to try selling their house by auction
it comes under the hammer at on the at the barnstaple motel
we accept that we might not get very much for it but on the other hand we could get more says julie widlake
we been waiting to move for a long time and we need the money to build the new house
their south molton cottage guide price is one of more than lots to be put up for sale at the barnstaple auction by bristol and west property services and one of more than a hundred which the building society subsidiary will be auctioning in eight west country venues over a period
bristol and west claims these auctions will help to bring some action to an otherwise slow market and says it was overwhelmed by the response from people wanting to sell in this way
auctions certainly speed up the process
once the hammer has fallen the successful bidder for a house must exchange contracts immediately and pay a deposit
completion normally takes place four to eight weeks later and there is no opportunity for second thoughts
as the bristol and west explains if a bidder does not sign the contract the auctioneer can sign on their behalf
from the vendor point of view the house is actually sold once a successful bid is made says graham harrison director of bristol and west property services
many people have suffered from sales falling through and from chains and some of our vendors feel that now as good a time as any to sell
from the purchasers point of view auctions can also be attractive if slightly as you wait for bidding to start for the house of your dreams
the problem is that normally potential purchasers have to incur the expense of undertaking surveys and arranging mortgage finance without any idea whether they will be able to afford the final selling price
not surprisingly several estate agents report difficulties at the moment in attracting enough serious bidders
with an auction you got to be certain that at least two buyers are there who can commit themselves and the difficulty is that buyers who can proceed are few and far between said david phillip a director of yorkshire estate agents dacre son and hartley
bristol and west hopes that by arranging collective auctions it will be able to overcome this problem
it is also guaranteeing mortgages at per cent below the normal interest rate for endowment or policies on several of the houses up for sale an interesting and innovative service for bidders mortgage surveys will already have been undertaken for these houses
the building society will be staffing a mortgage desk at each auction and says buyers could arrange finance there and then subject of course to proof of income and status
obviously however bristol and west hopes to hear from interested people in advance if only so it can gauge the likely demand for each property before the auction starts
we trying to smooth the path for purchasers and streamline the system says graham harrison pointing out that live telephone bidding will also be available for those unable to attend
holiday homes and commercial property have been included among the lots to be auctioned
although collective property auctions take place regularly in london often primarily for investors rather than in country areas the more typical auction will be just for one house and as likely as not will take place in a nearby pub or village hall
in fact country auctions are often the nearest many villages get to live theatre
the locals come for the entertainment and to see who buying into their village observed one
pub landlords are usually only too happy to provide free accommodation
it very exciting and gets the adrenalin going says david phillip whose firm usually undertakes auctions in the otley area
only certain types of property normally come to auction however
traditionally country cottages and houses which have unusual or unique features or are in need of a lot of renovation may be auctioned if only because valuation is likely to be difficult
sometimes too houses have to be sold by auction to satisfy the legal requirements of trustees or executors auctions provide adequate proof that the property has been sold at the going market value and protect trustees from future claims of negligence
less happily but for the same reason repossessed houses are often auctioned
anyone considering selling by auction needs to be aware that the costs involved will be higher
advertising costs and any expenses incurred in hiring premises are normally passed on by the estate agents to the vendor whether or not the auction results in a sale
in addition agents may charge slightly more commission than usual for a successful sale
in bristol and west forthcoming auctions a set fee of plus vat will be charged to everyone entering property to sell with its usual agent commission about per cent plus vat charged on top when sales are made
we accept that we could lose the money we paid to go to auction but that a risk we prepared to take says julie widlake
the secret of a successful outcome depends partly on setting the right reserve price a task the auctioneer undertakes in conjunction with the seller
normally the reserve is set only days or hours before the auction when the agents will already have a good indication of how much interest has been shown
too high a reserve price can mean no sale and disappointment all round
you need to understand what your clients expectations are beforehand says graham harrison of bristol and west
agents and their clients may also have the dilemma of deciding whether to accept any offers made prior to the auction
inevitably they do not always get it right
peter crowther managing director of a leeds business centre recently bought two stone cottages in bramhope on the outskirts of leeds at an auction in the village pub
his successful bid was for although he had made a higher prior offer which had been turned down
on the other hand sometimes the drama of the auction and the competition between bidders can have the opposite effect
another recent auction in leeds saw a stone farmhouse without water or other amenities finally fall under the hammer for
success is by no means guaranteed at auction says graham harrison
in a tough market you need to get the programme right the price right and have a little bit of luck
bristol and west property services has produced a brochure covering all eight west country auctions
the churches built on wool angela lambert enjoys the riches at the heart of east anglia
by angela lambert
until six or seven years ago outsiders associated east anglia with fens flatness and the vanished edwardian nannies of frinton
its old churches green fields and long beaches were cherished by the inhabitants of essex suffolk norfolk and cambridgeshire but not yet on the tourist agenda
today i was told villagers living around the great wool churches of lavenham and long melford have to bar their doors and ignore the knocking of tourists who take them for antique shops and offer to buy their furniture
the tourists are right
east anglia on a sunny weekend is a place of matchless beauty
its villages look too good to be true
lavenham and long melford for example have no telegraph poles to preserve the timeless air that pervades them
yet you only have to read ronald blythe akenfield to realise that these picturesque cottages often painted the characteristic essex pink pale salmon ochre or green are more prosperous now than ever in the real past
many are still elaborately decorated with pargeting an ornate patterned plasterwork practised in this area since the early thirteenth century
most of east anglia prosperity today is due to city commuters the market and tourism
the ideal hotel from which to explore is dedham hall set among tall trees in the vale of dedham looking directly across towards dedham church on one side and flatford mill on the other both painted by constable
the hotel lies in five acres of fields and garden and the slingos who own it make the most of their beautiful surroundings by running painting courses for about a week including breakfast and dinner or for a long weekend
these are so popular that you will need to book at least a couple of months in advance
the other great joy of dedham hall is the food
the slingos have their own vegetable garden chickens ducks sheep and cows
everything is and fresh it tastes like forgotten food
if dedham hall is fully booked and it may well be try the best we have ever found just a few miles away at the old vicarage higham near colchester
it is a rambling tudor house run by john and margaret parker whose breakfast room and drawing room look out over a wonderful walled garden beyond which fields of grazing cows stretch down to the river
another hotel that would make a good starting point for a weekend or longer in east anglia is the black lion at long melford
it changed hands recently and is now run by stephen and janet errington
after dinner there when the moon was full and low and deep orange we walked up the road from the hotel to long melford church
its vast walls of flint and glass and gothic tracery were brilliantly floodlit and the churchyard cat sleek and black as tar greeted us querulously and led us right round the church and through the gravestones at the back glimmering and pale in the moonlight
we were quite alone and the great church the size of a cathedral was unearthly in its floodlit moonlit beauty
long melford is one of the wool churches that commemorate the wealth of east anglia in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
another is at lavenham minutes drive up the road
just inside the front porch a handwritten book is prefaced with the words this book has been compiled that something more than their mere names may be known of the lavenham men who gave their lives for their country in the great war
this is followed by or so names each with a description
the book is deeply moving and sets the tone for a walk round this glorious building which has seen the christenings marriages and burials of the folk of the village for more than years
east anglia is exceptionally rich in churches and cathedrals
there are several splendid houses near long melford that would make for a gentle afternoon potter through the rooms and possessions of the rich of a few centuries ago
the loveliest to my mind is melford hall whose charming octagonal jacobean gatehouse is reached along an avenue of clipped yew trees and with its high windows flooding the octagon with light is my fantasy of the ideal study
lavenham is often called the finest medieval village in england
it is an image of the world we have lost its gently sloping streets converging upon the market place
here stand the early timbered guildhall now a museum to years of the cloth industry
next to it is the little hall dating from the fourteenth century with its floorboards gleaming with the patina of age ceilings and a tiny unruly charming walled garden
precisely next door to this is a restaurant called the great house
here in the cool pretty setting of the dining room that was once stephen spender you will be served an exquisite lunch for for children
the wine list is small but perfectly chosen
the service is impeccable
east anglia has bookshops filled with titles like things for a boy to do
constable landscapes
gainsborough house to say nothing of huge grey sweeps of empty beach from which at aldeburgh you can buy skate direct from the fishing boats as they come out of the water
it has colchester oysters
it has ely cathedral its great green windows casting a translucent light across the lady chapel
with all this small wonder it also has tourists
a prayer for the brick cathedral facing st paul bankside power station is a masterpiece worth preserving gavin stamp argues
by gavin stamp
from the top of the dome of st paul cathedral the view is no longer dominated by city church steeples but by an intrusive cacophony of drab characterless sixties boxes
one building stands out in this dispiriting panorama of mediocrity a dark powerful mass of brickwork with a tall central tower that stands right across the thames from wren dome
this is not an office block nor a church although its sublime form might suggest that its architect was adept at designing cathedrals
it is in fact the now redundant electric power station that sits on bankside next to the site of sam wanamaker new globe theatre
bankside power station should never have been built
its architect had spent the war years with fellow royal academicians planning the orderly and spacious london of the future free of smoke and industry
but when asked in to replace an old dirty power station that had been on the site since he soon forgot such idealism and like any architect was glad to have the job
the project was controversial and the power station was only permitted providing the smoke was clean and the building did not challenge the visual dominance of st paul
so the single chimney rose only to some below the height of the cross above the cathedral
the irony is that had the tower been higher and had the teak scrubbers been less efficient the smoke would have gone straight up into the air
as it was the smokeless shimmer of vapour was so cooled by cleaning that it drifted across the river to cause mischief with the leadwork on wren great dome
bankside power station should not have been built
but as it was built it should not now be demolished
that is because it is a magnificent structure the supreme architectural expression of the heroic monumental phase of power station design and the creation of a great architect
bankside was the work of sir giles gilbert scott om the architect of liverpool anglican cathedral the rebuilt house of commons and some of the last vital products of the gothic revival
he was a designer of extraordinary versatility being responsible for the standard traditional red telephone kiosk waterloo bridge and several power stations
bankside represents the fullest realisation of his industrial aesthetic
scott first venture into this unlikely field of design was at battersea where in he was wheeled in as a famous knighted architect by the london power company to try to make acceptable the monster power station to which the residents of chelsea and westminster were taking strong exception
this was a brilliant move
scott was so successful in styling the building in fine brickwork with fluting as john betjeman called it that when the battersea a station was opened in it was widely acclaimed as a supremely successful modern treatment of a building type that seemed quintessentially twentieth century
when in the architects journal conducted a survey to find what were considered the best modern buildings in britain battersea was placed second and was the favourite of such unlikely celebrities as sir kenneth clark rebecca west and charles laughton
scott was so pleased with the style he had evolved at battersea a treatment that humanised industrial forms without denying their function that he also used it on the guinness factory at park royal west london
at battersea scott could not alter the basic design of the building and he much disliked the upturned table appearance created by the four corner chimneys
at bankside however he was able to persuade the engineers mott hay anderson to gather all the flues into a single slender tower or campanile
as a result he was able to create a symmetrical monumental composition of great power
as at all his power stations scott faced the building in a fine worcestershire brick that has weathered to a lovely
but there is nothing homely about the general effect
vast overlapping planes of brickwork are modelled with careful and subtle bands of detail
the result is an expression of the monumental aesthetic of the early twentieth century with strong american overtones
when the campanile is seen from a distance it seems to belong to some strange expressionist church one has not noticed before
not for nothing were such power stations described as brick cathedrals bankside is the finest manifestation of this tradition
now it is redundant
smoke shimmers no longer from the tall tower
but bankside is nevertheless a sound structure which like the best mills of the industrial revolution is well worth preserving and is perfectly capable of adaptation for a new commercial use
such is of course much encouraged by a building being listed something which until recently was not possible with architecture of so recent a date
two years ago however the department of the environment at last began the listing of buildings in england that were more than years old
bracken house the former home of the financial times became the first candidate and english heritage then submitted some recommendations to the department of the environment these included bankside
this however was too much for the government and using the excuse that public opinion was not yet ready to accept the protection of many unpopular modern buildings lord caithness the minister of state for the environment arbitrarily whittled down english heritage list to buildings excluding bankside although it represented a more traditional approach in the fifties to the modern movement
however caithness himself stated that this first selection was in no way a definitive list
i have no doubt that others will be added
the important thing is that the thirty year rule is in force and that we can respond to developing perceptions of our times
earlier this year in my capacity as chairman of the thirties society i asked caithness successor virginia bottomley to reconsider english heritage recommendation of bankside for listing
my argument was that as michael heseltine had so boldly listed battersea power station in it was illogical not to protect a much finer and more complete industrial work by the same architect
furthermore the listing of battersea had ensured the building survival for conversion to a new use in that case as an entertainment centre which the prime minister herself had praised and inaugurated
after two months silence i was informed that ministers stood by their decision
i wrote back asking the reasons for this pointing out that if any large modern power station deserved to be listed it was bankside
i have received no satisfactory reply
of course i know perfectly well why the department of the environment declines to list it
listed building procedures might impede the full commercial realisation of the site when the electricity industry is privatised
furthermore british rail has its eyes on the bankside site for bringing up the spoil from the tunnel for channel traffic which it is so absurdly driving under the middle of london at astronomical cost
listing in theory is an objective assessment of architectural or historical importance which does not necessarily prevent demolition
in the case of bankside power station the ultimate temple of power and a masterpiece of industrial architecture by a major british architect our historic building system is being perverted for purely political reasons
her dress hangs here the kahlo cult
oriana baddeley
the have witnessed a shift in the art establishment attitudes towards art produced outside of its traditional parameters
the work of previously marginalised artists has become an area of rich speculation among art dealers priced out of the modern masters market
almost every year has witnessed the discovery of new artistic terrain graffiti art soviet art australian art the art of latin america
the major auction houses have moved with the times and have found new ways of selling works which in both form and content would have proved an unstable investment a decade ago
the current status of the work of the mexican painter frida kahlo is a dramatic example of this change
once known primarily as the wife of diego rivera her reputation outside of mexico now far supercedes his since sale room estimates of her work have risen from to over million and in a work by kahlo broke all records at sotheby new york for a latin american artist
the enormous rise in the economic value of her work has developed in tandem with the increased critical and popular response to her particular blend of naive style and incisive content
while the first wave of popular interest arose with the whitechapel exhibition instigated by laura mulvey and peter wollen it was the publication of hayden herrera biography of kahlo in which has led to her current cult status
since that date she has been the subject of tv documentaries a feature film frida by paul leduc a stage play numerous publications and the inspiration for designer clothing
in may elle magazine ran a page feature on frida kahlo as the spirit of mexico fig while in vogue there was a page interpretation of the romance of frida kahlo mexico fig
almost as a logical outcome of this media blitz it emerged in the summer of that madonna already a devotee of kahlo work was commissioning a screenplay based on kahlo life
fig
elle magazine may
as with most artists who have become mythical personalities in the popular imagination such attention has focused primarily on the anecdotal and tragic details of kahlo admittedly fascinating life
the passionate obsession with her husband diego rivera her flamboyant appearance but most of all her physical and emotional pain have come to dominate responses to her work
while kahlo art helped her to deal with the vicissitudes of her life for most audiences it is her life story which allows access to her art
in this one can draw obvious parallels to the appeal of van gogh a traditionally popular artist recently made fashionable by the media attention generated during the centennial of his death
the archetypal became an appropriate icon for the sixties revival of long hot summer
yet despite the iconic status of van gogh tragic life it is the appearance of his work by which he is ultimately signified his thick impasto his vibrant yellows the urgency of his creative drive
in the case of kahlo the popular image is of the artist herself the characteristic brows the elaborate hair the mexican costume fig
it is primarily her appearance not the formal language of her art that has graced the pages of elle and vogue magazines
the elle feature transposed the kahlo style to kahlo lookalikes in contemporary clothing balanced around segments of herrera biography of the artist
in the later vogue piece only the style remained as the far more overtly sexual kahloesque models lounged and pouted in their mexican interiors
there is a poignant irony in the way clothing which on one level served to hide kahlo broken body falls or is lifted by the model to reveal a luxuriantly perfect physique fig
the visual references in the two magazines are as much from photos of the artist as from her work
in both features she is also seen to embody a wider set of assumptions about mexico itself exotic passionate yet constantly struggling against pain and deceit
while elle vogue and subsequently the independent fig stressed different facets of kahlo public persona they all shared the emphasis on her as an encapsulisation of stereotypical images of mexico rather than her work
it is her body as the canvas her appearance as art
the art of becomes as art
fig
vogue february
fig
elle magazine may
of course the line between art and life is a particularly hard one to draw in kahlo case
the majority of her work is self portraiture her aesthetic concerns grew from her fascination with the falsity of appearance
dressing up role playing and masquerade form the conceptual basis of kahlo work
in with cropped hair fig she paints herself wearing rivera suit challenging traditional expectations of femininity and attempting to appropriate his authority while simultaneously threatening castration
more disturbingly in the mask fig she throws doubt on too straightforward a reading of her as revealing of her inner emotions
where does the mask fall does not the ritual repetition of those familiar features mask far more than it uncovers
there is however an inevitable logic to the appropriation of her meticulously constructed image a process which the artist was mocking as early as some of the gringa women are imitating me and trying to dress a la mexicana but the poor souls only look like cabbages and to tell you the naked truth they look absolutely impossible
the impossibility stemmed from the failure of such followers to recognise the symbolic importance of kahlo choice of clothing a failure also intrinsic to her recent magazine appearances
the particularities of mexico are frequently subsumed by the decorativeness of the ethnic by the generalised attractiveness of the radical
for kahlo however choosing to don the costume of the tehuana as for example in tree of hope fig was to embody a powerful icon of cultural identity
mexican indian dress is extraordinarily diverse and by and large geographically specific varying from region to region
the tehuana dress is by no means the most decorative variant or the closest to forms of clothing
it is the mythology surrounding the women wearers of the costume which directed kahlo choice
the ostensibly matriarchal society of tehuantepec led to the adoption of the tehuana in mexico as the image of the strong indian woman the undefeated counterpart to the despised chingada who conversely is the female embodiment of mexico hybrid culture
in a culture where sexual metaphors are frequently used to convey racial and political conflict the tehuana represents that aspect of mexico indigenous tradition unbowed by centuries of colonial and male rule
kahlo adoption of tehuana dress while being an attractive disguise of what she saw as a less than perfect body asserted both a feminist and an position

vogue february
fig
the independent on sunday april
in kahlo work there is a powerful mix of these discourses yet her role as an archetypal woman painter has come to dominate responses to her work
it is through her emergence as a cult painter of the feminist movement of the that her current reputation has evolved
her work almost perfectly illustrates debates as to the nature of traditional exclusions of a woman art
the fascination with functions of the body the analogies between artistic and physical creative processes used to reveal the female body as the site of patriarchal aesthetic discourse all of these mirror the concerns of many women painters of the

in their formal language kahlo works are exemplary of certain feminist arguments the adoption of the decorative the intimate and art mediums reveals the restrictive nature of traditional definitions of high art
this appropriateness of kahlo aesthetic to contemporary debate has tended to remove her work from its historical context to stress the collective and the
although this is not in itself to be dismissed as a tactic it has diminished the complexity of kahlo achievement as a specifically mexican painter operating within the particularities of her historical moment
more problematic is the way in which such a dislocation has led to the acceptance of her mexicanness as mere decoration of the essentially feminist themes of her work thereby defusing a substantial part of the art described by breton as a ribbon round a bomb
it is the ribbon that runs through the pages of vogue the glossy surface of the images in direct opposition to a work such as kahlo the suicide of dorothy hale fig
in this painting a memorial to a woman tragic death is transformed into an indictment of the culture which destroyed her
hale suicide became a poignant metaphor for the oppressive nature of the social values of new york and north america in general
the story behind hale death was one with which kahlo obviously identified and within which dress formed an important symbolic function
before jumping from the window of her apartment hale had dressed meticulously in her most flattering dress the corsage of yellow roses a gift from a male admirer
in kahlo painting the figure falls from the fantasy world she has inhabited to the harsh bloodspattered reality of the street literally coming down to earth
hale eyes stare knowingly at the viewer a human sacrifice to an alienated and consumerist culture
the horizontality of her fallen body is juxtaposed to the vertical thrust of the apartment building
she leaps from an architectural monument to a phallocentric world
although destroyed she has also escaped
the painting dedicated to hale mother was commissioned by a mutual friend of kahlo and dorothy hale the managing editor of vanity fair clare boothe luce
the painting was agreed to by luce in part to recompense for what she saw as her misjudgment of her dead friend
having lent hale money to pay her rent she had been angered to discover her spending enormous sums on an dress and refused to turn up to what in retrospect became hale farewell party
later it was revealed that the money had come from a different source
a male friend had tried to dissuade hale from seeking a much needed job and had given her a thousand dollars to buy the most beautiful dress in new york telling her that what she needed was to find a rich husband
on one level this work deals with a generalised woman experience yet the metaphorical power of dorothy hale dress derives from kahlo use of clothing in her own
dress not only covers and decorates the body but instils in the wearer its own characteristic strengths and weaknesses
hale black velvet dress is cursed because it represents the values of the gringolandia so hated by kahlo
in those paintings where kahlo wears european dress she is passive weak and unable to control her own destiny but in the tehuana costume she is strong powerful hopeful
unclothed her body becomes yet more vulnerable but as jean franco states
the unclothed body is not a self but a socialised body a body that is opened by instruments technologized wounded its organs displayed to the outside world
the inner frida is controlled by modern society far more than the clothed frida who often marks her deviation from the norm by defiantly returning the gaze of the viewer
kahlo naked body becomes not just the tortured self of her personal biography but a visual counterpart to the injured and defiled manifestations of mexico colonised past la llorona the weeping woman of popular myth and la chingada the raped and abused mother described in paz the labyrinth of solitude
descended from an aztec mother goddess llorona is a mother figure symbolic in a wider sense of the trauma of the spanish invasion
driven mad with grief by the loss of her child she is thought to wander the streets weeping and crying out a ghostly memory of the past
at its most simple la chingada as the mother of mestizo culture is the mother forcibly opened violated or deceived
the female soil possessed and misused by the masculine force of the spanish invaders
the indian mexico raped and abused by the conquistador yet bearing his bastard child
the rhetoric of the tehuana opposes the nihilism of traditional feminisations of colonial trauma and asserts the potential of a dignified cultural resistance

a major though often ignored work by kahlo demonstrates the cultural politics underlying her art
my dress hangs there fig is one of the artist s most formally adventurous works mixing photographic collage with paint to produce a critique of north american culture
kahlo does not appear in the work her tehuana costume hangs empty in the centre of the composition suspended between a toilet bowl and a golfing trophy
on one level my dress is a coda to on the borderline fig of the previous year
this small painting on metal in the style of a catholic votive image shows the artist poised between the technological inhumanity of a capitalist north america and the archaic fertility of mexico
interwoven with these images are subtler references to the metaphorical borderlines which separate latin american culture from that of europe and north america
this is done by a series of juxtapositions the past versus the present female nature versus masculine technology growth versus exploitation and in its very material presence the traditions of fine art versus the popular
at the same time the ambivalence of her own and modern mexico position is manifested in the figure of the artist
the paper flag of her homeland is contrasted to the modernity of the cigarette held in her other hand
the red and green of the aztec necklace links it compositionally with the indigenous plants to the south of the painting the pink dress tonally blending with the skyscrapers to the north
my dress again suggests a conflict but the ambivalence is gone
nature has been banished technology and its concomitant values reign over a harshly masculine world
three elements refer to the female presence all of them dealing with an essential lack
the empty dress a peeling poster of mae west and in the far distance the statue of liberty

in the forefront of this scene flutters the dress incongruously vibrant despite its suggestion of loss
dislocated from its political context it hangs like a above the teeming streets of the city decorative yet potentially explosive
there is no place there for the values the tehuana dress represents its folds are given meaning by kahlo search for a cultural identity
within the confines of the painting it becomes a silent emblem of protest a reminder of political alternatives
the physicality so characteristic of kahlo work is missing no flesh no blood just the tawdriness of the peeling poster and the hollow reminder of lost liberty
the of body and dress so referred to in many of kahlo most polemical works fig has been strangely inverted by her current popularity
her mexicanness has become a stylistic gloss decorative colourful pretty even individualistic
the colonised body which kahlo clothed in revolutionary idealism has lost its function as a symbol of nationhood becoming instead an icon of female suffering
what is obscured by this process is that it was through clothing in both art and life that kahlo attempted to redress the wrongs of history

jackboots beneath the serge television
by hugh hebert
there was one point when the hair on the back of my head began to lift
not at paul hill remembrance of beatings past when he could hear the sound of boots running to take part in the fun and once heard a principal medical officer no less telling colleagues do walk his face do walk his face
not even the time he was dunked head first in a tub of dubious liquid and brought up gasping for breath make him sing god save the queen they shouted
brutality as hill describes and felt it was a bitter part of his prison life you just learnt to get down on the floor as fast as you could and cover up as best you could
but it was gerry conlon account of being interrogated after the guildford bombings that made the scalp crawl
we know your mother works at the royal victoria hospital they told him we know where your sister works and there are sectarian killings down there
they told me they could arrange an accident
and i believed they were capable of murdering my mother i honestly believe they would have murdered my mother that why i signed the statement
the account he gave just after his release was that the threat had been that a british soldier might accidentally shoot one of the women
a few months ago even this would have seemed improbable
you might have assumed this was the police bluffing and bullying
yet given what we have learned about links between the security services and the loyalist paramilitaries in northern ireland and the deep suspicion about surrogate murders you ca shrug off the shiver conlon words bring
there were daunting moments in last night first tuesday yorkshire but few of them matched that hint of a jackboot under the blue serge
it right that the guildford four have told their stories now to grant mckee and ros franey and first tuesday the programme and the producers who dug away and did much to keep the case alive
and they told it without questioning though the programme is skilfully structured to give it a coherence it might have lacked
carole richardson is the most haunting face
you have to hope that its blankness will slowly dissolve and let life in
just once a couple of tears rolled down
it was when she described seeing film of the results of the bombing on television and thinking they think i did that
armstrong seems the least permanently damaged on the surface
he pays tribute to his treatment at gartree prison he apologises to the bomb victims families that they have had to keep reminding them of their loss but we had to fight for our freedom
hill expresses the way time has cheated them his daughter was born while he was remanded in custody and is now she would change dramatically and i did feel a change in myself mentally
i still in my head
nothing happened to me
i have lived
but again it was conlon the slightly irish poet of the quartet articulate flamboyant remember that extraordinary exit through the front door of the old bailey who cut deep into the collective conscience
he described being taken over the years to see his sick and finally dying and almost certainly innocent father in another prison
he was convicted with the maguires in the parallel case of a bomb factory
and he tells how none of the assembled guards and officials could look his father in the eye as he protested his innocence
only the nurses could do that
and at the end conlon drew the one hopeful conclusion if this stops capital punishment ever coming back the time i spent in prison will be well worth it
if this stops another innocent person going to prison it be well worth it
i had numerous prison governors say to me yes conlon we know you innocent but there nothing we can do about it
we get a custody order and that it
what sort of system of justice is that
it was the only programme last night to shine light into dirty corners
inside the brotherhood granada produced by claudia milne and martin short dug into the most notorious area of masonic influence local government
in southend where of the adult males are reckoned to be masons it went into the case of what you might call preferential allocation of council property and the battle of one councillor christopher hudson to break the grip of the men on the square we ca have a secret society operating within the framework of a democracy he said
it a paradox it a nonsense
though over the years from southend to tyneside and the government own property services agency there all too much evidence that this is exactly what we do have

parliament urged to think again on housing issue
queen bench divisional court sandwell metropolitan borough council v bujok before lord justice watkins and mr justice hutchison november
if a dwelling house is in such a state of disrepair as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance the tenant may lay an information against his landlord alleging the existence of a statutory nuisance under the public health act
the tenant is not obliged to ensure that the landlord is aware of the defects in the premises or to give the landlord an opportunity to remedy the defects before commencing legal proceedings
although that is the position in law the court emphasised that as a matter of commonsense a tenant should first complain to the landlord before exercising the right to prosecute
the facts
mrs bujok and her family occupied a house as council tenants
in september mrs bujok laid an information against the council alleging the existence and continuance of a statutory nuisance under section of the public health act
it was alleged that the council being the owners of the premises were the persons by whose act default or sufferance the nuisance arose
prior to laying the information mrs bujok had not served an abatement notice upon the council or informed them of the alleged defects in the premises
the justices held mrs bujok was not required to ensure that the council were aware of the defective state of the property prior to laying the information
the council appealed by case stated
the legislation
section of the act defines statutory nuisances as any premises in such a state as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance
the decision
mr justice hutchison said the act primarily envisages a system where the local authority has a power and a duty to try to secure that premises are not in a state which constitutes a statutory nuisance
action is initiated by the service of an abatement notice requiring remedial work
if the person in default fails to comply with an abatement notice the local authority is obliged to make a complaint to the magistrates
if the complaint is proved a nuisance order is made requiring the defendant to get the necessary work done
effectively the sequence is that the person in default is told what is wrong and is required to put it right
he is given an opportunity to do so and if he does not he is subject to sanctions by the court to compel him to do so
the problem arises in connection with section which adapts or applies the provisions to cases where an individual rather than the local authority wishes to make the complaint
need he serve an abatement notice
the authorities plainly establish that he need not and can not do so
does that mean he may lay an information and bring the matter before the magistrates without first putting the person alleged to be in default on notice of what is alleged
the council argued that a landlord particularly one such as a local authority can not realistically be expected to have a system of inspection of all its premises and in practice is entitled to depend upon notification by its tenants
for mrs bujok it was argued that the act was designed to secure in the interests of the community at large that statutory nuisances did not exist
it was submitted that an owner can not turn his back on his property because when he purchases and takes on the responsibility of letting he knows the property will in the course of time deteriorate
he must therefore satisfy himself on a regular basis that it does not constitute a statutory nuisance
in warner v lambeth london borough council hlr lord justice glidewell said a private person could lay an information alleging the failure to abate a statutory nuisance without first giving notice requiring abatement
therefore in the present case the justices came to the correct conclusion
his lordship reached that decision without enthusiasm because it seemed that as a matter of common sense notice should be given in such circumstances before criminal proceedings were launched
lord justice watkins said he agreed with reluctance
it was surely repugnant to commonsense that in this area of legal activity a local authority should be prosecuted by one of its tenants without first being given the opportunity by that tenant to remedy the consequences of a neglect to repair the dwelling that the tenant occupied
in law there was no doubt that mrs bujok was entitled to commence proceedings without giving notice of the state of the dwelling to the council
but in every other conceivable way that action was entirely wrong
endless trouble to many people in courts and council offices and much money could be saved by the giving of notice of disrepair
if the council did not react to that notice then would be the time for the tenant to exercise the right to prosecute
parliament should give fresh thought to enacting a provision placing an obligation upon a council tenant to give notice to the council before being permitted to commence proceedings

leinster face an uphill task
by robert armstrong in dublin
the all blacks begin the irish leg of their tour at lansdowne road today against leinster who have never beaten a major touring side
leinster have named a team that looks strong on paper including eight internationals yet they recently lost to both munster and ulster in the championship
such is the mood of pessimism here it is hard to find anyone who believes the all blacks having won their seven matches in wales will face any significant threat during the next fortnight
ulster the provincial champions may well fancy their chances on november but leinster look certain to face an uphill struggle even though the tourists have rested of the team that beat wales
leinster will be hard pushed to keep the score within the respectable margins of defeat set by their predecessors
in the all blacks defeated leinster they won in and scraped home in
however during the eighties irish provincial rugby has assumed a third world status in relation to new zealand
leinster have been undermined by their failure to secure prestige fixtures since the
when new zealand last toured ireland in leinster were ignored
the same thing happened in when the province was denied a fixture against the wallabies
such neglect has done nothing for their confidence
even so the all blacks who include seven capped players will give today opponents due respect
as their coach alex wyllie remarked when we arrived in wales we were told cardiff were no damned good and look how well they played against us
leinster are quite capable of doing the same
wyllie is confident his western samoan wing tuigamala will play although he is still niggled by an ankle injury received against neath two weeks ago
the test flanker alan whetton whose hamstring injury kept him out against wales will form a powerful back row with kevin schuler and the international zinzan brooke
the tourists will field four backs aged or under
for their part leinster are boosted by the presence of four players already selected for ireland to play new zealand in dublin on november
they are brendan mullin the lions centre fergus aherne the and the two new caps nick popplewell at and brian smith the
no doubt smith the oxford university australian who won five caps for the wallabies will feel a bit closer to home facing the all blacks twice in the next days
it will be fascinating to see how smith a gifted footballer shapes up in his prospective international partnership with aherne
equally intriguing will be the performance of the young london irish lock neil francis who has been left out of the current ireland squad
fortunately leinster front five which includes the experienced prop des fitzgerald looks upto the task of scrummaging against the all blacks
however real problems may arise once leinster attempt to win the loose ball
leinster will be led by their third captain in as many matches the centre paul clinch
leinster f dunlea j sexton p clinch capt b mullin p purcell b smith f aherne n popplewell n kearney d fitzgerald n francis b rigney p kenny k leahy a blair

i write in response to judith raymont november who wrote of the cartoon men a user guide it is either insulting to men and should not be endorsed by publication or it is witty and amusing in which case we as women have no right to complain about equivalent portrayals of female stereotypes
it does not matter if the cartoon is insulting to men
the number of such cartoons is so small that set against the insults to women broadcast by every newsagent and television channel only a loony masculist would object to them
before raymont works towards ways of showing respect understanding and affection to members of the opposite sex she should realise that the opposite sex obsession with members is a problem of enormous gravity
there is nothing respectful understanding or affectionate about page three
w j gaskill male east kilbride
iwould agree that male and female stereotypes portrayed in cartoons are equally abhorrent were it not for the fact that whilst one pokes fun at a powerful group in society men the other perpetuates the oppression of a powerless group women
in an ideal world there would be no need for either but for now i would rather see the frustration expressed in these terms than in the sort of bitterness that has given feminism such a bad name

soccer littlewoods cup fourth round oldham athletic arsenal double by ritchie ends wait
by stephen bierley
oldham athletic who had never beaten a first division side since they dropped into the second division in made up for years of not altogether patient waiting with a pulsating victory over the league champions arsenal at boundary park last night
the pennines fairly shook
no supporter of the latics dared dream it but suddenly the improbable was a throbbing joyous reality
two goals from the irrepressible andy ritchie his and this season and a third by the midfield player nick henry and arsenal were sunk with only the trace of a goal by quinn
despite many and varied flurries of activity in the first minutes arsenal seemed reasonably secure if not inspired
they held their line and competed hard in midfield damping down oldham initial verve and preparing themselves for more of the same in the second half
then oldham struck
winterburn almost put the ball into his own net from milligan cross recovering an awkward situation
almost immediately smith had an excellent chance for arsenal but stumbled
oldham took up the attack again and barlow who had a fine match at totally containing rocastle floated in a deep cross beyond winterburn
the predatory ritchie chested the ball down and hammered a volley past lukic
arsenal had no choice but to attack as soon as the second half began
a neat by rocastle sent thomas hurtling in on goal but rhodes moved sharply off his line to smother the shot
from the resulting corner rhodes made another fine save hurtling to his right to deflect away dixon rising shot
finally with arsenal pressing hard he clawed away quinn careful header from thomas
quinn held his head in disbelief
worse far worse was to follow
bunn who scored six goals in the previous round against scarborough this time turned into the provider putting milligan clear and free
he was hauled back on the edge of the area by a professional foul for which the arsenal central defender was booked
holden clattered the wall and the ball fell to henry who drilled a low shot from more than yards inside lukic post
in another minutes any remaining oldham doubts were dispelled
ritchie passed to irwin and then ran on to head the cross past lukic
arsenal were stitched and stuffed with no question of a fluke
not for the first time this season their defence had been found wanting and oldham exploited the weaknesses to the full owing a special debt to the inspiration and tireless running of henry and milligan
george graham was not amused
he called his team performance unacceptable
but he also said let not take any credit away from oldham
they were tremendous and outplayed us in the first half
the plastic pitch is no excuse
we trained on an artificial pitch for two days this week and we should have done a lot better
joe royle the oldham manager was full of praise both for graham and his own team
george was brilliant he said
he could have blamed this and that but he said we deserved it
the manager attitude shows why they are champions
he took it on the chin
one or two people will be ready to put this down to plastic but our goals were nothing to do with plastic
this was a great performanc
we rattled them from the first minute and did give them any breathing space
we were for minutes and we scored three great goals
in the past we have had cup walks not runs

prototyping is crucial to systems development argues ian richards tailored to fit
in systems development nothing is more fundamental than assessing user requirements
if you do know what the system is required to do you do know anything
but many system developers are unable to assess requirements properly
they seem to think that you can ask a businessman what his requirements are and get an answer that amounts to a draft system specification
a doctor does ask his patient what treatment to prescribe
the patient can explain only what the problem is
it is the doctor that provides the remedy
if you ask a user what sort of system he wants you will be met with a blank look
a user may have a deep knowledge of business problems but knowing little about computers has no idea how they should be tackled
yet analysts are heard asking time and again tell me what you want
we gone awayfrom the days of systems imposed by the data processing department this is going to be a system for the users
but of course the users do know what they want so they end up getting another duff system
an effective analyst provides the same service to the business as the doctor provides to the patient
he finds out what the needs of the business are and prescribes the cure
the user tells the analyst what the problems are and the analyst decides at least in broad terms what the user requires
but the analyst has one great advantage over the doctor
once the user becomes familiar with the proposed system helpful comments come thick and fast
oh this will be of great help in ordering raw materials but sometimes we get part deliveries could we have an extra facility to deal with those
and sometimes discount is given a pig to deal with on the old system but if you could add one extra input box on that screen there
and what about orders not delivered on time
if we could list those we have advance warning of shortage problems on the assembly lines two months before they occur
now that would be a great leap forward
unfortunately you can not reach this stage until you have developed a prototype system
and you ca develop a prototype system because the users have got a clue what they want
most of them are probably muttering i too busy to get involved in this sort of thing
what wrong with the old system anyway
the only way to develop a prototype is for the analyst to get inside the head of the user and thinking like a user decide what sort of system is required
of course the initial system will not be perfect
the analyst can not hope to understand the business as well in a few weeks as the user does after many years
but once the user sees the system channels of communication will open
instead of persuading the user to specify requirements the analyst will be driven by the user to meet key needs
good system development goes through two distinct phases
initially the analyst does all the work leading the user towards a system he thinks is right for the business
but once the user sees the potential of the system a change in attitude takes place
the process becomes demand driven by the user
the analyst is then forced on the defensive explaining why new features can not be included because they are technically difficult or prohibitively expensive
traditionally systems were validated by users agreeing functional specifications
in theory validation meant that the user had read the specification imagined how the system would work in practice and agreed the design
it was only when using a test version of the system available just before the planned implementation date that difficulties would come to light and a host of change requests be issued
the advent of fourth generation languages has made system development much easier
with a an initial prototype can be put together quickly
this means feedback is obtained early in the development process and the system can grow around the user requirements
crucial to the development process is the relationship built up between the analyst and the user
the best systems arise when both have a deep understanding of each other jobs
many developers use business analysts to ensure that the development team maintain a proper focus on business requirements
but this can be as it cuts off communication between the systems analyst and the user
too much specialisation is bad for systems development it feeds the temptation to get engrossed in technical difficulties and forget about the underlying business needs
if you should stroll into a pub and meet an analyst and a user talking about work and you can not tell one from the other they have probably developed a successful system together

alternatively it may be able to muster enough support from seaco shareholders to halt the current disposal of assets by mr sherwood for its bid with stena to be fully considered

edoardo amaldi
ragazzi of distinction
in december the men working feverishly to create the first american atomic bomb sent a team of spooks to naples
one of their main assignments was to contact edoardo amaldi a physicist thought to be in hiding near rome
six months later the day before rome liberation by the allies amaldi was found
he was interviewed by moe berg then one of the most famous baseball players in america
berg was also an agent of the office of strategic services which was later to give birth to the cia
his job was to convince amaldi to pack his bags because there was a ship waiting at naples to take him to the united states
amaldi presence there had been sought by two other italian colleagues also physicists
his mentor enrico fermi later to be called the father of the bomb and emilio segre who died in california earlier this year
amaldi dodged the american invitation perhaps because with rome liberated fermi mantle in physics had fallen on his young shoulders and there were younger minds to teach
he wore that mantle well at rome university until his retirement in
but amaldi never really retired nor grew old
he kept regular hours in the university physics building spoke at scientific meetings this year in moscow and washington
as president of the accademia nazionale dei lincei he had delivered the welcoming address on tuesday to a symposium of scientists
he then ordered a car to call for him the next morning for a similar occasion and was felled by a stroke while waiting for the lift
amaldi grew up in a small town in lombardy and took his doctorate in physics from rome at the remarkably early age of
in he became one of the ragazzi di via panisperna the street where fermi kids carried out their own experiments under the master in their own lab
emilio segre was one kid and bruno pontecorvo later to defect from britain to the soviet union another
it is interesting to note that the pope as the kids called fermi because he always right was only seven years older than amaldi
amaldi astounded his group in october with his discovery that by slowing down rather than accelerating neutrons he could provoke intense nuclear reactions
he held a chair in physics from until his retirement publishing more than papers on atomic and nuclear physics
he was awarded honorary degrees by algiers glasgow and oxford
he became a founder and active executive of the european centre for nuclear research in geneva
i had the pleasure of two long talks last year with professor amaldi about his knowledge of what the german physicists were doing with their atoms during the war years
apart for his incongruously white hair amaldi seemed to have the mental lucidity and expected energy of a man half his age
his modesty considering his fame in his field was endearing
i knew almost nothing about physics but we shared some jokes about the rome telephone system
in amaldi wrote to the italian prime minister asking for permission to produce and sell sealing wax for letters so that we may raise needed funds for our physics lab
the reply came from an who said that the present funding was considered adequate and the commercial undertaking would be

it has employed a dual strategy to achieve these two objectives
first a comprehensive civil disobedience campaign was begun by which people severed or minimised all the contact points by which they were bound to the israeli occupation authority
this campaign included resignations of palestinian officials from public posts the boycott of israeli goods and products and the refusal to pay taxes and fines
partial and full strikes demonstrations conventions all these have in fact only constituted the outer layer of an inner mechanism of civilian rebellion
the second and complementary part of the intifada strategy concentrated on the construction of an indigenous national authority
as israel authority was being lifted the population began creating an alternative authority of their own
popular committees were established in villages refugee camps suburbs streets in fact in every community
some headway was made in expanding whether through utilising more land for agriculture developing home economies or encouraging local manufacturers and products
villages and refugee camps were thus being developed into liberated or independent areas if not militarily then at least psychologically politically and infrastructurally
bloody clashes would occur whenever armoured units raided these villages storming through makeshift defensive road blocks and responding to rocks being thrown with live bullets and tear gas but no sooner would these army units be gone than authority would revert to the village residents
palestinian flags would be raised on minarets and church spires road blocks would again be erected and life in all its aspects would once again be run by the local leadership
the structure of the developing national authority has been both diffuse enough to prevent it from being destroyed by any one single sweep of arrests there have been more than arrests since the intifada outbreak and coherent enough to allow for the existence of a unified resistance strategy
while the entire network of popular committees local institutions and the general public constitute the field commanders in the battle of civilian disobedience and of constructing a political infrastructure a rotating unified national command acts in the role of issuing a directive outlining policy and determining specific resistance programmes
a high level of mobility in the structure allows for continuous interchange of roles and ideas and retains for the unified national command the closeness to grass roots that is required to make it truly reflect people wishes and sentiments
this expanded network of popular committees and institutions making up the unified leadership is infused by tens of thousands of activists who belong to or identify with the different factions of the plo
in effect therefore the plo exists at all levels of organisation within the occupied territories
thus the palestinian national movement both inside and outside the occupied territories is an organic whole
the pattern of the intifada has been cyclical
thrusts of resistance mass demonstrations resignations tax rebellions etc would come in crests
the pattern is determined by a wide variety of factors including what the israeli army does
but the relation is complex not
harsh measures putting an entire community under an absolute curfew for a continuous lengthy period of time demolishing homes uprooting olive or citrus trees physical intimidation and terror tactics employed by raiding army units shooting killing cutting off water or electricity supplies and telephone links to villages or towns mass arrests intimidatory interrogation techniques can either create a temporary lull or activate an eruption
the army never knows which it will be
it is as if it is walking through a minefield
the pattern of the intifada its pains and sufferings are all reminiscent of the process of birth
the metaphor is apt as palestinians regard themselves as engaging in a process of giving birth to their independent palestinian state
through their revolution the masses are both mother and midwife to the birth of this state
the intifada is the midwife of freedom
through it palestinians are struggling on a daily basis to shake off israel authority and to construct their own
the struggle reflects a revolution in mass consciousness by which people have come to realise that ideas and aspirations must be embodied in manifest acts if reality is to be changed
thus wherever one looks one finds people engaged in the construction of the blocks that will make up the palestinian state
it is a conscious effort
the masses are being engaged in the craft of
in this process of state building many stages have been covered
the declaration of independence issued by the palestine national council pnc on november last year constitutes a major landmark along this road
its significance lies in its double message that the aim of the palestinian struggle is the establishment of palestinian independence and that this independence is regarded as being not at israel expense
this has been a constant theme of intifada policy that we wish to build palestine not to destroy israel that we wish to achieve freedom for our people not to deprive others israelis of it that we wish to protect and save lives ours not to endanger the lives of others israelis
in one of several intifada leaflets written in hebrew and addressed to the israeli soldiers on duty in the occupied territories the message was repeated soldier go home
return to your family and children
be with them in peace so that we may remain with our family and children in peace
we do not wish to harm you or your state
we wish to be unharmed in our own state
how can the process of state building be developed
if the pnc declaration of independence constituted a major landmark in this process the time has come to embark on another major step that of declaring the setting up of a state or government structure
an escalation of the intifada in this direction would serve two purposes at once
first it would consolidate the structures of the developing national authority which is competing to replace the occupation authority
second it would consolidate the image and essence of the intifada as a constructive not a destructive force
naturally to embark on such a step is not necessarily to succeed immediately in realising it
rather it is a challenge
it will be a further challenge to israel occupation conceived in the image of earlier challenges of the intifada
but it will also be a challenge to us palestinians summoning us to work more energetically towards the idea fulfilment
it would be a natural extension of the intifada dual strategy towards disengagement from israel and the corresponding process of state building
it would further naturalise and legitimise the evolving skeletal form of palestinian independence
it would provide the multitudinous popular committees and activities with a more advanced form of organisation and structure
it would enable better planning and performance
it would maximise civilian tactics of resistance and defuse the natural potential for violence containing and eventually eliminating the marginal but intrusive phenomenon of collaborator activation by israeli security authorities and collaborator execution by local palestinians
it would create a further fact that would put israel on the spot
israel reaction however hostile could only further our cause
arresting or deporting the tens of thousands of palestinian professionals who would be employed in perfectly apolitical harmless and humanitarian jobs can only further isolate the israeli government
measures can only imply success
a modus vivendi would also imply success
in general our policy should be to proceed with building our state block by block without waiting to be given a gift of it through negotiations
we should regard negotiations rather as the means by which we could establish formal agreements between our state and israel
such agreements can range from the issue of borders to the issue of free for our future television and radio networks
in the meantime we have the capacity to bring coherence and organisation to a whole range of activities further consolidating the institutional linkage between the people in the occupied state and the plo leadership
entire departments can be set up in health foreign affairs agriculture trade finance education justice religion information and social welfare
a pyramid administrative structure establishing links from popular committees in villages right up to the executive committee of the plo in its capacity as a cabinet can be established
during the intifada the people have been engaged in building the side walls
a government would provide the roof which would bring these walls together
it would add another necessary touch in the process of creating a palestinian home

the boy and the dog skirted round opposite sides of the puddle the boy a light tall labouring in wellington boots too large for him and the dog a labrador bitch picking her way reluctantly with frequent pauses as if her paws hurt
the boy unlike the dog knew that the mud did not go on for ever beyond the bridge the disused railway embankment along which they were walking became built up so that water ran off it
he pulled the dog close to him to let a mixed string of horses and ponies go past waving shyly to the lead rider a pretty capable girl an unbridgeable two years older than him
he watched her as she went past at a walk the black labrador and he both gazing wistfully their breath steaming in the cold february morning
he waited till the horses were well away and looked round the wide flat landscape carefully before unclipping the lead
way you go patty he said softly and the dog was off hurling herself along the embankment all paws and flying ears after a rabbit who had been sitting in a patch of sun but disappeared with contemptuous ease as she came close
the boy had been told unequivocally not to let her off the lead the only used the land by grace of its owner and it was a shooting estate but he hated keeping the dog straining at the lead and knew that she would always come to his call
he stood for a moment laughing at her as she cast furiously for the vanished rabbit and walked on to catch her up along the raised embankment
the trees had grown up beside it in the years since the railway had closed and the boy stopped every now and then to watch small birds hopping around the top branches
he particularly liked this stretch nothing but the odd tractor and the horses ever came down this embankment and the birds were unworried by his presence
after half a mile he decided to turn off the embankment and walk up the side of the next field and along the path at the top of it following the horses whom he could still see in the distance
he called patty to him
she did come which was surprising she was a docile creature and particularly devoted to him because he always took her for a walk when he was at the stables
he could hear her barking and looked down over the steep side of the embankment to the bottom of the trees
he called her again and again but she would not stop barking at something he could not see
probably a squirrel he decided and slithered down the side of the embankment to join her scolding as he went
straightening up beside the dog he looked where she was looking and blinked
he saw a leg uncomfortably wedged between sapling trees swollen grotesquely and gazed at it stupidly wondering if it was plastic
as his eyes focused he realized he was looking at a hideously swollen human body and just then as the light breeze shifted he caught the odour of decay
he was a sensible and capable boy an eldest child so he moved closer trying not to breathe and stood steadfastly looking until he was confident of what he had seen a body must be a girl because it was wearing a skirt lying face down head towards the bottom of the embankment as if she had dived off the top
he clipped the lead on to the dog with cold hands which would hardly function and let her pull him up the slope as fast as he could make his legs move
he stopped on the embankment shaking with cold and shock to note the spot then fled along the tractor paths the dog running with him to the stables where the ten children ride was in its closing stages
miss williams
jamie i teaching
the thin capable woman who was taking the looked at him in amazement as he leaned panting on the gate to the ring the dog whining beside him
i sorry
please i found something i must tell you
she had known him since he was a very small perched like a mosquito on one of the placid beginners ponies so she told the class to carry on walking their ponies while she came to him
there someone dead
below the railway embankment
are you sure
the boy looked at her and uncontrollable tears suddenly filled his eyes
he was very nearly as tall as her but she put an arm under his shoulders and supported him to the untidy room which served as the stable office calling to one of the stable girls to take over the class
patty found her
she just lying there but she is dead
he scrubbed at his face with the handkerchief she offered and gulped for air
i ring the police
she did so casting an experienced eye over him
sit down here jamie and i make some tea
mummy will come back in a few minutes wo she for susie
not mummy
aunt margaret is coming at ten
the boy thought longingly of his mother but managed to help miss williams describe the location of the body to a startled local station sergeant and to drink a cup of sweet milky tea without being sick
by the time his aunt arrived jamie was so far recovered as to be able to refuse to go home and to point out severely that he would be needed either to assist the police or to be lead rider in the class or possibly both
he watched his aunt and miss williams wordlessly consult each other but knew his aunt would do as she was told successful solicitor though she was she was ten years younger than miss williams and as she complained totally intimidated by her as she had not been by anyone since her late headmistress
he was unsurprised to find her packed off firmly to take his sister home leaving him as a person of major importance in what he instantly assumed to be a real murder
miss williams took him to meet the police land rover at the stable gate a wiry woman in her late fifties her expression sufficiently forbidding to prevent the parents edging cars through the gate to collect children from the ten ride from asking any questions
jamie through a renewed queasiness just observed that the police driver was instantly reduced to half his age by miss williams greeting
he was one of my boys she said in explanation to the cid sergeant who was leading the party as they bumped over the rough road through the thick mud and on to the dry embankment
like jamie here
did you recognize the person you found young man the sergeant asked carefully
no
tears started into jamie eyes
she was all swollen
the sergeant eyes widened and he slid out of the land rover and stood back to let jamie out
very competent boy
almost a professional singer handles himself very well
miss williams natural pitch well suited to reaching across a was discreetly reduced
the cid sergeant thanked her gravely and went to stand beside jamie who was peering down the embankment looking pinched
we go down together lad
there is room
i lead
he took a deep breath and headed down the sergeant two constables and miss williams in his wake
soon they all stood side by side one of the younger policemen coughing involuntarily
oh dear oh dear miss williams said on an indrawn breath
sorry
come along jamie let get you back
she took out a handkerchief and mopped her eyes
the police driver shot jamie a look of enquiry which he missed occupied as he was with guiding miss williams back up the hill
he had seen her weep before but only for a sick horse and he was
jamie did you let patty off the lead
the boy blushed to his ears and owned to it
you must not do it jamie we be in trouble with colonel james i told all you boys a thousand times
he perhaps not do it again the sergeant murmured and received the look that miss williams habitually bent on a child who was riding carelessly
how long had she been there
jamie asked anxiously
a few days the sergeant said grimly
how many
doctor tell us
he considered the boy thoughtfully and decided to take him back quickly
these teenagers were in his experience a lot less tough than they looked
any idea who it could be he asked miss williams casually
no
but only a local would know to put a body there
if jamie had let the dog off the lead she could have been there much longer
the sergeant nodded deciding it could do no harm to concede a point he had already taken
no one could tell who she was surely
miss williams said quietly to him sounding shaky
she did even look human
the sergeant confirmed that that happened with bodies after a few days
we identify her though he said reassuringly
somebody will likely have reported her missing
he stopped abruptly as he remembered a conversation earlier that week and lit a cigarette thinking furiously
this could be the girl whom the yard were looking for and he had better do everything very quickly indeed including finding his chief who would then want to find his chief constable and notify scotland yard
presumably it would be the yard who investigated this one rather than the regional crime squad
he chewed his thumbnail as he walked out of long experience keeping in mind the highest priorities ensure body not moved and ensure next of kin notified before the press got the story
he posted the detective constable he had with him back down the path to join his colleague armed with instructions to repel all attempts by anyone however senior or armed with whatever authority to go anywhere near the body unless he sergeant black personally accompanied them
then he climbed into the land rover beside his two passengers and drove off fast with the aim of abandoning jamie to the custody of his aunt as quickly as possible
he could see with half an eye that the kid aunt was going to be one of the confident bossy women with whom that part of cambridgeshire was substantially
john mcleish was in his office saturday or no saturday telling himself he needed to catch up on the paperwork
the phone rang and he picked it up frowning
one of the pleasures of saturday working was that the phone did not ring all the time
the voice at the other end was plainly and it took him a minute to disentangle what he was being told
oh congratulations charlie
sorry what did you say it was again
a little girl
actually a very big girl as these things go nine pounds
it fantastic john there she is a new person lying on her face sound asleep
i just left them and i going back
mcleish repressed the malicious thought that this event might put francesca nose just a little bit out of joint
she had been utterly secure in her position as the only girl in the wilson family and now there was another one
i got another bit of good news
frannie going to be able to bring tristram home pretty soon apparently
mcleish expressed qualified enthusiasm and charlie assured him he felt exactly the same about his younger brother
the difficulty is that perry does everything that bit better than tristram
not that this is any excuse john i do know
he paused reminding mcleish irresistibly of a labrador wondering how best to approach an acquaintance
i wanted to say you see that i know you thought frannie should have gone and that it ruined your holiday plans and on behalf of us all i sorry
i know the little boys lean on her too much and i would have gone if i could
he coughed embarrassed and a little pompous very much conscious of his new status as a father while mcleish remembered that he was a scant four years older than the delinquent tristram
anyway she should be back soon charlie concluded
mcleish thanked him gravely feeling as he often did with the wilsons that he was being enveloped in a large feather eiderdown and made restless by the call went down the corridor to where he knew catherine crane was also in getting her office in order
he stopped at the door and smiled at her
wearing jeans and a blue shirt she was tugging at a filing cabinet which was too large for her to embrace and which was threatening to on her
she looked about sixteen and beautiful
she let go of the cabinet coughing in the dust of ages that appeared to be lurking behind it and smiled back at him as the february sun shone through the small window behind her throwing into sharp relief the patches on the wall where her predecessor had hung posters and the ingrained dirt on the flaking paintwork round the mean narrow metal window
where do you want that put
mcleish advanced on the cabinet and shifted it authoritatively ignoring the clip on the ankle dealt him by an unsecured bottom drawer apparently full of bricks
i should have unloaded it first catherine crane said apologetically but i just could move in any direction with it where it was
i here just tell me if you want anything else shifted
he hesitated
i going to do another hour then have some lunch if you want to come
he was aware that he was not managing to sound exactly like a senior officer making a recent arrival feel at home but decided not to add any further riders to his invitation
that would be very nice
are we going to the canteen
not if i can help it
what about the pub
if i allowed to buy my own
mcleish considered
that fine on the food i buy the drinks i too old to get used to women buying my drinks
she laughed at him and said gravely that she would be happy to indulge him and he went away grinning
peter yeo was also in his office having told his wife he was lunching with a client
it was he felt just too difficult to be at home at all with claudia in a permanently bitchy mood and both his teenage children taking their cue from her and behaving intolerably
he wandered restlessly about and decided that the lie might as well become the truth
without angela morgan at least two major clients were in danger of not getting the assiduous service they were paying for and it would be well worth trying to see if one of them whom he knew to be a fellow refugee from family life at the weekends could be found
he was in luck and fixed to meet andy barton at brazzo where yeo davis had a table permanently booked
he had to admit that this particular client hardly added to the general decorative smartness of the place
andy barton founder and chief executive of barton textiles was almost as broad as he was long virtually neckless with incongruously long brown hair curling over his collar
his enormous hands dwarfed the elegant menu which he was studying in apparent disbelief and peter yeo noticed again as barton without rising extended one massive paw that though the fingers were an ordinary length it was the width of the palms that made the hands so large
i never see how they get the sales per square foot in these places barton observed without further greeting
i mean they not open twelve hours like my shops and they are using the space
his small bright blue eyes swept disparagingly over the minimalized black and white flooring stainless steel chairs and black wooden bar
they make a huge margin on a smaller turnover andy out of punters like us
peter yeo was amused by and respectful of a man with an obsession
angela not working today
barton worked a day which began with careful detailed consideration of the trading figures and key ratios for every one of his major shops and the output of both factories and continued usually by helicopter with a detailed aerial survey of a particular area as the quick way of identifying new sites interspersed with unheralded descents on the manager of any shop he took a fancy to visit
peter yeo who had known this particular juggernaut since he had his first small factory and two stores and dirt under his fingernails from shifting personally was not fazed by the question
angela taking a few days off she has been well he said easily
i know she been working very hard for you
i up to speed with huerter of course but is your planning application in leicester all right
barton assured him warmly that angela had done a great job and he was now confident of getting planning permission on the vast site he had wanted
peter yeo who knew him in this mood decided to prod gently
angela said the council wanted it for housing
yeah some of them did
silly buggers it jobs they want there first
plenty of housing if those stupid farts at the council got round to repairing it and stopped their tenants tearing apart what they have got
my mum brought up five of us in a flat far worse than what these immigrants complain about
peter yeo who had personally persuaded barton of the presentational disadvantage of using words like darkies niggers or wogs decided that immigrants even though used in the manner of one invoking a curse was as good as he was going to get with this particular client
she doing a good job on sorting this huerter thing too
bloody ridiculous them blokes at the dti pushing assistance for huerter
i voted for this government because they said they were going to go in for that sort of rubbish
no one ever gave me anything and my business works
still angie can fix the treasury on this one given her boyfriend ca she
that the reason i wanted you on this
peter yeo winced inwardly but he was not going to tell andy barton that angela was missing or express any of his reservations about how much influence angela could bring to bear
he smoothly changed the subject to the looks of the blond model three tables away and barton agreed he would mind a bit of that on the thin side mind you but tasty
the rest of lunch passed in similar diversion interspersed with details of last week turnover which were never far from barton mind whatever other distractions offered
mrs huntley was having lunch with her daughter
she ate placidly acknowledging to herself with her customary good sense that at the moment as at any time since her brother william had died she and penelope were getting no pleasure at all from each other company
penelope was looking particularly discontented and disaffected picking at her food
her red suit was smart but too bright a colour for her pale english pink and white skin her brown hair could have done with a wash and her nails were ragged and bitten
she was frowning deep lines appearing between her eyebrows mouth drawn down at the edges so that instead of a classically slim english rose in her late twenties she looked faded years older than her real age and shrewish
mrs huntley sighed her brother whom she had loved but knew to be to a fault had done his niece real harm by leaving so much of his money away from the girl who had confidently believed herself to be his favourite thing on earth
penelope however it had to be acknowledged had made no attempt to rise above the blow she had been dealt by finding a dazzling girl of her own age favoured over herself in her uncle will
at least mrs huntley thought hopefully she had stopped wondering unbecomingly and stridently how her uncle could have been fooled by angela morgan
it was grizel huntley own view that her brother had not been fooled at all but had been charmed and diverted by a dashing girl thirty years his junior and had seen no reason at all why she should not have a share of his considerable estate when that left a very decent for his niece as well
indeed she had respected angela morgan for the straightforwardness with which she had tackled the issue when they had met at the lawyer office
i sorry you disappointed she had said to penelope but after all there a lot of money quite enough for both of us
so there was grizel huntley acknowledged and it would be a great deal better if penny could manage to think a bit more positively
if she has vanished i going to see that solicitor about whether i can get her presumed dead
penny sounding childishly sullenly determined broke into her mother thoughts
grizel huntley looked across at her shocked
i would wait a little if i were you
penelope glared at her turning an ungraceful scarlet but mrs huntley held her ground
you are being silly about this penny
you are letting this disappointment and that all it is you still a very young woman get in the way of everything
penelope choked on her pudding and started to cry angry uncontrollable tears
grizel huntley reached out to comfort her but she forced back her chair and fled clutching her handbag and napkin leaving her mother with the ruins of lunch
fifty miles north sarah morgan had just finished serving a lunch that no one had done more than pick at
her husband francis had made a slightly better showing than her daughter jennifer who was looking particularly ragged
mother and daughter were very like each other tall dark slim women with curly hair and slightly snub noses
francis morgan by contrast was dark almost with bright brown eyes
of medium height and packed with energy even distressed as he was he was bursting round the kitchen hair still damp at the back from his swim
let go to the flicks
no point at all sitting round looking at each other
come on jennifer or are you going out with michael
he gone back to australia dad
last week
jennifer sounded defeated and he looked at her sideways with familiar love and exasperation
she just did seem to be able to hang on to men he thought impatiently not like his angie wherever she was
giles rang up his daughter volunteered and he was uncomfortably reminded by something in her voice that giles hawick was one of the men jennifer had been able to hang on to or not once he had seen angela
how was he his wife sarah asked rather too quickly
well very worried
he said the police were talking to everyone angie had seen in the two weeks before she well vanished and so far had come up with nothing
i mean no one noticed anything unusual about her and she seemed to be full of plans for the wedding
well i told them that francis morgan said irritably and his wife and daughter caught each other eye in silent agreement that he had told them that angela was refusing to be married from home and was insisting on the full london reception at the house of commons replying unanswerably when he had objected on grounds of expense that she could well afford to pay for it herself
a row of epic proportions had ensued which he and angela had evidently enjoyed but which had left sarah and jennifer sick with distress
i do want to go out frank
someone might ring
sarah morgan was sounding diffident but resolute and as morgan opened his mouth to protest in exasperation the doorbell rang
both women looked at him in joint appeal and he marched to the door pulling it open with unnecessary force
he stood door in hand checked by something in the way his visitors a man and a woman were standing
the man a stocky greying in a navy raincoat over a suit his hair cut short was attended by a uniformed policewoman hair smartly set under the cap her eyes watchful in the wide flat placid face and both of them were standing square and stolid
francis morgan stood and stared at them and even before the man stepped forward steadily hand extended mouth opening to speak he understood who they were and what they had come to tell him
mark sanders returned from istanbul feeling exhausted depressed and ill
the blinding headaches he had been experiencing in recent weeks were taking their toll and he looked grey and drawn when he arrived home
lately georgina had been worried by the general deterioration in his appearance
but now she was visibly shocked by the drained and face which kissed her
she wanted to say you look awful darling but decided against it
what kind of a trip have you had she asked instead
oh not too bad he replied wearily
she took his suitcase and placed it at the bottom of the stairs
come into the kitchen and we will have a cup of tea
i so much news to tell you
all sorts of things seem to have happened while you have been away this time
mark smiled thinly and kissed her affectionately on the cheek
tell me about it he replied
i could do with a good laugh
why darling
what the matter
trouble at
mark slipped an arm around her slim waist as they walked from the hall into the kitchen
perhaps it old montezuma revenge he replied
must be getting too old for this lark or else my youth is catching up on me
i rapidly coming to the conclusion that this is a young man game
nonsense mark
you still a young man well youngish she said trying to tease him out of his apparent lethargy and depression
let have that cup of tea and you feel better
ah fill the cup what boots it to repeat how time is slipping underneath our feet he quoted with a sigh
oh darling
what a sad sack we are today
is that how you feel
shall i accompany you on the violin
now let me tell you all the news
she poured the tea
christopher has been promoted after only one year
the chairman of the company told him he was most impressed with the contribution he made to the business and that he could go right to the top if he keeps it up
i knew you be delighted to hear that
she sipped her tea
next
i found a super husband for harriet
champion of the breed at crufts last year
lives in the next village believe it or not
absolutely magnificent dog
lucky harriet said mark
what else
ah yes a secretary at the ministry of industry wants you to ring him
seems they want you to address the european commission on european industrial development
in dublin i think she said
something about the factors which influence location decisions
anyway you know what it means when you see it
i written it all down
oh and yes a chap from conservative central office rang up to say they like to know if you would be prepared to stand for the european parliament
he sounded somewhat to the right of genghis khan
i said i did think so as you were rather busy but i pass the message on
hope i did the right thing
i said you never knew where you were from one week to the next
he said that would do nicely
just like the american express advertisement
perfect credentials apparently for european parliamentarians
now what next
the have bought an absolutely super villa in sardinia and say we could rent it if we like to
i seen the photographs
gorgeous location overlooking a quiet bay
it sleeps ten with a permanent staff of three
only a thousand pounds a week yacht included
i love that for two or three weeks would you
we would want to stint ourselves mark said facetiously four or five i should think
and we could take the family she said
we have had a family holiday for years
i like that
but we can talk about that later
and i decided to take up riding again
do ask me why
just got the urge that all
she gave him a beautiful smile which lit her lovely face
well how that for starters she asked
he had heard that expression before
is there more
now let me see
ah yes
andrew coming home for the weekend so i thought it would be nice to have a drinks party
i invited the bunkers if that all right
i like clem and gwen and the girls would be nicer company for andrew
fine agreed mark without much enthusiasm
if clem can make it that is
i heard about this latest merseyside strike in istanbul
could finish off the uk vehicle division he said forlornly and don peters he added shaking his head
some of the stupid bastards wo be satisfied until we no longer make a single vehicle in the uk
then i suppose they say it all management fault and people will believe them
and who the hell is management he demanded his voice rising
people like me who worked their guts out to expand the business while the militant bastards have been working their guts out to destroy it
georgina was nodding agreement
she patted his wrist
i quite sure you right dear
but we were talking about the motor industry and the saga
we were talking about andrew coming home for the weekend and having the bunkers round for drinks
and i do wish you would swear like that when you talk about business
you never used to swear you know
at least you did when you were with me
but you do now darling and i do wish you would
you are becoming so hard and bitter and it not really like you
mark sighed
i sorry
it just
it just that there really is trouble at she said quietly
that it is it
you were going to tell me
you were just going to worry about it alone
you let me go rabitting on
he hugged her kissed her cheek
i not sure yet that there really is something to worry about
but you think there is
he nodded
i have a horrible feeling that um is about to reorganise planning operations and if that happens it curtains for the european organisation and for me
curtains she said
what exactly would that mean
early retirement
mark you not serious
i think it could be on the cards
they could transfer me to detroit or somewhere
i do know but i do like the signs
oh mark she said
they would do that to you
they just could
not after all you done for the corporation
they could be that unfair and ruthless
his expression was wry
my dear they do whatever they feel is necessary to do
sentiment loyalty service and track record none of these things will come into it
georgina took him in her arms and kissed him on the lips
it all so ridiculous that we not going to even think about it any more she said firmly hiding her fears
now come into the garden she added smiling
i want to show you the clematis
it a mass of colour
lying in bed that evening they talked a lot about their life together
they recalled their first days
the county ball
the paul jones and the emotional somersaults when the music stopped and they came face to face for the very first time
the wedding
the birth of their first son adam and then christopher and andrew
the children growing up with all the laughter and tears
schooldays and the void they both felt when the boys went off to boarding school followed by the joy unconfined when they came home at the end of term
mark promotions and progress up the company ladder
new and changing homes
friends lost and friends gained
family achievements and disappointments
notwithstanding current problems which they discussed lightly it had all been wonderful
they fell asleep in the early hours of the morning holding hands
the next day mark arrived back at um european headquarters in london and received an early call from muldoon
he went down the airless corridor to his boss office said hello to the secretary and walked into the large room which was as big as the lobby of many a sizeable hotel
muldoon rose immediately from his enormous black leather chair to greet him coming from behind the vast desk with hand outstretched
hello mark
have a good trip
he took the englishman by the arm and ushered him toward the easy chairs arranged around a long rectangular coffee table
instinctively mark felt uneasy
why the hand on the arm and the approach
muldoon never emerged from behind his desk to greet colleagues
only visitors and vips got that special reception
muldoon poured the coffee
how did the planning meeting go
mark asked him
what was nate reaction
did he and the committee go along with my proposals he added
it went fine muldoon said
he seemed somewhat uneasy
klepner did a good job
how did he handle the questions
mark asked
he does have the inside knowledge to deal with questions
oh ok really
i handled some and so did mueller
but klepner did ok
he did let the side down
mark nodded
what was mueller doing answering questions
he was there to ask them
he does know the inside track any more than klepner
maybe not but he soon will muldoon replied quietly
and what does that mean
muldoon seemed to be taking a long time over his coffee
he evaded mark eyes
he goin to world planning operations from detroit
he already the regional plans to provide a world picture
so what changed
deep down he knew
he not going to just and consolidate any longer muldoon said with increasing nervousness
he gon na plan direct and control worldwide planning operations from detroit including the regional planning functions
mark expression was one of faked incredulity
his gut feelings had been right
you got to be joking he scoffed
i know that what mueller always wanted but nate and the executive committee would never fall for that bloody game
the regions are far too big and complex to be handled from detroit and even if they were foolish enough to believe that they could do it more effectively which they ca they would be crazy to try
i know mark i know muldoon said
but that what they gon na do
it will boomerang the englishman said heatedly
overseas governments and local nationals just wo stand for it particularly when they get to know what going on
that one corporate plan that ca win not in the long term
i know mark
but they think they can run everything from detroit and that the way the organisation is going to be restructured
they are working on it right now
we will know the details in a few weeks time
couple of months at the latest
mark said quietly
and how does that affect the european organisation
the organisation will be wound up
i taking early retirement
and me
muldoon shrugged
not certain yet
but my guess is early retirement too unless you prepared to go back to divisional work
local md perhaps
the englishman snorted
you know i ca go back
who the hell can
in any case you know as well as i do that the mds are always american
well there wo be any european job functions that for sure muldoon said
there be a direct link between detroit and the line managers in each country with detroit calling the shots
do they realise they playing with political dynamite
mark demanded
mueller wo give a damn about the effect of a corporate plan on europe and on individual countries
if he wants to import vehicles or components from taiwan or singapore or hong kong into europe he go ahead and do it regardless of the economic consequences for the european countries concerned
the only thing you can be sure of is that us interest will always come first
oh and there one more thing you can be sure of he added sourly
they wo plan to supply the us market from imports
you can bet your bottom dollar on that
jesus wept he continued hackles rising
mueller will have the power to make or break whole areas of europe
he the last guy in the world who should be given such power
the bloody man power drunk already
he was angry and bitter
i know muldoon agreed sadly
then what are you and clancy doing about it
look mark muldoon said forlornly what the point
the wheels have already been set in motion
we not gon na change anyone mind
you know that
his tone was abject
sorry you takin it so bad he added miserably
how else should i take it
mark demanded
it my life which is about to go down the plughole
i not an american on a brief overseas assignment
i spent my entire working life in the european components business
i grown up in it
it in my blood
i built plants and managed them
designed products and marketed and sold them
when i was an apprentice there were two component plants in europe and now there are seventeen and i had a hand in establishing the last twelve
what the hell do you expect me to say
oh is that what they are proposing to do
well bully for mueller and the corporation
i go and collect my hat and coat
i know how you feel mark muldoon said sadly
do you pat
do you
you and have been looking forward to retirement
i fifty and have a long way to go
i do think you can see things the way i see them
well perhaps not muldoon agreed
but i can understand how you feel
the englishman nodded and poured himself more coffee
so what going to happen to the european plan he asked
mueller will drive it from detroit with one or two amendments agreed at the epc meeting muldoon told him
what amendments
no further plant investment in the uk
i suppose mueller saw to that mark said sarcastically
he really hates our guts
god help the british plants under the new regime
muldoon shook his head
no it was that
it was the strike at merseyside
that was the last straw as far as nate was concerned
up until that news hit the committee don had won the day with his uk vehicle division proposals
but as soon as nate heard about the latest strike that was it
end of story
he instructed mueller to vehicle manufacture in the uk
mark nodded
how did don take it
he was beginning to win through
he very upset
naturally
it the first time in his career he has come out on top
mueller is taking over the plan and don is being transferred back to the states
public relations job or something similar
just think of it a man of his talent and ability stooging around the media
so when he going back to the states
mark said
it wo be announced for a week or so but he already been told
he fly out inside the month
and what do you and i do now
mark enquired
start emptying the files
muldoon made a face
afraid so
klepner will take over the files and ship them back to the states
he be mueller european components planning manager in detroit
klepner
mark uttered in mock astonishment
the man knows nothing about europe
he a novice
a bloody charlatan
i know it sounds crazy mark muldoon said
but there it is
we have no choice in the matter
i was instructed to tell you and i have
new york and detroit will come up with an attractive separation package you can be sure of that
they already told me you get the maximum terms permitted under british law
the corporation wants to do the right thing by you
the two men rose from the table together
sure
we have no choice in the matter said the englishman
there has to be losers as well as winners said the american
i guess we both losers mark
the englishman returned to his own palatial office and sat with his head in hands
another of his blinding headaches had developed and he felt a tight sensation in his chest which made breathing very painful and difficult
his secretary entered the room
can i get you a coffee mr sanders
you do look at all well
shall i get the doctor
he looked up and smiled
no thank you millie
i all right
just a headache
be ok in a minute
would love a cup of coffee though
are you sure i should get a doctor she asked
no thank you
i be ok
it only a headache
millie had her reasons for being concerned
the petticoat mafia at the top of the organisation always knew what was going on often before the top executives themselves
millie and the secretaries of pat muldoon and clancy mcgillicuddy were all close friends
they had got together over the weekend to discuss the implications of the confidential letter the two americans had received from randy mueller on behalf of nate cocello
major changes were afoot which affected their respective bosses
by the time mark reached home that evening the pains in his head were excruciating
he decided against telling georgina about his meeting with muldoon
he would wait for the right moment
this was it
homicide
this chapter deals with the approach of the criminal law to behaviour which causes or risks causing death
murder manslaughter and several other offences are discussed and one recurrent issue here is whether english law responds proportionately to the different degrees of culpability manifested in cases where death is caused
death and finality
for practical purposes the culpable causing of another person death may fairly be regarded as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar
there is an argument that treason is a more serious offence since it strikes at the very foundations of the state and its social organizations but treason is so rare that it is surely permissible to treat homicide as the most serious form of crime
the reason for this is not difficult to find the harm caused by many other crimes is remediable to a degree whereas the harm caused by homicide is absolutely irremediable
even in crimes of violence which leave some permanent physical disfigurement or psychological effects the victim retains his or her life and therefore the possibility of further pleasures and achievements whereas death is final
this finality makes it proper to regard death as the most serious harm that may be inflicted on another and to regard a person who chooses to inflict that harm as the most culpable of offenders in the absence of some excuse or justification
although many deaths arise from natural causes and many others from illnesses and diseases each year sees a large number of deaths caused by accidents and also a number caused by acts or omissions which amount to some form of homicide in english law
for the statistics show that there were some accidental deaths of which some occurred in the home at work and on the roads
by comparison the number of deaths recorded as criminal homicide was which includes all the murders and manslaughters
this figure is relatively small when compared with many american cities but that is no cause for satisfaction
there are still awkward questions to be confronted
for example are we satisfied that the deaths recorded as homicide are in fact more culpable than all or even most of the deaths recorded as accidents
in other words does english criminal law pick out the most heinous forms of killing as murders and manslaughters or are the boundaries frozen by tradition
another question is whether the criminal law ought not to be wider in its application to activities which carry some risk of causing death than in other spheres
thus even if it would be excessive to sweep large numbers of the deaths now recorded as accidents into the law of homicide there may be sufficient justification for creating or enforcing offences designed to ensure safe conditions of work safe goods safe buildings and so on
it was argued in chapter that the criminal law ought to spread its net wider where the potential harm is greater
it will be seen that english law does this up to a point and in the process seems to accept arguments as reasons for departing from several of the principles set out in chapter
requirements of criminal homicide
english law distinguishes between the offences of murder and manslaughter as we shall see but the two crimes do have certain common elements
it must be proved that the defendant act or omission caused the death of the victim within a year and a day
the requirements of causation in the criminal law are discussed elsewhere
the year and a day rule is a legacy of times when medical science was so rudimentary that if there was a substantial lapse of time between injury and death it was unsafe to pronounce on whether the defendant conduct or some other event caused the death
nowadays the problem is quite the reverse medical science is generally able to determine whether d conduct caused the death and innovations such as machines mean that life can be prolonged for months and years in some instances
in one recent case the victim of a stabbing died two and a half years after the incident having been kept on a machine for almost the entire time
in principle it seems unjust that a homicide conviction should not be possible in such a case if all the other elements can be established and only the year and a day rule stands in the way
but the rule was confirmed by the criminal law revision committee in on the ground that a defendant should not be left in peril of a homicide conviction indefinitely
surely prosecutorial discretion should be enough to prevent unfair convictions years after the event
the rule itself is out of accord with modern medical conditions and should be abolished
defining murder the inclusionary question
a the procedural context
if causing death is to be regarded as the most serious harm that can be inflicted it would seem to follow that the most blameworthy form of homicide should result in the highest sentences imposed by the courts
indeed many systems of criminal law impose a mandatory sentence for murder or whatever the highest form of homicide is called in that system
in some jurisdictions this is a mandatory sentence of death
in others such as those in the united kingdom it is the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment
why should this penalty be mandatory and not at the discretion of the court as in other offences
one argument in favour of the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment is that it amounts to a symbolic indication of the unique heinousness of murder
it places the offender under the state control as it were for the remainder of his or her life
this is often linked with a supposed denunciatory effect the idea that the mandatory life sentence denounces murder as emphatically as possible and with a supposed general deterrent effect in declaring that there is no mitigation of sentence available for this crime
it might also be argued that the mandatory life sentence makes a substantial contribution to public safety
none of these arguments is notably strong let alone conclusive
the mandatory penalty does indeed serve to mark out murder from other crimes but whether the definition of murder is sufficiently refined to capture the worst killings and only the worst killings remains to be discussed below
whether the life sentence is regarded as a sufficient denunciation in society depends on the public perception of what life imprisonment means if it is widely believed that it results in an average of nine years imprisonment the effect will be somewhat blunted
the same applies to the general deterrent argument its effectiveness depends on whether the penalty for murder affects the calculations of potential killers at all and if it does whether life imprisonment is seen as significantly more or less severe than the alternative of a long sentence
as for public protection this depends on executive decisions with regard to release it fails to take into account whether it is necessary for public protection to keep lifers in for so long
this brings the discussion to a crucial point what does the sentence of life imprisonment mean in practice and what would be the alternative
what it means is that the time of release from prison is determined by the home secretary on the advice of the parole board and the lord chief justice rather than by the judge at the trial
in procedural terms therefore the life sentence involves a transfer of function normally it is the judge who determines the sentence or at least its upper limit since earlier release on parole may be possible whereas a life sentence entrusts that function to the executive who must first ascertain the opinions of the lord chief justice and the trial judge
the home office is not bound by those opinions and appears to depart from them frequently
in the home secretary imposed restrictions on the release of persons serving life for murders of and terrorist killings murder during robbery and the sadistic or sexual murder of young children fixing a minimum of twenty years imprisonment for these offenders
whatever the justifications for introducing this policy it serves to underline the fact that sentencing in murder cases is enacted without each case being considered individually after hearing representations from the offender counsel and without a sentence announced in court and subject to appeal
at present the executive takes decisions to release some murderers after only a few years and to keep others in prison for extremely long periods
should those decisions not be taken by the courts in the same way as other sentencing decisions
the answer sometimes given is that murderers should be treated differently because they are particularly dangerous anyone who chooses to kill once can choose to kill again
but this argument will seem less persuasive when we have discussed cases of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility where a murder is reduced to manslaughter the judge has a wide sentencing discretion and may according to the facts of the case select a determinate prison sentence a hospital order or life imprisonment
those who kill and are convicted of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility are no less dangerous than those convicted of murder and yet the judge has sentencing discretion in one case and not in the other
considerations of this kind have led the house of lords select committee on murder and life imprisonment to recommend the abolition of the mandatory sentence for murder
in its place would be a sentencing discretion which judges would use in many cases to mark the relative heinousness of the murder by a determinate prison sentence
in cases where life imprisonment was thought to be the appropriate sentence the trial judge would still specify in open court the number of years to be spent in prison taking the gravity of the offence into account and release would be determined by a judicial tribunal
such a reform would bring improvements in natural justice without loss of public protection
b degrees of homicide
english criminal law has two degrees of homicide murder and manslaughter
many american jurisdictions have three degrees of murder murder requiring premeditation and and murder covering lesser shades of culpability
in england there has been a proposal that we should do away with all these distinctions leaving a single offence of criminal homicide
that proposal if implemented would shift almost all the in homicide cases from the trial to the sentencing stage the only issue of any consequence in most cases would be the sentence to be imposed and all the distinctions now drawn at the stage of criminal liability would be reflected in the sentence alone
the jury would have no role in most homicide cases since a plea of guilty would be the norm
contrast this with the position in jurisdictions where there are three or more degrees of homicide pleas of guilty to and murders would be less frequent since there would be the possibility of argument in court if no bargain was struck beforehand between prosecution and defence and the defence might succeed in persuading the jury to reduce the degree of the killing
moreover the borderlines between the various degrees would raise questions of law which would provide much opportunity for legal argument and for appeals
the result would be that killings were classified and labelled in a more refined way but at the cost of lengthy trials and mounting bills
that cost is not difficult to justify where capital punishment is the penalty for murder
where there is no capital punishment however the question of how many degrees of homicide it is desirable to have calls for careful weighing of the principle of fair labelling see chapter l against the cost and time arguments mobilised by the policy of efficient administration see chapter m
the structure of the english law of homicide is rather strange
although there are two offences murder and manslaughter the latter includes two distinct varieties voluntary manslaughter killings which would be murder but for the existence of defined extenuating circumstances and involuntary manslaughter killings for which there is no need to prove any awareness of the risk of death being caused but for which there is thought to be sufficient fault to justify criminal liability
the arguments therefore tend to focus on three borderline questions what is the minimum fault required for conviction of murder
what conditions are needed to reduce murder to manslaughter
and what is the minimum fault required for a conviction of manslaughter
c requirements for murder
in english criminal law there are now two alternative fault requirements for murder an intent to kill or an intent to cause grievous bodily harm
what do these requirements mean
do they extend the definition of murder too far or are they too narrow
intent to kill may be regarded as the most obvious and indisputable form of fault element for murder but to some extent that depends on the meaning of intent
this has been the subject of a number of house of lords decisions and yet the definition is still not clear and settled
probably the most accurate statement would be that a person intends to kill if it is his or her purpose to kill by the act or omission charged or if he or she foresees that death is practically certain to follow from that act or omission
in this way both purpose and foresight of practical certainty are regarded as part of the definition of intent although there are other statements suggesting that foresight of practical or virtual certainty is merely evidence from which intent may be inferred
how would this test be applied
in many cases the word intent is used without elaboration but there are some for which a full explanation of the meaning of intention is necessary
a fairly typical set of facts is provided by nedrick where d had a grudge against a woman and had threatened to burn her out
one night he went to her house poured paraffin through the and on to the front door and set it alight
one of the woman children died in the ensuing fire
when asked why he did it d replied just to wake her up and frighten her
a defence of this kind a claim that the purpose was only to frighten and not to cause harm requires the full definition to be put to the jury
the question is granted that d purpose was to frighten did he nonetheless realize that it was practically certain that his act would cause death or grievous bodily harm to someone
the jury should answer this by drawing inferences from the evidence in the case and from the surrounding circumstances
what about the alternative element in the definition an intent to cause grievous bodily harm
this has considerable practical importance since this is all that the prosecution has to prove in order to obtain a verdict of guilty of murder
it must be shown that the defendant intended which again includes both purpose and awareness of practical certainty to cause really serious injury to someone
the house of lords confirmed this rule in cunningham d struck his victim on the head a number of times with a chair causing injuries from which the victim died a week later
d maintained throughout that he had not intended to kill but there was evidence from which the jury could infer and did infer that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm
the house of lords upheld d conviction for murder an intent to cause really serious injury is sufficient for murder without any proof that the defendant intended or even contemplated the possibility that death would result
does the grievous bodily harm rule extend the definition of murder too far
if the point of distinguishing murder from manslaughter is to mark out the most heinous group of killings for the extra stigma of a murder conviction it can be argued that the grievous bodily harm rule draws the line too low
in terms of principle the rule requires justification because it departs from the principle of correspondence see chapter a namely that the fault element in a crime should relate to the consequences prohibited by that crime
by allowing an intent to cause grievous bodily harm to suffice for a murder conviction the law is violating a general principle turning the most serious of its offences into a constructive crime
why should it be necessary to construct a murder conviction out of this lesser intent
there are arguments in favour of this death is final murder is the gravest crime and there is no significant moral difference between someone who chooses to cause really serious injury and someone who sets out to kill
no one can predict whether a serious injury will result in death that may depend on the victim physique on the speed of an ambulance on the distance from the hospital and on a range of other medical and individual matters
if one person chooses to cause serious injury to another it should be presumed that he or she realizes that there is always a risk of death and such cases show a sufficiently wanton disregard for life as to warrant the label murder if death results
the which would uphold the principle of correspondence are that breach of that principle is unnecessary when the amplitude of the crime of manslaughter lies beneath murder and also that the definition of grievous bodily harm includes a number of injuries which are most unlikely to put the victim life at risk
in the leading case of cunningham lord dissenting gave the example of breaking someone arm that is a really serious injury but one which is unlikely to endanger the victim life
so in practice the grievous bodily harm rule goes further than the arguments of its protagonists would support
would it be right then to confine the fault element in murder to an intent to kill
that would have the merit of simplicity but would it strike the right note socially
there are powerful arguments in favour of saying that there are other killings where an intent to kill can not be established and yet where the moral or social culpability is equal to that in most intentional killings
of course one can not be adamant about whether they merit the label murder because that is a question of drawing the line between murder and manslaughter which is not susceptible of any precise resolution
it is hard to argue conclusively that the category of murder should be smaller or larger unless the death penalty or a mandatory life sentence follows it is a question of social judgment
let us briefly consider some of the possibilities
the fault element for many serious offences is intent or recklessness why should this not suffice for murder
the question is whether all killings in which the defendant is aware of the risk of death are sufficiently serious to warrant the term murder
one answer sometimes given is that they are not because a driver who overtakes on a bend knowingly taking the risk that there is a car travelling in the opposite direction should not be labelled a murderer if a collision and death happen to ensue
this example assumes that a sympathy for motorists with overwhelm any tendency to logical analysis
one might ask whether motorists are ever justified in knowingly taking risks with other people lives
yet if the example is modified a little so that the overtaking is on a country road at night and the risk is known to be slight it becomes questionable whether the causing of death in these circumstances should be labelled in the same way as intentional killings
this is not to suggest that motorists should be treated differently
the point is rather that even though knowingly taking risks with other people lives is usually unjustifiable taking a slight risk is less serious than intentionally causing death
in discussing the boundaries of murder we are concerned with classification not exculpation
to classify all reckless killings as murder might be too broad but the point remains that some reckless killings may be thought no less heinous than intentional killings
can a satisfactory line be drawn here
one approach would be to draw the line by reference to the degree of probability
murder is committed in those situations where d caused death by an act or omission which he knew had death as the probable or highly probable result
a version of this test of foresight of high probability is used in several other european countries it was introduced into english law by the decision in hyam v
dpp but abandoned in moloney on grounds of uncertainty
a second approach is to frame the law in such a way as to make it clear that the court should make a moral judgment on the gravity of the defendant conduct
section of the model penal code includes within murder those reckless killings which manifest extreme indifference to the value of human life
scots law treats as murder killings with wicked recklessness a phrase which directs the court attention to the circumstances of the killing
both the model penal code test and the scots test may be reduced to circularity however for when one asks how extreme or how wicked the recklessness should be the only possible answer is wicked or extreme enough to justify the stigma of a murder conviction
admittedly the model penal code does contain a list of circumstances which may amount to extreme indifference which assists the courts and increases the predictability of verdicts in a way that scots law does not but the essence of both approaches is that there is no precise way of describing those killings which are as heinous as intentional killings
their protagonists argue that the law of murder is so important socially that derogation from the principle of maximum certainty should be allowed in favour of more accurate labelling by the courts opponents argue that the principle of maximum certainty is needed here specifically to reduce the risk of verdicts based on discriminatory or irrelevant factors such as distaste for the defendant background allegiance or other activities
a third more precise formulation derives from the recommendations of the criminal law revision committee in namely that a killing should be classified as murder in those situations where there is an intention to cause serious injury coupled with awareness of the risk of death
neither an intention to cause serious injury nor recklessness as to death should be sufficient on its own but together they restrict one another producing a test which both satisfies the criterion of certainty and marks out some heinous but killings
a fourth approach adopted by english law until and still in force in many american jurisdictions is some form of rule anyone who kills during the course of a felony or more restrictively a serious crime of violence or whilst resisting arrest should be convicted of murder
thus stated there is no reference to the defendant intention or awareness of the risks the fact that d has chosen to commit rape robbery or another serious offence and has caused death thereby is held to constitute sufficient moral grounds for placing the killing in the highest category
plainly this is a form of constructive criminal liability the murder conviction is constructed out of the ingredients of a lesser offence
presumably the justification is that d has already crossed a high threshold in choosing to commit such a serious offence and should therefore be held liable for whatever consequences ensue however unforeseeable they may be
the objections would be reduced if awareness of the risk of death was also required in other words if the test were the commission of a serious offence of violence plus recklessness as to death
the effect of that test would be to pick out those reckless killings which occurred when d had already manifested substantial moral and legal culpability and to classify them as murder
four alternative approaches have been described and many others could be listed
the point is that the traditional concepts of intention and recklessness do not of themselves appear to be sufficiently well focused to mark out those killings which are the most heinous
the law must resort to some kind of moral and social evaluation of conduct if it is to identify and separate out the most heinous killings
many people might think that a person who causes death whilst using an unlawfully held firearm or explosives ought to be convicted of murder because there is generally speaking no excuse for using such dangerous equipment
some of the people thus covered would be armed robbers others would be terrorists
the armed robber might say that he had no intention of using the firearm that he carried it with him simply to frighten the victim and that it went off accidentally if the jury believes that should he be convicted of murder

francesca simon describes some of the pitfalls and how to avoid them
by francesca simon
debbie adams had to let her east end terrace house in london in a hurry when her husband was to ireland with two months notice
she went to a local letting agency landlords of roman road bethnal green london who found a tenant that day
she also employed landlords to manage the let
as is common practice landlords kept the tenant deposit of and told debbie they would take their entire fee of up front so she expected no rent for the first month
but july also passed without debbie receiving any money
i phoned and said where the money and was told there were problems with the who would be coming in to sort it out says debbie
but nothing happened and i never heard from them
she repeatedly phoned landlords but was either unable to get an answer or told that manager howard keizner was unavailable
finally after the third month passed with no rent received debbie phoned the tenants asked them to pay her directly and sent landlords a letter which was returned and finally one by ordinary post stating that landlords were no longer employed as the managing agents
because they had done any management debbie felt landlords were entitled only to the per cent fee and therefore owed her months rent plus the deposit
in december she sued
landlords did acknowledge the writ so in january debbie solicitor requested a judgment in default for the full amount plus interest and court fees a total of
just before the court was due to hear the request her solicitor received a cheque for
they had paid the interest and court fees but we got back every single penny they owed
we were lucky says debbie adams
howard keizner of landlords said there were a lot of complications with this particular letting and management
but he declined further comment
last week he promised to supply us with a written explanation of the way his company had treated debbie but it never arrived
yusuf and shabira gulamali were less fortunate
they lost over dealing with two letting agencies which closed down without paying them the rent and tenants deposit owed on their wembley flat
they hired the first agent digs of oxford street to manage as well as to let their flat
the gulamalis received their rent for the first three months then nothing for four months and were told the computer was broken the accounts were being moved the cheque was in the post and so on
after four months they closed down owing us says shabira
together with some other clients we took the owner to court but he escaped to spain
the second time round they dealt with and lettings in london who they instructed just to find a tenant
the gulamalis never received the agreement form the tenants deposit or the first month rent
finally we went to the office and they gave us a cheque which bounced
the offices of r and lettings are now up for sale
anyone can set up a letting agency says david galsworthy vice president of the national association of estate agents
they come and go so it pays to deal with a member of a professional body such as the naea the royal institute of chartered surveyors or the incorporated society of valuers and auctioneers
in case of a dispute you can complain to the professional body and members are bonded which means that deposits and rent are covered in case of fraud or dishonesty
if you are thinking of letting your property the following points will help to safeguard your interests
ask any agency you are considering using if they are a member of one of the above professional associations
if in doubt ask to see proof of their membership
if in addition to finding a tenant the agency is managing the let you should be paid every month less a fee of between two and four weeks rent
the agency will keep the tenant deposit until the tenant leaves
if the letting agent is not managing the flat the tenant deposit should be given to the owner immediately
expect to pay a management fee of up to per cent
some agencies deduct it every month others want it all up front so shop around
if the owner is abroad the agent will also collect tax at the standard rate of per cent which will be deducted from your monthly rent cheque
letting agencies should never charge tenants a finder fee although according to galsworthy many agencies do
it not ethical as they are acting for the landlord he says
the naea has members of which also do letting and management
but galsworthy believes there is a clear need for the licensing of all letting agents
we want everyone to be licensed but the government did think it necessary
section of the estate agents act dealing with bonding licensing and standards of competency has not been brought in
but we must have a common code and we must have licensing he said
until then owners and tenants beware
travel copse and robbers christopher somerville sees how woodland has usurped the ancient cattle thieves of the cheviot hills
by christopher somerville
when a charlton chief sat down to dinner in times gone by and found a spur on the table where his meal should have been he knew the cupboard was bare once more
his wife was telling him to saddle up and steal a fresh batch of cattle from his neighbour herds
the families of north tynedale in westernmost northumberland charltons and robsons milburns and dodds were never slow to lay hands on each other property in the lawless old days
here where the scottish border ran across the cheviot hills far from civilisation reiving or was a way of life
remoteness is still the keynote of this region but a charlton reiving party would be hard put to it these days to work up a good gallop along the upper reaches of the north tyne river
since the western fringes of the cheviots have been planted with square miles of conifers while in their depths sprawl the seven miles of the kielder water reservoir europe largest lake
i found it hard to picture what kind of landscape those statistics might have shaped until i opened the ordnance survey map to find half of it coloured green with a great blue stain in the centre
kielder water is beautiful and the kielder trees formidably impressive in their domination of the hills
but by the time i had turned off the road from bellingham at kielder village and driven up the bumpy forest drive to east kielder farm i was longing for the sight of something other than water and trees
relief was at hand
the farm stands on a spur of moorland on the northern edge of the forest and within minutes i had turned my back on the corduroy battalions of trees and was striding under a still cloudy sky over tussocks of rush and coarse grass with my face to the long bare shoulders of open hillside that flank the winding shallows of the east kielder burn
the footpath that runs with the burn is not one of those carefully waymarked and leafleted by the forestry commission
there are few attractions for the kielder tourist here
the burn threads a wild and inhospitable crevice of the hills where the wind blows cold and the sense of isolation grows with each lonely mile
walking here you leave the century behind on the outskirts of the forest and enter the reconstructed emptiness in which the reivers and raiders of the past could operate unhindered
i squelched across tiny burns running in black channels of peat and stood looking down from the hillside on to the grey roofs of scaup farm
the hollow barking of a dog came from one of the stone sheds but there was no sign of life around the buildings
scaup must be just about the loneliest farm in england tucked down in the shelter of the hills with kielder forest dark mass blocking its southward view and the narrowing valley of the burn filling half the sky to the north
the east kielder burn divides here into scaup burn and white kielder burn
i dropped down the hill to ford white kielder upstream of the ruined farmstead of kielder head where a line of stunted alders shaggy with lichen leaned over their leafless reflections in the water
spring comes late to this windbitten and valley
but there were lambs in the sheep pens of scaup and a cheery hello now from the farmer and his wife tending them
those were the last human voices i heard all day
lives up here in the cleft of the white kielder burn
the rough land is altogether too harsh and unyielding giving sustenance only to sheep and to the conifers high on the flanks of east kielder moor and grey mares knowe immense sweeps of hillside to right and left of the valley
the footpath on the left bank of the burn was little better than a sheep track but there were clues to its former importance as a droving road over the hills to byrness in redesdale
large boulders stood out beside the path as grey blobs in the featureless sheets of pale grass and flat stones had been placed as bridges across the burns their backs hollowed by the tread of feet through the centuries
following these now disregarded signs of past activity along the old path i traversed the hillside and came down to a crumbling stone sheepfold with the roofless remains of a shepherd hut built into one wall
the tiny single room was jammed with the mossy timbers of disused sheep pens but the little iron fire grate that once warmed the hardy men who worked here was still set in the foot of the hut tottering gable end and the massive stone lintel had not yet fallen from its place above the doorway
a dipper flew up from the burn as i emerged from the hut his white breast flashing as he darted downstream
somewhere ahead in the crags of kielderhead moor a hawk was whistling a piercing sound in the lonely valley overlain for a few moments by the snarl of a jet
that jarring manifestation of furious technology seemed as remote and ridiculous as a dream as silence settled down on kielderhead and the hawk whistle came down from the moors
the valley of the white kielder burn steepened again as i trudged north its curves tightening
now the path ran through heather high above the burn past circular sheepfolds long disused and over the stony beds of side streams where the grass hung smooth and inviting concealing drops
a mile above the shepherd hut the hillsides ceased their upward rolling and curved together to form a valley of slopes five miles from the nearest tarmac road hidden deep in the folds of the moors
the old drover road turned aside here and climbed under the rock faces of white crags to continue its lonely course over girdle fell and down into redesdale
i could have gone with it giving myself four blissful miles of upland walking followed by as many miserable hours of fruitless searching for return transport to east kielder farm
instead i lay back in the heather and savoured the trickle of the burn and the crisp smell of ground
not a sign of spring had yet penetrated this secret valley but another month would put that right
there were five miles of return tramping to face but they too could wait awhile
election and what can the politicians do for meadowell
probably nothing at all
joyriding riots propelled tyneside meadowell estate to national prominence last september
has the election campaign penetrated its grim streets
by martyn harris
at the centre on south meadowell labour candidate paddy cosgrove has dropped in to meet the people mostly fat ladies in shellsuits with laps full of chips
you all know me says paddy and a fat lady with good timing says i do know you
never seen you in me life
on the floor a toddler peels more chips from a congealed bluish mass and feeds them to a baby
another digs the cream from the centre of a pink fancy and smears it in his hair
paddy cosgrove councillor and barrister in candidates pinstripes sits tensely on the edge of his plastic chair
i a regular visitor to this estate
who does he say he is says a second fat lady
that liberal paddy ashgrove
he better looking on tv
he only come because the press are here says the first fat lady
and paddy cosgrove blushes
political consciousness is low on the meadowell estate
turnout at the last election was around per cent and with the thinning of the electoral roll brought by the poll tax will be even lower this time
they are mostly labour voters but several confuse their labour candidate with the leader of the liberal democrats
very few know their mp is a conservative and hardly anyone that his name is neville trotter defender of a slender majority
by most measures meadowell is the worst council estate in britain and probably the most notorious since the riots last september which followed the deaths of joyriders colin atkins and dale robson in a police chase
in fact meadowell is an elastoplast name like sizewell invented in the to disguise what was already a running sore
when built in it was the ridges which is still what they call it locally a slum clearance project on the north bank of the tyne miles east of newcastle
its first inhabitants were shipyard and fishquay workers from the riverside towns of north shields and wallsend who moved happily from their tumbledown terraces to these fine new houses with inside toilets and gardens
many like ronnie collyer a retired shipyard worker still live here and are still proud of the place
all the trouble says ronnie is down to a few families who doa keep their young uns in order
and then the media coom down and blow everything up
he has polished shoes a close shave and too much pride for a free drink
it a canny place the ridges with plenty of good folk
but something was wrong from the start
some say it was the importing of whole streets of fighting families from the fishquays with their dockland diversions of prostitution and handling
others say it was the shortage of pubs shops churches transport and police stations
by the the ridges was the criminal ghetto of newcastle and by the a costly council manicure job had turned it into a zone
paths and boundaries vanished allowing the tides of street life to wash right up to the doorsteps
joyriders used front lawns to practise their handbrake turns
car theft became so common that private cars virtually disappeared from the area
shops like greengrocers and chippies with pitiful cash takings were routinely subjected to armed robberies with shotguns balaclavas the whole bit
when i ask the fat ladies at the centre what is the one thing that would do most to improve the estate they say get rid of the kids and they are only half joking
the age structure of meadowell means it is awash with teenagers whose only pastimes are having babies and
do your husbands come here
i ask and they all laugh
the men are all useless sitting indoors if there trouble in the street
it women have to go out and deal with it
by the time of the riots a quarter of all houses on the estate were boarded up and burned out by infant petrol bombers
unemployment was per cent on some streets
in meadowell primary which has children every one was receiving a clothing grant
the area had effectively been abandoned by the authorities a fact which became clear during the riot itself when police waited five hours to enter the estate and put down the disturbances
and there were never more than a few dozen ringleaders bob mather a local butcher tells me
i was stood outside me shop all night and most were no more than kids
eight months on and little has changed if anything it is rather worse
unemployment is up another per cent more houses and shops are boarded up burglaries and joyriding continue and if there is less it is only because or so of the hardest cases are still behind bars
a food which tried to replace the shops has been closed after several and even the centre is burgled weekly according to project worker sheila auld
there is a new phone box ripped from the wall and lying on the floor of her office to prove it
meadowell has even discovered a new martyr in the shape of one willy hunter a local hard nut awaiting trial for murder and allegedly the victim of a police
free willy hunter say the graffiti next to the old fading graffiti for dale robson and colin atkins
my friend kevin muscleman and minicab driver says the lads would be out rioting for willy now if it was tipping down with rain the whole time
a few things have been achieved i suppose
there are some posh flats going up at neighbouring royal quays which will provide building jobs it sun city in the middle of bantustan a labour councillor said to me
the cheviot housing association is slowly taking over property in south meadowell
a new police station is to be built
the government sponsored meadowell initiative makes noises in the north of the estate but does pitifully little painfully slowly
north tyneside council says it is too starved of funds by central government to do much
tory ministers like michael heseltine who visited meadowell last november say the cash shortages are due to council profligacy and bad management
mp neville trotter is a tory with vowels who has little appeal to the people of meadowell and a dwindling appeal in the suburbs where unemployment is also climbing
paddy cosgrove his likely replacement is a council hack of years standing and ideal backbench fodder though it is hard to imagine him leading a crusade for meadowell
when i ask the people of the estate what they want from this election some say they want cheviot to rebuild it and others that it would be better grassed over
some say they should bring back hanging others say it is the politicians they should hang but most say there is nothing anybody can do at all

con maj
sit they said but he would this week john major began to appear on a different kind of box
in the last of his series on the leaders frank johnson reports
by frank johnson
we were in the west country
the prime minister was on his soapbox
just up the road at langport in somerset was the birthplace of walter bagehot although as he directed his microphone at liberal democrat hecklers john major had other things on his mind
the relevance is that bagehot was the first political commentator
the travelling chaos of a modern party leader election entourage had carried major within a few miles of the home of the founder of the profession a few of whose more troublesome contemporary practitioners are said to have caused him much irritation over the months of his premiership
a liberal
he admitted to being a liberal
major cried jabbing a finger in the direction of one heckler
the man had a liberal democrat rosette pinned to his cap
he was also carrying an orange poster on a pole urging a vote for the local liberal democrat candidate
therefore the admission which the prime minister wrung from him could hardly be said to have been grudging
but like all the best soapbox orators major had prepared his repartee in advance
i knew there was one here he continued meaning liberal democrats
there were in fact about a score
then came the passage which appeared on the television news that evening and in the papers the next day about the liberal democrats being the trojan horse that would let labour in
there were also some lines intended for local consumption higher petrol prices from the liberal democrats that not gon na help a rural area
what would bagehot have made of him
like the heckler he was a liberal
there the similarity ends since judging from his writings bagehot was a roaring snob whereas judging from his heckles the heckler was not
more to the point it was bagehot who said a constitutional statesman is in general a man of common opinions and uncommon abilities
the statesman to whom he was referring was peel
a political commentator of our own day paul johnson quoted it not long after major became prime minister to suggest that it was also true of him
but is it still
b agehot phrase comes in a passage in which he appears to propound the dispiriting theory that a politician if he wants to get anywhere must appeal to the average man
the average man is a cool common person with a considerate air with figures in his mind with his own business to attend to with a set of ordinary opinions arising from and suited to ordinary life
he ca bear novelty or originalities
original theories give trouble
bagehot goes on to say of peel from a certain peculiarity of intellect and fortune he was never in advance of his time
of almost all the great measures with which his name is associated he attained great eminence as an opponent before he attained even greater eminence as their advocate
that last sentence has more to do with kinnock than with major
it is also a warning to all hack tories who think that it is a telling blow against kinnock to keep on pointing out that he has reversed his opinions about unilateral nuclear disarmament british membership of the ec or anything else
but the most striking thing about bagehot essay on peel in the light of the last full week of this election campaign is that it simply does not apply to major at all
common opinions were what got major into difficulties in the first place
between his becoming prime minister and his party fall in the polls about days ago major did nearly everthing that common opinion wanted him to do
this was true of what he did about both high policy and low politics
for example on high policy common opinion said that there was nothing for it but to stay in the erm
he stayed in and the recession worsened
in low politics common opinion no less common for being expensively hired by conservative central office encouraged him in the belief that he should fight much of the election sitting down
he did so and he looked like the questioner in the studio audience rather than the answerer
the result was wobbly week the second week of the campaign
but last saturday major climbed on to that soapbox in luton
until then he had been that most inhuman of creatures the public figure described by others as very human
now he really was human unscripted jokey even a bit passionate
the jubilant word from kinnock camp was that major was behaving more like an opposition leader than a prime minister
but there seemed nothing wrong with the head of government appearing to be the challenger on the hustings
president truman did so in a campaign which expected him to win and he won
it is justified if the head of government is challenging something powerful
kinnock complains of the alleged power of the tory tabloid press but he has powers on his side too
ninety per cent of his party cash comes from the unions which will expect a return
the british people have in the past found them rather more powerful than the corporations which are popularly supposed to finance the conservative party
then there are all those schoolteachers dons television producers writers on arts pages and members of the agitating classes who want a labour win in order to impose political correctness
that is to say they will have what the jesuits once attached such importance to power over young or impressionable minds
as the week went by major rejected common opinion about two other large subjects proportional representation and scottish devolution
he hardened his opposition to both despite the fact that his own party chairman had once favoured the first and vocal forces within his scottish party were in support of the second
e ven at this late hour psephology demographics and luck suggest that the tories could still emerge as the biggest single party in a hung parliament
is it possible that major would rather go into opposition with the dangers that would mean for his continued leadership of the conservative party than offer pr and scottish devolution to the liberal democrats
if so we are dealing with a more quixotic romantic or principled figure than some of us used to think
once that soapbox came out major campaigned as if he would now do and say what he really thought
was it too late
from central office and from around his entourage came the unmistakable signs of friends preparing to detach themselves from blame for defeat
and then on thursday morning when major election tour reached the daily mail ideal home exhibition sir david english the paper editor was not there to greet him
a junior spin doctor is reported to have muttered though admittedly out of my earshot we been snubbed
not sir david
some in the profession of political commentating would opt for bagehot as their formative influence but mine has long been sir david a founder of biased tory journalism
his lack of humbug about political balance has always made him more honest than all the employees of bbc current affairs awaiting with glee the kinnock years
eventually sir david office issued a statement about the prime minister
normally a prime minister office would issue a statement about an editor
but major makes a point of not being grand and with sir david it is the other way about
sir david english was not informed of the visit and in consequence had no plans to attend the ideal home exhibition that day the official statement announced
faith in sir david leadership was restored
scientists click over a way to save dolphins
by greg neale environment correspondent
hundreds of thousands of dolphins could be saved from death thanks to pioneering work by british scientists
they believe they have found a cheap practical means of preventing dolphins entangling themselves in monofilament drift fishing nets the walls of death believed to be responsible for killing large numbers of dolphins off cornwall this year
but their work is hampered by lack of money
so far they have received nothing from the government little ec assistance and are running out of funds donated by individuals and industry
the researchers headed by dr margaret klinowska a cambridge biologist and david goodson an expert on acoustic engineering at loughborough university say new data shows that plastic sound reflectors to fishing nets can warn dolphins of hazards
data to be published shortly draws on experiments including observations of freddy the dolphin that has been living off the northumbrian coast for four years
using equipment donated by racal the scientists have analysed recordings of the clicking dolphins make while hunting
observations of freddy led them to conclude that dolphins use sonar while hunting
they emit an intense click or pulse of sound
echoes of the signal alert them to possible prey at ranges up to metres in shallow waters
mr goodson who became interested in the sonar capacity of dolphins after hearing one while swimming off the welsh coast has experimented with various shapes of sound reflectors
the most promising is eliptical about long
the theory is that its internal air pocket will bounce back the dolphin sonar signal regardless of the direction of approach
last autumn dr klinowska mr goodson and their team put the theories into practice
in the moray firth they placed a headline barrier from which they had suspended reflectors at intervals
the movement of dolphins around the barrier was observed using electronic equipment to monitor sonar activity
the results exceeded our expectations said mr goodson
dolphins swimming near the barrier altered their behaviour to avoid it the result the scientists believe of them detecting sonar echoes from the reflectors
dr klinowska said that although it was necessary to be cautious about the findings a combination of reflector devices and some modification of fishing gear might reduce deaths
but the moray firth experiments were only possible after the naturalist dr david bellamy helped secure a donation from the wholesale society
our work is being delayed simply through the lack of funding said dr klinowska
the scientists hope to raise through an appeal by windsor safari park
donations can be made to the dolphin research project windsor safari park windsor berkshire
the arts courtroom drama in the case of the bogus picassos
by michael pye
suppose you have a print by picasso dali miro or chagall or sold one in the past few years you have a special interest in a brooklyn courtroom this week

she pleads not guilty
the feds claim to have seized prints at the family firm known with a nice irony as original artworks ltd
they say there were blank sheets bearing dali signature alongside fake miros and fake chagalls
the picassos according to sotheby valuer were sloppy

the st petersburg national opera the national chaliapin company is in new york for the first time

both are presenting the great russian warhorses boris godunov and the queen of spades
both companies expected to bring the bass vladimir ognovenko to sing boris and the irina bogatcheva
russian singers do spend their lives with one company any more
but kirov management satra arts international felt badly upstaged
under pressure from satra kirov told singers to choose between the companies
the national boris godunov was built around ognovenko he had to stay home
the mezzo irina bogatcheva wife of the national artistic director stanislav gaudassinksy agreed to limit her roles
but that was enough
for daring to come at all she was cut from the kirov team
she went home in tears at the weekend
but her husband did have consolation on saturday as we talked over scotch and peking duck the sound of american cheers for his robust version of boris godunov

the arts in the name of charity
by lewis jones
charity is a divine attribute but we are enjoined to give forgetfully lest we fall into the absurd error of mistaking ourselves for gods
the perils of ignoring this advice were well illustrated by angel of bengal the true stories documentary by anna raphael which was by turns hilarious and enraging
the angel in question was an american woman who calls herself rytasha
apart from a particularly and alarming contact lenses rytasha is rather beautiful and in the when she went by the name of ricki she was a successful model she began life as maxine shenkman
an earlier film by raphael the persuaders charted the transformation of ricki into rytasha which occurred at the hare krishna temple in london and her uneasy relationship with her guru there
it would have been interesting to have seen the two films together
since rytasha has broken awayfrom her guru and set up on her own with a charity called food relief international which raises money from the fiercely competitive matrons of palm beach and distributes it to the starving people of bangladesh
she adaws bangladesh gushed rytasha mother the fiercest matron of them all rejoicing in the improbable title of baroness thea von theilheimer shenkman
she went on to list her daughter achievements she put in an irritation system
with no trace of a smile or a blush the baroness quickly corrected herself an irrigation system but the slip was a telling one and i sure they would have appreciated it in bangladesh
the villagers of ramsala recipients of the palm beach dollars explained to the cameras that they desperately needed a clinic
we told her that a mud hut would do but she said no she build something pukka
a pukka building was duly erected but its medical function has somehow been indefinitely postponed
it is devoted instead to the worship of the charitable rytasha who is not content simply to hand over the cash but insists in an unfortunate hangover from her hare krishna days on posturing as a spiritual master
the villagers seemed unimpressed but were given no choice in the matter
nor could the vaunted irrigation scheme be described as an unqualified success
the money ran out before the scheme completion and the villagers found themselves obliged to borrow the rest
they begged rytasha for reimbursement but none was forthcoming and for the want of a few hundred pounds the village lost its crop for the year
now what are we supposed to do asked one of them
are we to sell our cattle or our land
the most irritating thing about rytasha and there were many was that though she does not speak their language she presumes to teach them a spurious form of their own religion
one thing we do need in this subcontinent professor rokeya kabeer observed is spiritual guidance we have gurus a dime a dozen
they are far too civilised for that sort of thing in bangladesh but i kept thinking wistfully of eliot lines in sweeney agonistes about a nice little white little missionary stew
city lloyd members fail in bid to protect cash fund
by karen cooper
more than lloyd of london members on syndicates managed by the gooda walker agency have failed in their legal attempt to prevent lloyd and members agents from drawing down their funds
michael freeman the solicitor who advised the members on court action said yesterday this will cause the most dreadful hardship
there is going to be a great deal of pain in the market place now
in an earlier than expected commercial court judgment mr justice saville found that the members had not produced enough evidence of irregularities in the lmx spiral which sends catastrophe risks swirling round the market to stop the usual process of calling on cash deposits to make good syndicate losses
however he suggested there was perhaps a need to look into the system more closely
costs were awarded to the members agents but not to lloyd
the members many of whom are unable to fulfil the latest cash call due on march to cover losses on syndicates were seeking an interim injunction to stop members agents and lloyd dipping into their security
they were challenging the pay now sue later principle at lloyd which says names should pay cash calls first and fight them later
lloyd chairman david coleridge welcomed the judgment
we have every sympathy with those who have made substantial underwriting losses in recent years but lloyd owes its first duty to policyholders with valid claims which must be met he said
mr freeman said an appeal was most unlikely because we are not going to get any more evidence
earlier this month preliminary findings from an investigation by kenneth randall found that the gooda walker agency may have overstated its syndicates profits between and through the use of time and distance policies about which it had failed to inform its auditors in at least one syndicate
peter nutting who led the association of outhwaite members to a succesful settlement said he sympathised with gooda walker names but if the names were not going to pay these calls who did they think was going to pay them
meanwhile members who were not part of the outhwaite settlement have voted to press their claims for compensation through the outhwaite names association
it plans to issue a protective writ but is hoping to achieve a settlement
the nhs is not for sale virginia bottomley talks to george jones in her first interview since joining the cabinet
by george jones
the new health secretary mrs virginia bottomley set herself an ambitious target yesterday to take the politics out of the national health service
but her desire to provide a period of stability for nearly one million people employed by the nhs is coupled with a fierce determination to maintain the momentum of reform with the overwhelming majority of hospitals becoming trusts by the
labour sought to turn the general election into a referendum on the nhs asking voters for a mandate to reverse the changes
mrs bottomley is convinced the tory victory provides the opportunity to entrench the reforms and to give doctors nurses and managers the confidence to make them work
in her first full interview since being appointed health secretary she said the election result and mr major unequivocal commitment to the nhs had finally nailed the lie about privatisation of health care
the nhs is not for profit
it is not for sale
it will continue to be true to its founding principles available to all and free at the point of delivery she said
she recalled a promise made by mr major when he became prime minister that he would work for a nation at ease with itself
i want to see a health service at ease with itself optimistic and confident about its essential work
health is something which touches every individual and family in the country she said
but there must be changes
an organisation that does change fossilises
health needs to develop and alter
by next year she is confident that two thirds of hospitals will have become trusts within the nhs
she pledged that the government would safeguard those that did not opt for trust status but she expected this to be a minority
the government will also encourage more family doctors to hold budgets to buy services for patients and is looking at ways to enable smaller practices to team up to secure the advantages of fund holding
the election result has given the conservatives five years in which to press ahead with the changes
most people are likely to judge the reforms on how long they have to wait for treatment the issue behind the jennifer ear controversy during the election campaign
mrs bottomley stressed her commitment to the patient charter which has already eliminated almost all waits of more than two years for nhs operations
the next step is to ensure that from march no one should have to wait more than months for a hip or knee replacement or a cataract operation
a national standard will also be set for outpatient waiting times
mrs bottomley first big test as health secretary will come this summer with the annual public spending round which will be conducted against a background of concern over high government borrowing and pressure from the tory right for public spending cuts
the conservative manifesto contained a commitment to increase year by year the level of real resources committed to the nhs though it put no figure on the extra money to be allocated
mrs bottomley representing caring conservatism will face mr michael portillo the new treasury chief secretary who is equally keen to establish his credentials by demonstrating he can keep keep a tight grip on the public purse strings
she acknowledged that there could be difficult times ahead
it will always be the case that the holder of my office will need to fight the corner of the health service and there will always inevitably be more than we can do
but she stressed there would be no in the search for greater efficiency
as well as fighting for more money her task was to ensure that every last pound was spent as effectively as it could be
her priorities include giving more encouragement to medical research emphasis on preventive health to make the nhs a health as well as a sickness service with the publication shortly of new national targets for reducing deaths from heart disease and cancers and pressing ahead with care in the community
as a former psychiatric social worker mrs bottomley is determined to improve standards of care for mentally ill and handicapped people
it is not acceptable to have people who require a home confined to institutions when they could be in more domestic settings
that is a real challenge she said
mrs bottomley rise to the top has been swift with only four years between her first ministerial post and a seat at the cabinet table
but she bridles at suggestions that the inclusion of two women mrs gillian shephard at the department of employment and herself has excluded more able men from the cabinet
prime ministers always have to consider balance in the cabinet and at least we now have the same number of women as old etonians in john major team she said
a paradigm of probation practice some sobering thoughts singer
lawrence singer is an assistant chief probation officer with merseyside probation service
beforehand he worked as a probation officer for berkshire probation service and later as a research officer for somerset probation service where he undertook the research reported here
the paradigm which is described originates from doctoral research into generic probation practice and has been presented in a book adult probation and juvenile supervision beyond the dilemma gower
summary
the government white paper crime justice and protecting the public proposes a radical change for probation practice
henceforth probation work will no longer be an alternative to punishment but an alternative form of punishment
this article challenges the conceptual and practical appropriateness of applying the notion of punishment to the probation context
probation officers it is argued are concerned with establishing rules for probationers and not inflicting pain on them
an alternative paradigm of probation practice is described
the paradigm is based on the joint supervisory aims of support and surveillance which are implemented through the methods of counselling assisting directing and monitoring
to illustrate the paradigm reference is made to an alcohol education course developed for offenders in trouble through drink
the efficacy of the alcohol project and the paradigm is demonstrated by the results reported from a three year evaluation study covering offenders
the article concludes with an affirmation of the disciplined but character of current probation work and argues that to successfully protect the public and reintegrate offenders into the community the probation officer employment of established social work knowledge skills and values is a strength not a weakness
the aim of this article is to challenge the assertion contained in the white paper crime justice and protecting the public home office that probation practice can be conceived of as a form of punishment in the community
issue will be taken with the appropriateness of applying the concept of punishment to the probation context through reference to a demanding and successful probation project concerned with offenders in trouble through drink
in describing the project a model for understanding probation practice will be developed
this paradigm will provide a framework for contrasting the efficacy of current practice with future plans inappropriately to transform probation work into a new approach to punishment in the community para
the punitive approach anticipated for the probation service in the white paper is underpinned by a definition of punishment that resides in the restrictions on liberty and in the enforcement of the orders
the white paper goes on to emphasize it is the loss of liberty involved in carrying out the terms of the order rather than the activities carried out during the order which is the punishment para
notwithstanding the popular appeal and political capital to be derived from such a statement this definition is nevertheless at variance with the traditional understanding of the meaning of punishment
discourses on punishment and dictionary definitions of the term clearly specify the central feature of punishment as being the infliction of pain rather than the loss of liberty per se hudson
the conceptual and practical implications of this discrepancy will be examined in the third and final section of this article
beforehand however consideration will be given first to the probation project and second to its evaluation
in these sections punishment will be understood to mean the infliction of pain and the review of the project will seek to demonstrate that the probation practice described is not only more demanding but also more effective than this traditional understanding of punishment
at a time when the home secretary is inviting the probation service to move centre stage in the criminal justice system nacro it may seem misguided and unnecessarily pedantic to take issue with the white paper notion of punishment
punishment is just a word after all nothing more than convenient political rhetoric meriting only from probation managers and practitioners poised at the window of opportunity
however this fails to acknowledge a fundamental axiom of social work practice namely that language not only reflects but also shapes social reality
as davies has pointed out speech is the basic tool of the social worker
what we say influences what we think and in turn what we do
if punishment is assimilated into the probation glossary it will inevitably influence the sort of practice the service undertakes
in the sections to follow the stark question is therefore put is the probation service in the business of inflicting pain and the answer which unfolds may be summarized no because it neither aspires nor wishes to
the project more demanding than punishment
government concern about the problem of offending is as old as the probation service
indeed as bochel has shown the establishment of a probation service in england and wales was inextricably linked with work undertaken with offenders in trouble through drink
almost a century later the new approach to punishment in the community outlined by the white paper once again presents alcohol misuse as a key problem requiring intervention
alcohol the white paper states is implicated in a wide variety of crimes drunken driving offences of public disorder and domestic violence para
in describing its vision of effective supervision the white paper goes on to note
offenders take part in alcohol education programmes so that they can learn to drink sensibly
they learn about the relative strength of different drinks the amount which is safe to consume and the pitfalls to avoid competitive drinking and buying rounds para
as a summary of alcohol education programmes this is something of a simplification
however it does provide a useful introduction to the origins of the alcohol education course reported here
furthermore it highlights the suitability of referring to this type of project for testing out the appropriateness of applying the notion of punishment to probation practice
in the management of somerset probation service was faced with the fact that nearly one in three of the offenders supervised in their area were either known to be or suspected of misusing alcohol singer
aware of practitioners frustration in not being able to work effectively with these problematic clients probation management in partnership with the voluntary sector determined to develop an alcohol education course aec
by when social inquiry report monitoring information covering offenders indicated that the problem of offending was virtually as great for as for clients that is alcohol was cited as a problem in per cent of cases a specialist project worker had been appointed
towards the end of an aec was launched and has been running ever since
the aim of the course is to educate offenders about alcohol to facilitate a lasting change in their subsequent use of this drug
this aim is underpinned by three interrelated objectives and it is not without significance how they complement and serve to implement the white paper own trinity of aims of supervision that is protection of the public prevention of reoffending and successful reintegration of the offender in the community para
these were

to increase knowledge about alcohol so that future alcohol use can be more informed and therefore more prudent

to instil or reinforce responsible drinking attitudes and behaviour

to encourage the maintenance of or where appropriate a reduction to a personally and socially safe level of alcohol unit intake
to meet these objectives the aec has a structured programme involving group and individual contact that is six group sessions sandwiched between interviews held immediately before and after the group
the initial meeting held with one of the two group leaders serves to clarify what participants can expect from the course and what is expected of them
a standard contract which covers conditions of attendance and an agreement to complete various assignments between group sessions is signed by each participant
the final interview entails a personalized review of the course as well as the formulation of a plan to be undertaken with the offender supervising officer
the course employs a variety of materials and techniques including the use of checklists magazine and newspaper clippings quizzes videos brainstorm exercises discussions drink diaries and role plays menary
the aec is primarily intended for young adults subject to a probation order with a special condition of attendance schedule ii criminal justice act and reflects the fact that most somerset offenders in trouble through drink commit serious offences possess a substantial number of previous convictions
in short they are seriously at risk of committing further offences and becoming trapped in the revolving door of custody
the development of the somerset aec both accords with and constitutes a practical example of the home office recent guidance to sentencers
in recent years the probation service has devoted increasing resources to supervising the more serious and persistent offenders
probation orders which are combined with constructive disciplined and effective programmes of supervision are increasingly being used for offenders who stand to receive custodial sentences
from the description of the aec already given the demanding and disciplined nature of the course can be appreciated
however the course is not punitive it is not concerned with the infliction of pain
instead it is concerned with the establishment of rules
this is plainly evident from the section of the contract signed by each participant where what is expected of them is spelt out
you will be expected to keep a drink diary throughout the course and make attempts at reducing the amount you drink if it is greater than accepted healthy drinking levels
you must be willing to be helped and help others your experiences will be useful to other group members
you must attend sessions these will consist of an introductory session six group sessions and a final assessment interview
you must not drink before the session
you must be on time lateness will count as an absence
unlike the prison inmate aec participants can not sit back and passively do their time
probation practice is not however solely concerned with the establishment of rules
as has been demonstrated elsewhere with regard to the generic probation setting singer the supervision of offenders involves two overarching aims namely support and surveillance
support refers to anything which is said or done to help the offender solve or mitigate their personal or social problems surveillance to anything which is said or done to induce the offender to conform to socially acceptable standards of behaviour
these aims are implemented through the practice of four distinguishable but related methods
in terms of support there is counselling and assisting in terms of surveillance there is directing and monitoring
each of these four methods are employed during the eight sessions
although summarized as an alcohol education course the sessions are not just concerned with giving information but also with enabling participants to make practical use of it
in the first group session the counselling method is registered in the course tutor notes menary by the explanation this session aims to get participants to consider the subject of alcohol in ways they had not thought of in the past
during this session the importance of monitoring is also emphasized
drinks exercises introduce the notion of measurement concentration of alcohol content information which will be necessary to carry out the recording of alcohol consumption throughout the duration of the course
in the fifth group session entitled focus on the individual the counselling and the monitoring combine with the directing and assisting methods
at the start of the session the tutor notes make clear that directing extends beyond enforcing the conditions of attendance
this session allows for an in depth examination of the drinking diaries over the last five weeks identifying the risky circumstances or situations
the aim at the end of the session is to encourage participants to make rules for their future drinking which will lead to a lessening of identified problems
similarly the assisting extends beyond simply providing handouts of useful information
it is important that participants are provided with the skills to reduce their drinking levels or handle more effectively pub centred problems
the use of role play incorporating previously discussed difficulties homework assignment session in real or set up situations provides an opportunity for testing these skills
probably the best illustration of the assisting method in action during the course comes in the fifth session when somerset practitioners take the logic of working with the problem in the community to its ultimate conclusion
in the second half of the session course leaders sponsor participants to an evening at the pub for the purpose of practising drinking skills and purchasing drinks
the counselling assisting directing and monitoring on the aec give substance to the aims of support and surveillance and provide the basis for establishing a model of probation practice
punishment has no place in this model
instead the aec can best be understood as an example of a paradigm of probation practice
twenty years ago the advisory council on the penal system observed that notions of punitiveness do not accord with the british concept of probation as an alternative to rather than a suspension of punishment quoted in bochel
twenty years later the aec demonstrates that this remains no less true now than it was then
but does the aec work
bringing fossils back to life
in this chapter some of the ways in which palaeontologists determine the way fossil animals lived are described reanimating the dead fragments to build up a living creature
since popular ideas of life in the past are often founded on vividly coloured reconstructions of the world in the jurassic period and the like it is important to remember that these imaginative scenes are all inferences from bones and similar fragments
in fact there is nothing fixed about such interpretations because the way the fossils are understood may change over the years but it is usually some time before new discoveries percolate into the popular presentations
even the most dinosaurs may have changed their habits in the last few years
many different lines of evidence may be used to flesh out the bare bones of the fossils
the first of these is the evidence of the rocks from which the remains were recovered
the sediments themselves reveal much about the environment of deposition as was shown in chapter
it is important to establish whether the fossil animal actually lived in the environment which furnished its sedimentary cover or whether its remains were swept in from some other place
fortunately it is usually easy to spot such intruders
the type of sediment and the associated fossils will show whether the environment was marine freshwater or terrestrial providing the basic information into which the ecology of the animal has to be accommodated
the sediments themselves may have preserved some of the tracks left by the animal to give direct evidence of its past activities
from the tracks alone it is possible to be certain of the bipedal stance of certain dinosaurs and to measure their stride
the character of the rocks and their setting in the past geography at the time when they accumulated diagnoses the climatic setting in which the extinct fauna lived and climate imposes certain restraints on possible modes of life
savannah animals differ from those of tropical rain forests and these again from inhabitants of the tundra at high latitudes
looking at the fossil animal itself the first necessity is to reconstruct it as accurately as possible from its fragmentary remains
sometimes this is a very complex business particularly for vertebrates with numbers of small bones
to proceed from the reconstruction to an assessment of probable life habits two different but complementary approaches are used
one method attempts to compare the structures of teeth or limbs or some other feature of the extinct animal with living analogues
these do not have to be biologically related organisms
the basic argument is that structures that are closely similar were probably adapted to a similar function
sometimes these similarities are quite obvious the ferocious teeth of a predatory dinosaur are a sure indication of hunting habits with hardly a glance at the fangs of living mammalian carnivores
but the structure and functioning of grinding or chewing teeth in other mammals in which opposing teeth in action and which can be matched in extinct unrelated mammals is a much more subtle matter involving detailed studies on the operation of living dental systems to help elucidate the functioning of fossil ones
the technique of hunt the analogue is a favourite one practised by palaeontologists but it is certainly not a foolproof one because there are many fossil animals that defy comparison with living organisms and some analogues do not stand up to detailed scrutiny
the second method tries to analyse the structure of the fossil almost as if it were a piece of engineering
if the fossil is constructed in a certain way then there are only a limited number of jobs that the structure could perform
the idea here is to decide which of the possibilities is the most likely one
this assumes that nature only manufactures efficient designs
for the most part this is a reasonable assumption to make
most animals today do seem to have bodies that accord well with the functions they have to carry out to survive flyers are aerodynamically efficient active swimmers have suitable streamlining herbivorous mammals have teeth appropriate for grinding plant food and so on
ideally one could construct a model of the fossil to test out these various functions in experiments but the number of examples where the analysis has been pursued this far are limited
of course it can never be known whether the right answer has been reached unless somebody dredges up a living fossil from the depths of the ocean there are only varying degrees of probability
but the best answers are probably obtained where the functional design of the fossil points to the same life habits as a living analogue and where both are consistent with the geological circumstances in which the fossil remains occur
swimming trilobites
there are thousands of different kinds of trilobites
all of them were marine and all of them are extinct
since many kinds of trilobites at any one time they were probably occupying different ecological niches behaving in different ways corresponding with the wide variation in shape that they show
we can use the methods described above to elucidate some of these occupations and get a glimpse albeit an imperfect one of the trilobite as it lived
i will take an example where all the methods can be used and where all point in the same direction so that the answer is probably correct
most trilobites were broadly being rather longer than wide not greatly convex and with eyes that occupy perhaps a quarter of the length of the head
there are a few trilobite species however with enormous globular eyes see below
by examining the way these animals were put together it is possible to suggest a likely mode of life
ordovician trilobite seen from the top and side
twice its natural size
enlargement shows a section through the lenses to show the direction of the field of view
we can take the eyes first
the trilobite eye was of a compound type and each lens was made up of a calcite crystal
from the optical properties of this mineral we know that the lens was able to interpret light coming from a direction more or less at to the lens surface
so we can deduce what the field of vision of our trilobite was by looking at the directions in which all the lenses face
it turns out that our animal was able to see in almost every direction upwards downwards sideways and forwards and even backwards because the eyes bulged out beyond the line of the rest of the body
most other trilobites have a predominantly lateral field of view
if the animal lived on the sea bottom it seems unlikely that it would have eye lenses specialized for looking downwards and we begin to suspect that the animal habitually dwelt above the sea floor
other features of its shape are consistent with this
at edge of the eyes are a pair of long spines and these point downwards at a steep angle at very awkward attitude for resting comfortably on the sea floor
most normal trilobites have a more or less horizontal rim around the forward margin which may have rested on the sediment surface
the thorax of the trilobite is remarkably long compared with the average trilobite compare fig
the convex middle part of the thorax contained the musculature that operated the appendages which as usual are not preserved and the relatively large volume of this region shows that the musculature was powerful
the construction of this trilobite suggests that it lived an actively swimming life well above the bottom and possibly in the surface waters of the sea
of course because there are no living trilobites we can not find direct confirmation of this hypothesis but we can look for other arthropods that have the same modifications of the eyes for example in the present day oceans
the analogy is found in such amphipods a kind of shrimp as cystosoma which also has enormously expanded eyes looking like headlamps compared with its relatives see above
in fact many of the arthropods that inhabit the water column have large globular eyes of this kind

fossil flowers are extremely rare because of their delicacy and because they are shortlived
these flowers have five oval petals finely veined
no details of the stamens are present in the fossil state
diameter of the flowers is about cm
living crustacean cystosoma
if it is correct that our trilobite lived above the sea bottom actively swimming in the water there are certain predictions we can make about its geological occurrence which can be tested by looking in the rocks
most trilobites preferred to live at a particular water depth or on a particular type of sea bottom mud sand or lime
no such restriction should apply to our species it should be found with all other different kinds of trilobite assemblages without preference
this has been proved in several places in some arctic localities it is found with trilobites that lived at great depths in the muds of the ordovician ocean while in canada the same species occurs mixed with the inhabitants of the seas where limestones were accumulating
by the same token the trilobite may be expected to have a very wide geographical distribution for oceans would be no barrier to it
and again this proves to be the case our example is found in arctic canada in the high arctic island of spitsbergen thousands of miles away in what is now the desert country of nevada and utah in the united states in western ireland in russia and in northwestern australia
so in this case the different sources of evidence all point in the same direction whether derived from a detailed consideration of the way the trilobite is constructed or by analogy with living animals with similar adaptations or from the evidence of the rocks or the distribution of the fossils
these trilobites of the ordovician were active swimmers in the surface waters as near certainly as we can ever know
there are all kinds of different questions we can ask about the life habits of these trilobites which are not subject to the same kind of careful scrutiny
what did they eat for example
because we do not have the legs preserved it is not possible to see how the mouth appendages functioned in feeding and neither are the stomach contents preserved
so here there are only more or less likely speculations
active swimmers in the surface waters of the present oceans are likely to feed directly on the plankton and the trilobites may have had a method of harvesting large quantities of minute food
or they may have been hunters after larger prey in which case when appendages are eventually discovered they may prove to have adaptations for grasping and manipulating larger food
puzzles remain even though we can be certain of the rudiments of the story
controversy among the giant dinosaurs
the giant sauropod dinosaurs like brachiosaurus were the largest land animals the world has seen they weighed more than tonnes and present quite different problems in the interpretation of their life habits from the diminutive trilobites
such spectacular animals have obviously attracted much attention and one might suppose that the problem of how they lived would have been satisfactorily solved long ago
most of the popular books showing the mesozoic giants in their natural setting portray them wallowing about in swamps flanked by deep vegetation their bodies largely under water
surely an animal of this bulk it was argued must be partly supported by water and their relatively inconsequential teeth must have been adapted for chewing on the kind of soft luxuriant vegetation that flourishes in and around swamps
because their nasal openings were on the top of their heads they could even continue to breathe if it became necessary see to totally submerge
recently the life habits of the giants have been looked at in a way that disproves most of these traditional notions
consider the structure of their legs
the sauropods have relatively long legs resembling those of the elephant the largest living land animal and may have been well adapted for supporting the huge bulk of the animal
the feet of the sauropod are small relatively speaking with short stubby toes yet animals that walk on soft mud tend to have spreading feet to distribute their weight more evenly
it is difficult to see how the compact feet of the sauropod could avoid becoming stuck fast in the soft muddy bottom of a lake
if the dinosaur did after all live on dry land then the long neck could have usefully functioned to allow the animal to browse the high foliage of trees see
it has been suggested that an animal of the size of brachiosaurus could not have breathed under water because of the pressure on the lungs
their fossil remains seem to occur with other animals and plants which are generally accepted as terrestrial
there is even some evidence from the tracks they have left behind that diplodocus and its allies moved about in herds
they may have been the gigantic reptilian analogue of the elephant and it may be no coincidence that the elephant also has its nasal openings on top of the skull with the nostrils in this case sited at the end of the trunk it has been suggested that some sauropods may have had a proboscis of some sort
the balance of evidence seems to be swinging away from the original idea of giant dinosaurs to fully terrestrial habits
but other aspects of the dinosaur living habits are still more strongly debated
in the last few years a powerful controversy has arisen over whether the dinosaurs as a whole were like all living reptiles and there is no doubt that dinosaurs were reptiles or resembling mammals in this respect
animals have to warm up before they can be fully active that is why lizards and snakes bask in the sun in temperate climates
for this reason they can not cope with climates having greatly extended winters
animals have the same body temperatures at all times and can be more continuously active but they use far more energy and hence need more food than animals of the same size
the posture of many dinosaurs and particularly the carnivorous theropod dinosaurs was fully erect with the legs beneath the body and unlike the sprawling legs of living reptiles see
the long back legs of such hunters look highly suitable for running and as they did so the long tail may have been held erect as a kind of see
for any kind of prolonged activity would have been a distinct advantage
under the microscope even the bone structure of these dinosaurs looks more like that of living mammals than reptiles
on the other hand it can be argued that the sauropods like brachiosaurus were so large and with a relatively small surface area through which to cool compared with their enormous volume that their cooling rate could have been slow enough to allow them to sustain more continuous activity than smaller living reptiles
it has also been argued that the small mouths of the giants simply could not have downed enough food to support a metabolism particularly plant food that needs a lot of processing before it becomes available as energy
the armoured or plated dinosaurs include some species that seem too heavily burdened with protective armour to have been very active but this does not necessarily mean that they had to be
protagonists of the theory will show some of the horned dinosaurs charging over the cretaceous plains like furious reptilian rhinoceroses
one idea about the life habits of the dinosaur giants published in joc and colette at the natural history museum in
the supporters tend to ally themselves with the supporters of a theory about the relationships of the dinosaurs
this is that the dinosaurs or a close dinosaur relative included the ancestors of the living birds
some of the smaller and most certainly highly active dinosaurs were about the size of a chicken and there is more than a passing similarity between a running ostrich and the kind of reconstruction that shows running dinosaurs
the point is that birds themselves are like mammals and if birds and dinosaurs are as closely related as now seems likely then it obviously increases the likelihood that the dinosaurs themselves may have been
the pros and cons of this theory are the subject of much contentious debate by experts but it would probably be correct to say that the greater number of specialists believe that at least the more bipedal of the dinosaurs including small and large carnivores were active animals
a lot of the argument among the authorities on these animals is about the equivalence or otherwise of certain bones in dinosaurs and bird skeletons and particularly the jurassic bird archaeopteryx this makes for rather dry reading for the layman
but the is the accurate reconstruction of the jurassic and cretaceous terrestrial world over which the dinosaurs were indisputably dominant
action and inaction in the cities
susanne macgregor and ben pimlott
the essays in this book do not amount to a programme but they are intended to provide a springboard for one
the aim is to analyse a problem which economic growth alone has failed to cure and to consider possible new forms of public action
the biggest single difficulty in drawing attention to urban poverty is that it is not new but simply in some of its most worrying manifestations getting worse
like the poor themselves the inner city has long been with us
ever since the industrial revolution created a mass urban society the conditions of the poorest city dwellers have given rise to anxiety among the better off
the inner city has been variously regarded as a cause for moral outrage a threat to public order or as a stain on the nation conscience
meanwhile bad housing bad sanitation lack of education and other perennial ills associated with overcrowding and poverty have been routinely denounced by political leaders and social reformers
a central objective of the welfare state was indeed to alleviate the problems of the urban poor over whom beveridge five giants want disease ignorance squalor and idleness had for so long held sway
in the early and the belief was widely held that a combination of government intervention in the form of town planning housing and health programmes and the provision of social security and permanent male full employment together with an increase in real wages would reduce suffering due to poverty to manageable proportions
the labour government was elected on a tide of impatience at the slackening pace of social reform but also of optimism that little more than economic growth fuelled by technological change was needed to remove the main causes of urban deprivation macgregor
disillusion swiftly followed
the work of peter townsend and others showed that far from presiding over the elimination of poverty the wilson government actually failed to prevent some of its features from worsening townsend and bosanquet
evidence began to mount that much of the social welfare paternalism of the period had created almost as many problems as it solved
neither the butler education act of nor the introduction of comprehensive schools prevented a high proportion of children from
reconstruction and housing programmes seemed to do nothing to prevent and seemed even to encourage a rise in crime and mental illness
meanwhile in many parts of the country a problem as old as cities themselves tension between cultural groups between earlier immigrants and newer ones between black brown and white and increasingly between large sections of urban youth and the police came to be identified as the key issue
rising unemployment turned a lingering and growing malaise into a crisis
as in the united states so in britain it was an outbreak of violence that dramatically brought the plight of the inner cities to public notice
in the early at a time when manufacturing industry was collapsing and the outlook for the unskilled looked particularly bleak frustration boiled over in a series of riots in london bristol birmingham liverpool and elsewhere
all were spontaneous outbursts none contrary to some claims were politically inspired or orchestrated except in northern ireland where urban problems existed on a grander more devastating scale and where there was a unique heritage
many had an ethnic dimension in the sense that many of the rioters were black
unlike however the notting hill riots few of those involved were immigrants the vast majority were british born
and the disturbances could not strictly be called racial the most prominent feature was that of violent clashes between young people and the police
the problems however were not confined to violent upheavals of this kind
paul harrison inside the inner city life under the cutting edge focused on hackney a london borough ranked among the worst off on any scale of urban deprivation harrison
harrison describes the way in which the inner urban leads to a vicious circle with many victims but few individual villains
the police force face the virtually impossible task of keeping the lid on the explosive mixture of ingredients that the dynamics of british society have assembled in the inner city
this mixture heated by recession and high unemployment inevitably generates a high level of crime
this necessitates in turn a far more numerous and ubiquitous police presence than in other kinds of area far more frequent unpleasant contact with the public as potential suspects and far greater opportunities for police misjudgment or abuse
the inevitable sufferers of course are the poor of whom those who actually commit the offences that concern the police are a tiny minority and whom indeed it should be the purpose of the police to protect
not only are the most disadvantaged on the receiving end of most crime argues harrison they also have to put up with the heaviest police presence
they are more likely to be stopped and searched and to be the victim of mistaken arrest or conviction
at the same time the residents of the poorest areas have to suffer in a way that is not true of those who live elsewhere a growing fear of attack on themselves or their property
improved police methods might help writes harrison to contain the problem
but without other changes the result is likely to be a society of barricaded and a steady erosion of civil liberties
and he concludes of all the warnings that the inner city has to offer for the direction british society is taking this is perhaps the most sinister
harrison vision of a nightmarish future for inner cities locked in a cold or hot war between and the forces of public order was echoed by robert chesshyre who concluded that by the late
the basic social contract whereby citizens enjoy certain rights including health care decent education and housing and a job in return for which they observe the rule of law was breaking down
as a consequence an underclass was evolving football hooligans muggers inner city rioters somewhat more frightening than their dickensian forebears because they were mobile and all too visible

the early witnessed a radical change in patterns of heroin taking alongside the global increase
smoking heroin chasing the dragon was one feature of the upsurge
another was the increased availability of and demand for cocaine
sensational media and police reports in seemed to suggest an increased use of crack among young people in parts of south london liverpool and birmingham with attendant fears that this particularly dangerous substance might become widespread as it was reported to be in parts of the united states
for the moment however the pattern of drug abuse in britain remains as varied as ever with drugs such as amphetamines as serious a problem as those that hit the headlines
it is a symptom of public anxiety about urban squalor and less creditably of class and racial prejudice that drugs and inner cities are automatically linked in the popular consciousness macgregor
nevertheless and more particularly the disruptive social consequences of addiction are especially serious in areas of city poverty burr
in short if life was always harder in the inner cities than elsewhere and if conditions may temporarily have been alleviated by the impact of the welfare state and rising incomes the last decade has been widely represented as a period of deterioration
moreover few would dispute that this apparent decline is a reality the first words of the prime minister herself after the result of the election was known were an acknowledgement of the challenge posed to government by the inner cities
what has been lacking however as well as the political will to do something has been any shared agreement on the cause

the view that only outstanding management could meet the problem was held by the audit commission
the picture painted by the commission report on inner london is as gruesome as any ever presented and is itself revealing of common prejudices in its choice of indicators of deprivation

drawing on north american experience the commission concluded that poor management was an important contributory factor to new york problems and sought to apply the same lessons here
the government initiatives have to some extent reflected a diagnosis based on the need for better management though on the principle that central authorities can provide a firmer grip than local ones but combined with an belief in the restorative powers of capitalism
leech and amin summarize this approach not unfairly in the following terms
the encouragement of private investment and the liberation of the market the containment of the forces of social discontent the control of the powers of the local authorities and the encouragement of the movement of the wealthy into the inner city thus creating buffer areas of tory support accentuating inequalities and injustice and hopefully though not necessarily reducing the potential for conflict among the urban poor
the main thrust of the government policy is contained in the january white paper on regional policy and the enterprise economy in the new employment training programme and especially in the march action for cities programme all resting on wider reforms to local government structure and finance and to education and housing
the most striking feature of this package apart from its aim actively to involve employers and entrepreneurs is a sharp reduction in the role of local government
despite the contemporary tone of much of action for cities the programme heritage can be traced to the early studies which provided the basis for the holland report on housing and the plowden report on education as a result of which general improvement areas and education priority areas were established
the urban programme had a social rather than economic emphasis and was administered by the home office
it was initiated partly in response to the furore caused by enoch powell rivers of blood speech much as disturbances at the notting hill carnival prompted further steps on the part of the department of the environment a riot makes a much bigger impact on government thinking as donnison has pointed out than any amount of earnest and accurate research
the urban programme consisted of grants and initiatives under the local government grants social need act which was intended as a flexible instrument to provide supplementary help to local authorities in the fields of housing education and health
originally the programme supplemented existing central and local government schemes designed to meet special needs in urban areas
the scope was extended in an enhanced urban programme which included economic and environmental as well as social projects and was specifically directed at the inner urban areas where the problems were most severe
earlier the change of emphasis from a social to an economic and environmental focus had been reflected in a switch of responsibility for the programme from the home office to the department of the environment
the enhanced programme resulted from the inner urban areas act based on a white paper published the previous year on policy for the inner cities doe the first comprehensive policy statement on the subject to acknowledge it as a definable and cohesive problem
the white paper drew on studies conducted earlier in the decade in liverpool birmingham and london which pointed to a debilitating flight of capital and skilled labour from the critical areas of deprivation
a key aspect of the white paper was the stress it placed on the wider effects of poverty that it was not just those with acute needs who suffered
it argued that in talking about inner cities it was vital to think in terms not just of individuals but of society that the multiple deprivations of the worst hit areas affected all the residents that the consequences included a pervasive sense of neglect and decay a decline in community spirit a low standard of neighbourhood facilities and an increase in crime and vandalism and that without government intervention the future was one of reduced job opportunities deteriorating housing and a decline in public services
the document and the legislation that derived from it pointed to a positively discriminatory approach with both central and local government supplementing existing programmes in such a way as to strengthen local economies as well as the physical and social environment
such measures constituted the present government heritage when it took office in
none of them of course anticipated the scale of the problems which were caused by the slump and collapse of much of what remained of inner urban manufacturing industry in the early
neither at first did the incoming administration foresee the impact of rising unemployment which was to be especially serious among the urban young
true the new secretary of state for the environment laid stress from the outset on the need for economic regeneration and indicated his sympathy for the voluntary sector in the tackling of urban problems
the previous government however had already pointed to the need to revitalize urban economies and at first the shift was more rhetorical than real
michael heseltine has since claimed that we set a new objective to make the inner cities places where people would want to live and work and where the private investor would be willing to put his money
partnership became his slogan the partnership of public and private brains and money
a new urban development grant was devised to with public funds schemes which would then attract private investment
heseltine vision was of partnerships which recognise that there are some things that only governments can pay for but also that the ingenuity and flexibility of the private sector is indispensable
he claims that serious work on policy began in but it was undoubtedly the riots of coinciding with the biggest drop in employment and job vacancies since the war which gave impetus to the new approach
urban development corporations were introduced in in london docklands and merseyside and the urban development grant came in late the following year
conservative instincts were of course to minimize within the partnership state involvement and expenditure relative to that of private enterprise
yet the irony of the early as a deteriorating but perennial urban problem rapidly became the most acute aspect of the crisis of mass unemployment was that a tory government found itself presiding over an increase in state intervention through a variety of agencies
the increased scale of operations also ushered in another fashion of the new management structures
thus in city action teams were introduced to each inner city partnership area to the work of the three government departments involved
task forces meanwhile were directed to tackle youth unemployment
by the urban programme was supporting starter units and business starts in enterprise workshops
it was providing training places often in conjunction with the manpower services commission some buildings were being improved estate action aimed to tackle run down housing and a large number of new partnerships which some might see as subsidies or discredited regional grants in a new guise were in operation in an effort to bring private investment to urban areas
by it was claimed that million of urban development grant and urban regeneration grant had successfully levered more than million of private investment into the inner cities although how much of the latter sum might have been invested in any case is difficult to say
meanwhile there were other incentive schemes enterprise zones for example and simplified planning zones which aimed to lift tax and planning barriers in order to facilitate investment
indeed while with one hand trying to hold down expenditure by local authorities the government found itself by the late involved with the other hand in massive spending on inner urban areas
the department of the environment alone by was spending half a billion pounds out of an action for cities total involving most home departments estimated at billion
perhaps a labour government would have spent even more it would certainly have spent it in different ways
it is a curious comment on thatcherism however that the administration most committed to a reduction in the role of the state and in the need for an independent private sector has spent more on specific urban regeneration and employment schemes and incentives to private investment in urban areas than any other in recent history
one of the most bizarre aspects of government policy has been the effective murder of the voluntary sector and its appropriation by subterfuge into the tory version of the corporate state
conservatives have always lauded the voluntarist principle in welfare and encouraged it from platforms
faced however with the catastrophic increase in unemployment and the need to occupy large numbers of workless people without directly employing them which would have run counter to the economic doctrine which had led to the redundancy of many of them in the first place the government poured money into any voluntary agency willing to put in a bid for cheap labour
one result was the triumphant expansion of some charitable organizations which rejoiced both at their importance and at the government munificence
another was the transformation of many such bodies already heavily subsidized from public funds into de facto agencies of the state which financed them and indirectly determined their policy
nowhere was the impact of this clumsy sleight of hand more evident than in the inner cities where voluntary organizations had been most active and where the government was most anxious for them to mop up unemployment
however the later withdrawal of government support with the scrapping of the community programme as unemployment receded left many of these voluntary organizations high and dry
the national council for voluntary organizations ncvo has suggested from a recent survey that around projects had been affected and had lost million in funding macgregor
there was of course a crucial element in the government anxiety the high concentration of ethnic minorities in the areas of concern
in nearly per cent of ethnic minorities in the uk lived in partnership or programme areas
there is a danger in reading back from this figure another stereotype similar to the pavlovian drug city assumed link
some urban areas have serious problems without a major ethnic dimension newcastle teesside not all members of ethnic minorities are poor or deprived
nevertheless the high proportion of inner urban populations composed of people from ethnic minorities and the high incidence among these groups of all the indices of poverty and social and environmental hardship combined with the specific problem of rivalry harassment and tension make race and ethnicity an aspect that is central to any analysis of the inner cities and of any ameliorative approach
making sense of the riots
reactions to the riots have concentrated on a number of key variables that are said to characterize the localities in which the riots have occurred
lord scarman report on the disorders highlighted the importance of unemployment urban deprivation racial disadvantage relations between young blacks and the police the decline of civic consent and political exclusion as the key issues
other reactions have concentrated on the issue of the interplay between decay and racial disadvantage in contemporary britain
yet others have argued that the unrest can be seen as a symptom of the breakdown of law and order in british society gaffney hall keith
the main issues that were prominent in debates during were race and law and order
this was by no means an accident since throughout the a powerful body of media political and academic opinion had been constructed around the theme of how britain was drifting into a violent society and how the basis of consent was being shifted by the pressures of immigration and the growth of inner city areas
a glimpse of the impact of the riots at this level can be achieved through two important debates in parliament
the first took place in the midst of the july riots and had as its theme civil disturbances
the tone of the debate was set by home secretary william whitelaw introductory statement in which he spoke of a the need to remove the scourge of criminal violence from our streets and b the urgency of developing policies designed to promote the mutual tolerance and understanding upon which the whole future of a free democratic society depends hansard vol july
the scourge of criminal violence was whitelaw argued a danger to the whole framework of consent and legality on which the political institutions of british society were based
in reply roy hattersley supported the call for the immediate suppression of street violence but warned that the roots of such riots could not be dealt with until all people felt they had a stake in british society ibid cols
the second debate took place on november on the publication of the scarman report and had as its theme law and order
the importance of the riots in pushing the law and order issue and specifically policing on to the main political agenda was emphasized by the liberal leader david steel who argued that urgent action to prevent a drift into lawlessness was necessary from both a moral and a political perspective hansard vol november cols
a subsequent debate on the same issue in march was also full of references to the experience of the impact of street violence crime decaying urban conditions the breakdown of consent between the police and many local communities and the spectre of more violence to come if changes in both policing tactics and social policy were not swiftly introduced hansard vol march cols
the need to support the police was accepted by both the labour and the conservative speakers in the parliamentary debate on the riots and was established as a benchmark for the official response to the riots long before the scarman report was published in november
any substantive disagreement centred around the issue of what role social deprivation and unemployment had in bringing young people to protest violently on the streets
intermingled with the discourses about race and law and order were constant references to unemployment particularly among the young and various forms of social disadvantage and poverty solomos pp
throughout and debates about the riots in the media in parliament and in various official reports hinged around the interrelationship between racial and social factors
the importance of this debate can be explained partly by the political capital which the opposition could make from linking the social and economic malaise of the country at large with violent street disturbances
conversely throughout this period government ministers strenuously denied that unemployment and social deprivation were significant causes of urban unrest
although the scarman report is often taken to be the central text which argues for a link between social conditions and disorder the terms of the debate were by no means set by scarman
during both april and july vigorous exchanges took place in the press and in parliament about the role that deteriorating social conditions and unemployment may have played in bringing about the riots
during the july parliamentary debate on civil disturbances roy hattersley formulation of this linkage provided a useful summary of the social conditions argument
after some preliminary remarks about the labour party support for the police he went on to outline his opposition to the view of the riots as essentially outbursts
i repeat that l do not believe that the principal cause of last week riots was the conduct of the police
it was the conditions of deprivation and despair in the decaying areas of our old cities areas in which the brixton and toxteth riots took place and areas from which the skinhead invaders of southall come
hansard vol july
much of the subsequent controversy about this analysis centred on the question of youth unemployment
hattersley had suggested that the riots were a direct product of high levels of youth unemployment and a furious debate ensued in both parliament and the media about this assertion
the final symbolic cue used to make sense of the protests is more difficult to categorize but its basic meaning can be captured by the term political marginality
while a number of discussions of the roots of urban unrest in the united states have noted the salience of political marginality in determining participation in violent protests skolnick fogelson edelman knopf this issue has received relatively little attention in britain
nevertheless during the events and their aftermath the political context was discussed from a number of perspectives
the scarman report for example located part of the explanation for the riots in the feelings of alienation and powerlessness which were experienced by young blacks living in depressed areas
a successful policy for tackling the roots of urban disorder was seen as one which sought to involve all the community in dealing with the problems of each area so that they could come to feel that they have a stake in its future scarman para
where such arguments did not fit in with the overarching themes of race violence and disorder and social deprivation they were either sidelined or pushed into the of official reports
the scarman report for example contained the following policy proposal i recommend that local communities must be fully and effectively involved in planning in the provision of local services and in the management and financing of specific projects scarman para
such a move towards greater political integration was seen by lord scarman as essential if the gap between residents and the forces of law and order was to be bridged
but the concern with overcoming political marginality remained on the sidelines of the main public debate because it questioned the perception of the rioters as driven by irrational uncivilized and criminal instincts
this did not however stop the question of political marginality and the need to reform existing policies from being raised at all as can be seen subsequently by the attempts after to introduce both locally and nationally measures which were meant to address some of the grievances of the rioters and to ensure that further disturbances did not occur
aspects of these measures are considered further on in the chapter
perspectives on the riots
despite widespread predictions of further unrest in the aftermath of the scale and the location of the riots seem to have surprised even some of the most astute commentators
handsworth for example was presented even shortly before september as a success story in terms of police community relations
the outbreak of violence in this area was therefore widely presented as an aberration
similarly the spread of violence in london to areas such as the broadwater farm estate in tottenham was seen as a break from previous experience which had centred on areas such as brixton
there are many continuities between and in relation to the images used in the press and television to cover the events
but responses in were different at least in terms of degree and probably in relation to the extent to which the riots were seen as a race phenomenon by a wider body of opinion
the ambiguities and to be found in much of the press coverage during had at least acted as a countervailing tendency against the more extreme forms of discourse which blamed the riots completely on black people
during the riots and their immediate aftermath the imagery of race was used by sections of the press without the sense of ambiguity which could still be found in
the silence over race was breached in but in debate about racial issues was taken a step further
peregrine worsthorne for example used the ferocity of the confrontations in handsworth brixton and tottenham to argue that there was a major question mark over the possibility of assimilating the coloured population into mainstream british values sunday telegraph september
to be sure there was still a strong response opposing enoch powell call for repatriation from all shades of political opinion but the racialization of public debate about the riots went much further than
in this context it was the externality of british and asians which was highlighted rather the racist institutions and processes which worked against blacks at all levels of society
the usage of race during the period took on new meanings which had little if anything to do with the impact of racism as such since the emphasis was on the cultural characteristics of the minority communities themselves
after handsworth part of the press response was to blame the riot on rivalry between west indians and asians and even after the arguments were criticized by local residents and community leaders they were used to explain what happened
in addition the question whether the cultures and values of the black communities their family structures and their political attitudes bred violence was constantly raised van dijk
the actual facts of who was arrested during the riots whether black or white were hardly debated since it was assumed that they were mostly black and mostly unemployed and involved with crime keith
the imagery of the black bomber used in handsworth was extended to the notion that there were groups of alienated and criminalized young blacks who saw the riots as a chance to engage in an orgy of looting
the dear report on handsworth captures this image and links it to the social condition of young blacks
the majority of rioters who took part in these unhappy events were young black and origin
let there be no doubt these young criminals are not in any way representative of the vast majority of the community whose life has contributed to the life and culture of the west midlands over many years and whose hopes and aspirations are at one with those of every other citizen
we share a common sorrow
it is the duty of us all to ensure that an entire cultural group is not tainted by the actions of a criminal minority
dear
this black criminal minority was constructed not only into the leading force behind the riots but sometimes as the only force
indeed throughout september and october and during the following months the imagery of race continued to dominate debate about both the causes and the policy outcomes of the riots
as pointed out earlier the social causes argument was another major plank of public debate about the riots particularly in relation to the highly politicized issue of unemployment
during this issue was raised once again though by then the extent of mass unemployment and urban and decay was more stark than it had been in
images of urban decay tinderbox cities and ghetto streets linked up with the images of race inequality and black ghettos to produce an analysis more complex but also more contradictory
an interesting mixture of the various images was provided by a story in the daily telegraph under the headline broadwater farm like the divis flats with reggae october
the mirror described the estate as living hell and quoted one resident as saying that you no idea how awful daily life is october
such images were reworkings of arguments already used about toxteth in and brixton in but they were used more widely than in
even the daily mail which deployed the clearest use of race and outside agitator arguments ran a major story on broadwater farm under the headline hulks litter this concrete jungle despair hangs heavy october
a number of stories using such imagery were run by both the quality and the popular press during this period but similar arguments are to be found in parliamentary debates hansard vol october cols and even in official reports produced by the police on the riots in birmingham and london
the cities of inner despair were conceived as the breeding ground for disorderly protest and however hard the government tried to break the causal link between the two it was forced to take on board the need to restore order not only through the police but through promises of help for the inner cities
much as in the social causes argument can not be seen separately from the broader debate about the future of the british economy and society
the government record on unemployment was a heavily politicized issue and just as in it vehemently denied any responsibility for the riots through its pursuit of policies
but the government did find a way of accepting a link between the riots and social problems without bringing its main policies into the debate namely by linking the growth of violent disorder to crime and drugs
the emphasis on crime and the criminal acts of the rioters in the official responses to the riots took a general and a specific form
the general form relied on the argument that the riots were not a form of protest against the insufferable social conditions of areas or the actions of the police but a criminal act or a cry for loot
this was an argument put most succinctly by geoffrey dear chief constable of the west midlands dear and by douglas hurd the home secretary in relation to handsworth
but it recurred as a theme in official and press responses to the other riots
the specific form was built upon the notion that the outbreak of violence in handsworth and brixton in particular was brought about by drug barons who saw the police attempting to curb their activities and control their territory
numerous examples of this line of argument can be found in dear report on handsworth and in press coverage during the riots
taking the specific argument about the role of drugs and drug barons in stimulating the riots this seems to have served two purposes
first it distanced the riots from the social economic political and other grievances which had been linked to them by locating the cause outside the social problems of dwellers and in the simple greed of the drug barons to accumulate loot
second just as dear image of a few hundred young black criminals was used to explain what happened in handsworth the problem of drugs was used to explain what happened at a national level
the issue of drugs provided an everyday image already a national issue through saturation media coverage and public debate around which the police the home office and other institutions could depoliticize the riots
responding to the handsworth events douglas hurd was moved to argue forcibly that such events were senseless and reflected more on those who participated in them than on the society in which they took place the sound which law abiding people in handsworth heard on monday night the echoes of which i picked up on tuesday was not a cry for help but a cry for loot financial times september
the chief constable for the west midlands geoffrey dear took this argument further by pointing out that the day before the riots a successful carnival had taken place with the support of local community leaders
he drew the conclusion from this that the riot came like a bolt out of the blue guardian november
such language focused attention on the individuals or groups who were breaking the law committing criminal acts and threatening the interests of the majority
potential applications
overview
ian masser
given the extent to which geographic information management is applications driven it is important to consider in some depth the characteristics of some potential application fields
in the process it will be necessary to examine not only the extent to which geographic issues feature on the policy issues agenda in these fields but also the institutional context which governs and the extent to which data are available for research and policy analysis purposes
questions on data availability are likely to be particularly important where users are heavily dependent on secondary sources
in situations of this kind provisions governing access and format may exert powerful constraints on the use that can be made of these data
the first four chapters in this part examine issues relating to geographic information handling in terms of four potential applications fields
the authors were asked to review the current state of the art in their fields with particular reference to the likely requirements of the future policy issues agenda in terms of the demands that they make on geographic information management
authors were also asked to evaluate critically the state of geographic information provision in terms of the needs of users and to consider the impact of user requirements on the development of geographic information handling methodology
in this way the chapters in this part present a number of perspectives which essentially complement and amplify the discussion in the previous part
in this case however methodological issues are tackled from a largely user standpoint whereas in the previous part they were viewed as substantive problems in their own right
in effect the product of the discussion in both parts is a matrix where the methodological issues are listed along one axis and particular applications fields on the other
figure summarizes the main features of this matrix
there are important differences between the chapters in this part both in the nature of the demands that they make on geographic information and also in the relative importance that is attached to geographic criteria as against other issues by planners and in these fields
the first three chapters dealing with environmental monitoring natural and technological hazards and settlements and infrastructure applications make use of a very wide range of geographic information
a major feature of these applications is the extent to which they involve overlays of a variety of information drawn from different sources on a topographic map base
for this reason they make particularly heavy demands on current gis technology both because of the size of the data sets and the diversity of the data structures that are involved
brown chapter on geodemographics discusses an application field where primary data collected for operational purposes are typically evaluated in relation to secondary data derived from sources such as the census of population
the range of data sets involved and the demands that are made on gis technology in applications of this kind are often more limited than those of previous applications fields
however this is offset by the demands that are made on spatial analysis and modelling methodology
rhind chapter on environmental monitoring and prediction discusses the role of geographic information management in promoting sustainable development on a global scale in the context of the issues identified in the brundtland report
it points to the impact that the findings of global environmental research are likely to have on most sectors of the uk economy
this contribution also indicates the wide variety of groups that are involved in monitoring environmental change and draws attention to the role that the european community is increasingly playing in these efforts
one of the examples of work in progress discusses research that has been carried out for the european commission as part of the corine project
this highlights the challenges for research in a field categorized by a lack of data for some countries varying definitions and standards in use and unreasonably high user expectations
the chapter as a whole draws attention to a number of key methodological issues that are involved in environmental monitoring and prediction
these include the highly specialized nature of much of the technical analysis the limited capacity for checking the accuracy of many of the findings of this kind of research and the consequent need for the development of inference machines for extracting useful information from secondary and often proxy data
in chapter gatrell and vincent consider a wide range of natural and technological hazards including industrial hazards risk assessment hazardous waste disposal emergency planning natural hazards and environmental epidemiology
the substantive content of much of this research straddles the social environmental and mathematical sciences
to model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas generated by a chemical explosion and its impact on the surrounding area for example an understanding of atmospheric dispersion models epidemiology and population distribution would be required
in applications of this kind the authors argue that geographic information management in general and gis in particular have an important role to play and they give a number of examples from research in progress to illustrate the current state of the art in this field
the discussion of operational problems and prospects further amplifies many of the issues raised in preceding chapters particularly with respect to the problems caused by the dependency on secondary data sources and the need for much more detailed geographic information to overcome some of the problems associated with linking data sets
like most of the other contributors to this section gatrell and vincent see decision support systems as a major area for future development in the geographic information management field
given that most gis are rather dumb systems requiring intelligent very computer literate users managing natural and technological hazards means that this knowledge base must be built into the system so that it can be utilized quickly by untrained users after a disaster has taken place or in an emergency
the settlement and infrastructure field is also characterized by a wide range of users with a great diversity of interests
these include not only central and local government but also major utility companies and transport suppliers
according to shepherd these users share a common need for information on the amount capacity and condition of urban land transport networks utilities hospitals schools and other major communal facilities
in addition to these data requirements such users are also interested in developing their capabilities for modelling the changing relationships between the supply and demand for infrastructure in the context of both public and private sector
shepherd more than any other contributor to this section draws attention to the extent to which current efforts in the geographic information management field are constrained by the highly fragmented nature of both data suppliers and users both in sectoral and spatial terms the great diversity of data sets in varying formats and the difficulties presented by institutional factors such as copyright provision data ownership and the control of access to data
digital data occupy a central position in this applications field and a number of examples are given to illustrate the extent to which their development has been hampered or facilitated in various countries by the policies of the organizations with responsibility for digital data provision
in chapter brown reviews the development of geodemographics from its origins in the social area analysis of us census tract data from onwards
he describes the features of the four main systems that are currently in use in the uk and illustrates their application with reference to examples drawn from retail analysis and store location market research credit rating and target marketing
brown demonstrates the extent to which the growth of research activities in this field has led to the emergence of improved cluster analytic methods for the multidimensional classification of people according to the type of area in which they live
in the last part of this contribution brown identifies a number of priorities for future research
like gatrell and vincent and shepherd before him he is concerned with the lack of detailed geographical information particularly in this case with reference to the years between censuses
spatial linkages also feature prominently in brown discussion which amplifies many of the points made in the earlier contribution from openshaw in chapter
the analysis points to the need for the development of a fuzzy geodemographics methodology which takes account of the effects of different types of spatial errors
other major research priorities for the future in this applications field are the development of techniques to explore the factors affecting consumer choice
this is particularly important in a field where many of the demands made by users are highly specialized in nature
in summary then as fig shows many of the issues raised by this review of geographic information handling in the four potential application fields are essentially complementary to those discussed in the part on methodological developments
spatial analysis features particularly prominent on the research agenda relating to natural and technological hazards and geodemographics
questions relating to data integration emerge as being particularly critical in terms of environmental monitoring and settlement and infrastructure applications
spatial linkages and questions relating to spatial representation feature prominently in the settlements and infrastructure and geodemographics fields
the evaluation of error propagation is a matter of considerable significance in the environmental monitoring and settlements and infrastructure fields
finally in all applications fields the findings of the reviews above suggest that there is a need for improvements in user interfaces of all kinds
this is particularly evident in the demand for the development of decision support systems and modelling capabilities
such demands highlight the extent to which geographic information management must be regarded as a means to an end rather than an end in itself when viewed from the standpoints of the needs of planners and
the final chapter in this section rounds off the discussion of research with an examination of organizational issues that need to be taken account of in handling geographic information
campbell presents a conceptual framework for the analysis of the organizational issues involved in the development and implementation of gis
this contribution cuts across many of the questions relating to particular applications that were raised in preceding chapters and draws attention to the dangers of neglecting institutional and personal considerations in practice
all too often as the experience of many mature applications indicates technical and matters dominate the system development phase and technically elegant solutions are devised which fail to take enough account of user needs and capabilities
campbell discusses the role of geographic information in organizations and the process of gis diffusion drawing upon research from a variety of social science disciplines
the findings of the analysis are summarized in two sets of research questions for all applications fields
in this way she sets out a research agenda for research which serves a similar function to the spatial analysis research agenda set out by openshaw at the beginning of part two
environmental monitoring and prediction
david rhind
introduction
monitoring of the state of and the changes in the environment is now universally recognized as being of profound importance to mankind tickell
this awareness is most obviously manifested by the frequent appearance of press reports on ozone depletion on the greenhouse effect and possible global warming on nitrate pollution on deforestation in the tropics on decreasing biological diversity and on many other environmentally related topics
usually these reports concentrate on prophecies of a forthcoming armageddon but many also describe a dire contemporary situation
thus the algal bloom off the italian adriatic shore in is reckoned to have caused the holiday trade and local fisherman losses running into tens if not hundreds of millions of pounds
more globally the brundtland report wced noted that in the days during which the world commission was at work

the african drought put the lives of million people at risk and may have killed million of them

the bhopal accident killed and injured more

the chernobyl disaster caused environmental damage across europe

a chemical fire in switzerland caused toxic materials to be transported by the rhine at least as far as the netherlands

at least million people died of diarrhoeal diseases caused by malnutrition and dirty water
as a consequence of these and other disasters of rapid and broadcasting of them and of the concerned action of many individuals the environment is now moving fast up the political agenda patten
the then prime minister also emphasized the political awakening to the environment in statements such as it is possible that with all these enormous changes population agricultural use of fossil fuels concentrated into such a short period of time we have unwittingly begun a massive experiment with the system of this planet itself thatcher
the political concern is not altruistic
mrs thatcher a recent convert to environmental conservation clearly held the opinion that environmental problems are not only soluble but that solving them can be shown to be
in the past when we identified forms of pollution we have shown our capacity to act effectively
the great london smogs are now only a nightmare of the past
we have cut airborne lead by per cent
we are spending billion on cleansing the mersey basin alone and the thames now has the cleanest metropolitan estuary in the world
even though this kind of action may cost a lot i believe it to be money well and necessarily spent because the health of our economy and the health of our environment are totally dependent upon each other
the government espouses the concept of sustainable economic development
stable prosperity can be achieved throughout the world provided the environment is nurtured and safeguarded thatcher
the primary official manifestation of this uk commitment to the environment has been the government white paper hmso
while criticized by many on the grounds that it had few teeth and represented a compromise between the doe and all other departments notably those of agriculture and of transport it was none the less a major achievement
its main sections dealt with the government approach to the environment nationally at the european level and globally the nature and effects of the greenhouse effect environmental problems in both rural and urban areas especially in relation to matters pollution control and enhancing awareness of environmental matters
central to this approach is said to be an emphasis upon guidance from the best available scientific evidence
there is also a clear recognition of the need for monitoring and modelling of the state of the natural and environment
though there has been a change of prime minister and of the secretary of state for the environment since the publication of the white paper the environmental cause seems as strong as ever
thus the times of december reported that a group of of the most senior civil servants had met the previous weekend to discuss ways in which the government machine could respond better to national and international problems such as the threat of global climate change
pearce et al have argued that the effects of government commercial and other actions on the environment can and should be assessed on a basis and this seems likely to be the basis on which at least the uk government will proceed
given such a lead it is scarcely surprising that british scientists have sought to demonstrate the practical and financial consequences of environmental events and processes table for example illustrates their perception of the importance of global environmental research to the uk domestic economy
if it now seems that monitoring of the global environment is necessary indeed is even vital the prediction of what is likely to happen is almost as important the people in the maldives are understandably worried about the prospect of global change since no part of the islands is more than m above present
yet as we shall see below the prediction of the activities of natural and environmental systems requires an understanding of the interaction of processes that in many cases we simply do not yet have
even monitoring of the present is very imperfect as witness the order of magnitude variations in estimates now current for deforestation rates
this chapter then attempts to review some of the problems in environmental monitoring and prediction describes some of the relevant scientific and organizational activities and looks ahead to what is likely to happen next
the nature of environmental processes
notwithstanding mrs thatcher confidence that we can fix environmental problems the difficulties associated with a task even as apparently simple as monitoring a state variable are considerable
some of the reasons for this the difficulty of deciding on appropriate proxy variables and on economical yet temporal and spatial sampling frameworks taking account of the relative importance of aperiodic and rare events as compared to processes processing the vast volumes of data usually involved and organizing the multidisciplinary and often multinational researchers involved are discussed briefly later
even at this stage however it is important to stress that we have a very incomplete understanding of many processes in the natural environment
the next section therefore attempts to summarize what we do know it is derived chiefly from the earth system sciences committee essc
temporal and spatial scales of operation
even ignoring the effects of man earth system processes operate at a variety of spatial and temporal scales see fig see also rosswall et al
thus microclimate effects can have major implications for local populations such as those brought about by the photochemical smogs of los angeles are often applicable only over areas of a few hectares or less and may operate on a diurnal cycle
in contrast soil creation cf soil degradation may require hundreds or thousands of years
in between are variations in phenomena such as el nino
the sampling theorem indicates that we must sample these phenomena at a frequency of no less than half their wavelength if we are to avoid bias in measurement
in this chapter the primary concern is with changes occurring over time spans from minutes to centuries and from spatial wavelengths from about m to about km
it is however impossible to separate out processes acting at different scales and over different periods a single volcanic eruption lasting hours or days sometimes leads to dust and gas being ejected into the atmosphere over a period of months and this in turn may lead to global climatic fluctuations over years or decades
conversely a and phenomenon such as the movement of tectonic plates can lead to local stress accumulation and to its release by an earthquake in a few seconds and with highly local effects
this therefore has the following consequences

we should know something about the periodicity of the variables we are monitoring if we are not to risk either unnecessarily detailed data collection or aliasing of trends

since we know that the periodicity of some variables is longer than the monitoring already carried out by human beings we must make use of surrogate or proxy variables to extend our range of knowledge such as via tree rings palynology oxygen isotope ratios from ice cores and geomorphological evidence of environmental change

since we are not yet able to predict all the interactions which may be important in a study of environmental problems collecting potentially useful data as well as those believed central to the problem under study is often wise

we must accept that most data collection exercises will inevitably be a compromise on the grounds of cost and hence less than perfect data sets will be produced

irrespective of the use of surrogates monitoring environmental processes only makes sense over which are extended by human standards hence the igbp see below is designed to run for two or three decades

changes in political priorities may simply result in the need for informed guesswork if suitable data are not available
much attention will be given throughout this chapter to monitoring the environment on a global basis
this is not merely because of its topical nature
the main reason is that though some problems are local and are best studied that way many others even involving a limited geographical extent are best understood within a global framework
thus no meteorologist would attempt to forecast the weather or days ahead without using a mathematical model based on observations from all around the world
moreover recent work has shown that much of the heat energy in the seas of the north atlantic every square kilometre of which gives off as much energy as a nuclear power station and hence influences our weather is absorbed from sunlight in the tropical pacific and is carried by ocean currents through the drake passage and up into the atlantic
thus to understand some local and many regional national and continental and all global environmental events we need to have a global perspective and hold global databases rhind and mounsey mounsey and tomlinson
in no way however does this invalidate the need for microscale studies for instance while global data sets may indicate the extent of algal blooms and may suggest causes of them only detailed study of the algae themselves can provide understanding of why the bloom is occurring
the processes themselves
a major complication however is that the environment can rarely be treated as in a laboratory experiment
given this determining the nature of the interactions between the variables becomes a matter of major difficulty
figure is taken from essc and is an attempt to show the interactions between environmental processes as well as the indicators and implications of change in the state of the environment
in essence the figure can be summarized as showing processes within the physical climate system and within the biogeochemical one these systems being interwoven by the global role of water and increasingly affected by human activities
the main components of the first system are well known the atmosphere is its engine and atmospheric circulation is driven by differences in solar heating between the equatorial and polar regions
we are however becoming ever more aware of the massive influence of oceans on our climate research into interactions is now a priority
in ocean dynamics studies important topics are heat storage circulation and the role of sea ice
atmospheric circulation and in turn precipitation and temperature is also greatly affected by the balance of thermal energy at the land surface itself affected by the vegetation and terrain characteristics
the biogeochemical system embraces the totality of the movements of the key elements essential to life carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorus and others through what has been described as the total earth system
the oceans and their biota play a central role in the carbon and nutrient cycles global ocean circulation is also critical to the global carbon budget
trace gases in the atmosphere are key components of the cycles of such elements as carbon nitrogen oxygen sulphur and the halogens as is now well known their concentrations are much influenced by biogenic and anthropogenic activities and the concentrations of such gases as carbon dioxide ozone methane nitrous oxide and the chlorofluoromethanes cfms strongly affect radiative transfer and provide a link with the physical climate system
a particular cause for concern is that the concentrations of the two main cfms is increasing by about per cent per annum while the equivalent figures for methane nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are and per cent
finally the chemistry of the stratosphere is dominated by the photochemical production and catalytic destruction of ozone
there are several important ways in which biogeochemical processes can influence climate and hence habitability except where the latter is maintained at enormous cost
if for instance the concentrations of certain trace gases see above continue to increase it has been predicted that the earth surface temperature will increase by an amount comparable to that since the last major phase of the most recent glaciation about years bp though there is some dispute about the magnitude of the likely change
the converse case the effect of physical climate changes on biogeochemical processes is also of obvious importance changes in annual averages and cycles of temperature and precipitation together with the probabilities of extreme events such as prolonged droughts or frosts are major determinants of terrestrial ecosystem type at least in areas largely unaffected by human activity
changes to the environment have increased rapidly as a consequence of growing population numbers and of numerous developments in technology
fossil fuel combustion for instance has led to increased concentrations of sulphate in precipitation acid rain and many rivers lakes and estuaries have been greatly affected by phosphates from agricultural urban or industrial sources
it should be stressed however that while the outlines of human activities are clear there are still many uncertainties for instance we know that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has risen about per cent since
but calculations of the total carbon released by fossil fuel combustion imply that if all such carbon remained in the atmosphere the concentration would have increased by twice as much
the absolute difference between the two figures seems to be due to two different factors absorption by the oceans and other reductions in carbon stocks in living biota the latter being strongly affected by human activities since the industrial revolution
does god play dice
much environmental prediction is predicated upon a logical positivist or newtonian deterministic basis
the environmental systems are effectively regarded as machines whose workings can all be discovered described in differential equation form and whose future activities can thus be predicted in detail if their initial states are known
an argument by many atmospheric physicists for example is that shortcomings in the accuracy of weather prediction over periods of more than a few days largely results from the unsophisticated nature of existing models the lack of suitable data and inadequate computer power see fig derived from tyler
in contrast the advocates of chaos theory stewart argue that some natural systems are so sensitive to tiny stimuli that even the faint beat of a butterfly wing could be the ultimate trigger for a hurricane
in essence they argue that tiny differences in the initial conditions of many systems can lead to widely different outcomes since the systems exhibit stochastic behaviour within a deterministic framework
if so there is little chance of making accurate forecasts of these systems
this has been recognized by among others essc
the authors of that report accepted that there is a theoretical limit of weeks in explicit prediction of fluctuations in weather because of the influence of turbulence within the dynamics such limits imply that medium and prediction must inevitably be stochastic
to complicate matters still further however it seems at least possible that the components of the earth system may best be predicted deterministically at some spatial and temporal scales but stochastically at others and that the basis of prediction will differ for different components
as an example atmospheric temperature shows marked variability a strong seasonal cycle with some variations a weak minimum variability for year averages and then increased variation again at longer essc
it need hardly be pointed out that coping with such multiple databases on which modelling is to be carried out is not a trivial exercise
finally it is perhaps worth concluding this section by emphasizing that there is still much controversy among the scientific community about the magnitude of many of the effects being discussed
in general the research work of the international groups of scientists including those involved in the committee and in the uk committee on global environmental change has progressively reduced the magnitude of the predicted effects of for example global warming
in giving the robens coal science lecture at the royal institution sir john mason a former director of the meteorological office urged caution in interpreting the results of the massive atmospheric and oceanic modelling exercises as the equilibrium models are refined to take account of the thermal lag in oceans etc lower values of predicted changes are likely
thus while almost all scientists are at the time of writing convinced from the evidence that change in climate is under way and that regional effects may be much greater than the global average the magnitude of the latter is now thought likely to be about half of what was predicted only years ago
who is involved and what is going on
if we consider the environment in the broadest sense much monitoring of it has been in progress for many years and by an enormous diversity of organizations in the uk these include the doe the forestry commission the nature conservancy the health and safety executive local authorities the component members of the natural environment research council such as the institute of terrestrial ecology and the british antarctic survey individuals or research groups in academia the cegb the friends of the earth and uk centre for economic and environmental development ceed
the diversity of monitoring organizations seems just as great in other countries numerous multinational organizations both the un environment programme unep and the international union for the conservation of nature iucn and the international institute for environment and development iied are also active in the field
moreover commercial monitoring of the environment is now also routine notably to predict crop yields in the main areas and hence facilitate the buying of futures
the international scientific involvement
scientists have both promoted and responded to the increasing interest in the environment
thus at the global scale the international council of scientific unions icsu has endorsed the setting up of the international geosphere biosphere project igbp to describe and understand the interactive physical chemical and biological processes that regulate the total earth system the unique environment it provides for life the changes that are occurring in that system and the manner by which these changes are influenced by human actions report of ad hoc planning group for igbp quoted in igbp
priority in the igbp is intended to be given to those areas which deal with key interactions and significant changes on the of decades to centuries that most affect the biosphere that are most susceptible to human perturbations and those that will most likely lead to a practical predictive capability for global change
this is to be put into operation by concentrating on four themes

documenting and predicting global change

observing and improving our understanding of dominant forcing functions

improving our understanding of interactive phenomena in the total earth system

assessing those effects of global change which will be large scale and cause major modifications to both renewable and resources
by igbp had progressed as far as defining a set of seven core projects igbp addressing these four themes
in addition plans for regional research centres and for the data and information systems for igbp known as had been announced
the latter are particularly relevant to this chapter
based in paris and working under professor rasool it is intended to concentrate on managerial and policy aspects of the task in the first years but then to expand considerably thereafter
tasks agreed for the include making available a directory of data directories modelled on nasa master directory providing data sets for education and training and undertaking a land cover pilot study
until remarkably little interaction had taken place between the hard science and the social science communities on global monitoring and prediction
it is noteworthy however that the royal society made a plea for just this type of multidisciplinary work in its submission on greenhouse gases to the house of lords select committee on science and technology royal society
fortunately in addition to the actions of the world hard science community a parallel effort is now being initiated by social scientists fuchs jacobson and price
currently this is organized and sponsored by the international social science council issc the un university and the international federation of institutes of advanced studies
its objectives are to

improve scientific understanding and increase awareness of the complex dynamics governing human interaction with the total earth system

study explore and anticipate social change affecting the global environment

identify broad social strategies to prevent or mitigate undesirable impacts of global change or to adapt to changes which are unavoidable

analyse policy options for dealing with global environmental change and promoting the goal of sustainable development
jacobson and price provide a useful summary of the ways in which human factors contribute to and are affected by likely global changes in particular they stress the importance of the issues and the role of gis in coping with some of the problems of data integration and manipulation
the issc proposed its own work programme in the human dimensions of global change in late
while these organizations intrinsically have a membership and are concerned with research into global environmental change others share the same interest but from a more restricted geographical base
a leading example of this is the european science foundation which has sponsored research programmes in both the physical and social science aspects of environmental change esf
governmental and political involvement
the spread of environmental awareness is readily demonstrated in countries had environmental and natural resource management agencies whereas a decade later the number was wec
in most countries the governmental and political concern with the environment has come somewhat later than that of scientists or concerned lay people the early development of the green party in the federal republic of germany is something of an exception
such a commitment to the environment is none the less both welcome and necessary if resources are to be made available to tackle existing let alone forthcoming environmental problems
the conversion of the uk government has been briefly described earlier it is manifested in their july commitment to spend on climate change research in and the confident request to them from the advisory board for the research councils abrc for an extra in and in the two succeeding years for additional environmental research
perhaps the most significant development of all however is the increasing role of the european commission
their role in bringing environmental impact assessment eia on to the statute book is well known but the commission has now made a proposal cec for the establishment of the european environment agency and the european environment monitoring and information network
the commission argues that there is at present no monitoring of environmental quality and trends on a european scale nor any guarantee that the results of environmental monitoring will be comparable on a basis a realization brought about through the corine programme described later
the objectives of the new agency would be to assist the community and the member states to achieve the goals set out in the treaty of rome and in successive environmental action programmes it must also however be seen in the context of the european council adoption on december of the rhodes declaration on the environment and the environment chapter in the single european act which comes into effect in
the detailed specific roles of the system comprising both agency and network are envisaged as

to provide the community the member states and participating third countries with the objective sic information requested for the formulation and implementation of sound and effective environmental policies

in particular to provide technical scientific and economic information requested by the commission in its tasks of identification preparation and assessment of the implementation and results of environmental action and legislation

to stimulate the development and the application within the agency of techniques of environmental modelling and forecasting in order that adequate preventative action can be taken at the appropriate time

to help ensure the harmonization and comparability of environmental data in the community as well as the integration of european environmental data into international environmental monitoring programmes such as those established within the framework of the united nations and its system of agencies
considerable stress is laid by the commission on collaboration with national agencies and with states adjacent to the community borders
it is envisaged that the totality of activities will extend the existing state of the european environment report cec through addressing the issues of the quality and sensitivity of the environment and also the pressures upon it
priorities for the new agency include study of atmospheric emissions and quality water resources and quality including the marine environment soil erosion and pollution and important land resources and biotopes and nature conservation
at the time of writing the proposal has been approved and discussions are in progress on the location of the agency headquarters
it seems certain to have major and growing effects upon environmental monitoring and prediction in europe and on the policies of component governments
yet this is by no means the only plan which the community has in relation to the environment xii that for science research and development has published details of an extensive r d programme cec and the commission as a whole cec has made public its plans to develop regular official statistics of the environment
the private sector
certain aspects of environmental monitoring have long been carried out by the private sector notably that of crop states on a basis
derived from satellite imagery at comparatively low resolution predicted yields for different crops in different nation states become of commercial value
however significant resources are also being made available by the private sector where there is no immediate commercial gain thus ibm uk ltd has donated of computing equipment to unep and ibm in general is actively supporting other r d which can be expected to facilitate sustainable development ibm europe for instance has invested in its bergen scientific centre to make it the focal point for the company environmental modelling and a centre for information on the environment and sustainable development
on a more modest basis ibm uk have agreed to fund a pilot global population database being built in birkbeck college to permit assessment of the impact of environmental change on the world s population
many other companies of course are supporting environmental work but ibm seems almost to be unique in its corporate commitment to use of high technology for facilitating sustainable development
some examples of environmental monitoring projects
the local scale
at the local scale it is usually impossible to neglect the effects of multiple processes operating
an example of environmental modelling and prediction where the interactions between different processes and dynamic feedback is taken into account is given by haber and schaller
their work formed part of one unesco man and biosphere mab project carried out in the berchtesgaden national park in bavaria
following holling and grossman they conceptualized the relationship at a series of hierarchical levels

the lowest or process level is directly and usually obviously connected to perceived reality
thus processes and interrelationships are mostly obvious simple and linear data are usually readily available and may be voluminous
this level is readily handled in commercial gis

the intermediate or dynamic level is concerned with less frequent and often irregular events a temporary lack of water because of fire frost or excessive demand from an increasing populace
characteristically the data used may be more difficult to obtain and are usually more spatially aggregated modelling software which permits feedback loops is essential

the top or strategic level is the most difficult to explore the external influences are often unpredictable by formal means
relevant data are therefore difficult to identify and scenario building is one of the few approaches available
the haber and schaller approach is to these different levels and their accompanying approaches using an ecological balance model
results of running this with different scenarios include time slice maps of possible outcomes and of the exchange of material and energy within the study area
while ultimately qualitative it seems to offer a method for coping with different types of process and incorporating stochastic and truly random events
the national and continental scale the corine project
the corine programme represents the product of much activity by the european commission xi for the environment
it originates from an italian request to the council of ministers in to identify environmentally balanced and unbalanced areas in the community the first attempts to do this were unsuccessful and though by it was clear that a new approach based on an environmental information system was the most promising one funding for this was not secured until
a experimental programme to collect and ensure the consistency of information on the state of the environment and natural resources in the european communities was set up and labelled corine
the objectives of corine were to be achieved through bringing together existing data holdings in the member states developing methods for holding analysing and presenting the data and encouraging the exchange of data
a number of priority areas were identified including biotopes of importance for nature conservation acid deposition and its effects on soils and biotopes and the protection of the environment of the mediterranean region briggs and martin
many achievements can be claimed by the corine project team
as a result of some involving all the member states and often several groups within each one databases of topography soils water resources and quality biotopes atmospheric emissions climate soil erosion and administrative boundaries have been built up for the whole community and can be interrelated other data sets such as land cover derived from satellite imagery have already been compiled for some of the member states
various aspects of the corine project have been described in papers by rhind et al wiggins et al briggs and martin briggs and mounsey and cec
for the present purposes however the key findings are

many necessary data sets were unavailable for reasons of administrative inadequacies confidentiality constraints cost or in certain countries

the unavoidable reliance upon existing data sets led to many problems due to even of commonly used variables eight different definitions of potential were in use in the member states and maximum temperature at each weather station was defined in at least four different ways

the compilation of a spatially coherent database from mapped information compiled by different organizations at different scales and on different topographic bases see rhind and clark is often difficult

user expectations are often unreasonably high use of administrative computing systems encourages bureaucrats to believe that environmental data can just as readily be analysed and used to support decisions
the fuzzy nature of much geographically distributed data the inherent errors in it the effects of the processing algorithms used and the assumption of known interactions between variables ensures that completely routine use by unskilled users is unlikely to be possible in the foreseeable future

more detailed data are required for particular tasks as the role of corine grows
the european commission proposal for an environment agency see above will subsume the corine team and databases
the global scale nasa and
without question the largest player in the global environment arena is nasa
the organization has initiated many of the schemes which now are under discussion the igbp for instance has been strongly influenced by nasa proposals
a summary of current activities and future plans is given in nasa
by way of example current programmes are collecting global data on stratospheric ozone on and variables and on the earth radiation budget
approved future programmes include the upper atmosphere research satellite the nasa scatterometer and the joint ocean topography experiment
in addition however funding has recently been approved for a much more ambitious scheme the earth observing system eos
this is conceived not as a set of hardware but as a comprehensive information system focused on the needs identified by the essc see above and anticipating somewhat those of igbp
it will collate data from the two proposed space station polar platforms one european space agency platform a japanese one and also from the manned space station
on this basis a data flow of no less than terabyte bytes day is anticipated by the
a major user of nasa data and skills has been the un environment programme
formed in the wake of the stockholm conference unep soon spawned the global environment monitoring system gems as well as an international register of potentially toxic chemicals and a global network of sources to locate and provide technical scientific and management information on the environment
the need for a mechanism to handle the global environmental data was defined in the early and the global resources information database grid resulted
mooneyhan has described the progress of the pilot stage of grid which culminated in approval for a full operational phase grid is now involved in integrating storing and exploiting a variety of global environmental databases mostly acquired from nasa
in addition to the work being carried out in the unep hq at nairobi and in the site in geneva a series of grid regional nodes are now being set up each equipped with the same hardware and software and local subsets of the data
the first of these is in bangkok and another is to be opened in latin america
moreover national nodes are also being set up the recent ibm gift to grid see above has ensured that powerful microcomputers have been installed in many african countries together with national and continental data sets
training of unskilled staff to operate this equipment and to exploit the scientific data is now a major role for grid staff
technical aspects and problems
it follows from much of the above that there are major challenges in use of environmental data
these are best considered by itemizing characteristics of contemporary environmental monitoring and prediction

the use of secondary data rather than primary data collected by the data analyst

the need at least with data on the terrestrial environment for an inference process to extract useful information from the secondary and often proxy data

the data volumes collected are often voluminous even by the standards of contemporary computing facilities

the analyses carried out are often arcane in detail to all but a small group of high priests

we have only a limited capacity for checking the accuracy of many environmental monitoring results let alone of predictions
some of these characteristics are now addressed in slightly more detail it will be obvious that such problems merit a paper in themselves
remote sensing as a data collection process
as the need for more extensive yet consistent and data becomes more pressing increased use of remote sensing seems inevitable
no other data collection methodology obviates the short distance variation in data sets induced by variations in data collection and aggregation methodology typically encountered between adjacent nation states
the problem is now recognized especially in europe and strenuous efforts are being made to harmonise the data sets through the use of standard classifications such as that for land use produced by the conference of european statisticians in
at present however environmental data are far less than ideal
recognizing this nasa concluded that forthcoming global science projects would need land surface altitude data at three resolutions km resolution in xy and m resolution in z on a global basis m xy resolution and m resolution in z for regional databases and m xy resolution and m in z for local studies
they argued that existing maps and digitized files from them are unable to meet these needs at global or regional scale and only remote sensing could help in the short term the availability of stereometric data from the french spot satellite has already led to proposals for automated creation of global digital elevation models with a spatial xy resolution of about m muller
for many terrestrial purposes however a substantial inference process must take place to convert the radiometric measurements into useful information in contrast more direct measurements of sea state etc are possible
the value of this information is inherently dependent upon the quality of the inference process and that in turn depends upon the complexity of the scene the spatial temporal and spectral resolution of the sensors and the particular algorithms used
thus far for instance accuracies of land cover let alone what is often needed land use determined from landsat and spot imagery for the uk have rarely been higher than per cent unless trivial classifications land have been used
one solution to this is to densify the ground control and another is to use contextually based classifiers rather than the traditional spectrally based ones
but the ground conditions in some parts of europe make good results extremely difficult to obtain some areas of portugal for instance have field sizes of only a few metres and exhibit and cropping
a further difficulty is the cost of the data in relation to its anticipated benefits
relatively few studies have yet been carried out except in such areas as crop prediction and ocean navigation where they are generally shown to be highly advantageous in saving someone else money
it may be that a study commissioned from contractors by the british national space centre will provide useful evidence on the cash value of remote sensing it is particularly timely in view of the appointment of professor pearce see above as the adviser to the uk secretary of state for the environment
other work on assessment of costs and benefits of such data have been carried out for the french government by professor didier
finally since data are often costly to acquire it follows that summaries of them the state of the european environment report cec and the environmental data report of the un ep gems marc are of considerable value
equally the signposting role now being adopted by unep grid project which is expected to offer access to a catalogue of environmental data sets and details of the responsible agencies in is to be welcomed
the data problem and partial solutions
the lack of harmonization of definitions and methods of collection of environmental data have already been outlined above
in the european community of nation states for instance no less than eight procedures for calculating potential have been in use
the need for harmonization is obvious and in this respect must follow from the successful pioneering achievements of eurostat in harmonizing the definitions in trade demographic and other social science statistics see cec
an additional and severe problem is that the volumes of data which are already collected are huge by the standards of only a decade ago
by they will be very much greater notably from the eos programme
nasa has announced plans to collect up to terabyte bytes day
since remote sensing data sets especially those pertaining to terrestrial areas of the globe typically need much to calibrate transform and then perform an inference process and hence convert measurements of the radiation reflected or emitted by small areas of ground into useful land cover data the processing power required is going to be formidable
other data sets are smaller in volume but more complex in structure and in their characteristics
to hold all of the scale topographic map coverage alone for the european community would probably require about terabytes of storage
parenthetically the form in which the data may be held can affect dramatically the scale of the problem faced
it would be technically possible for instance to hold in less than terabyte detailed information for every individual in the world akin to that collected about everyone in the uk through the census of population
in practice legislation generally forbids such data being held thus and distributed in anything other than area aggregate form the commonly employed to give tables of population numbers broken down by age and sex often result in a great multiplication of the data volumes
this all presents major problems of data storage handling especially for global data sets display and dissemination
fortunately technical developments have ensured that the increase in computing power per unit cost has been growing at about an order of magnitude every years over the last three decades
indeed this may grossly the present situation the rapid spread of systems seems to facilitate competition and at the time of writing performance of workstations per unit cost seems to be increasing at about per cent per annum
moreover the advent of devices like may well make substantial data sets available even to those with modest computing power a for instance can hold about megabytes bytes can be reproduced currently for about and read on a device costing about
yet despite such revolutionary changes in technology novel solutions will still be required to make effective use of the new data sets
one such solution is goodchild and yang scheme for a hierarchical spatial data structure to handle data for the spherical earth
a particular problem is that little or no quantitative regard has been paid until recently to the effects of quality variation in environmental data
the literature of the last few years is thronged with papers proposing that these must be taken into account but with few realistic proposals on how this is to be achieved
goodchild has made perhaps the best summary of the problem and possible solutions to date
finally relatively little emphasis has been given to the management of data as a corporate resource available to a wide community many environmental data are collected on a basis and lost once the urgency of the initial research is over
however the report of the data and facilities working group of the uk committee on global environmental change argued strongly that planning for the dissemination and maintenance of such data was a vital role
it also noted that ownership of and access to environmental data was a policy matter of the greatest importance this may be more difficult in within country data than with global data since the latter are often already the subject of international exchange agreements at zero cost
global environmental research and the social sciences
thus far the emphasis has been very much on the natural science aspects of environmental monitoring and prediction
that is unremarkable since the anticipation of such problems and assessments of some of their causes and magnitudes can only be made by environmental scientists
yet the consequences of any significant changes are a matter of the utmost concern to planners and to politicians at all levels the quantification of the costs and benefits of alternative policy strategies is very much a matter for economists and the adaptation of societies to massive change is a particular interest to sociologists and others
for geographers who span the conventional and now archaic dichotomy between the natural and the environmental sciences all of these aspects need to be woven together to anticipate the likely spatial patterns of the effects of massive change the redistributions in trade health and wealth which they will bring about and the knock on effects these consequences themselves will have on society and the environment
for social scientists then environmental monitoring and prediction are a matter of considerable significance especially as globalization of markets and economies proceeds
the economic and social research council esrc commissioned two reports on global environmental change to guide or at least inform the allocation of research funding
these reports pearce turner may be taken as informed views from at least the economists in the uk social science community on the social science aspects of global environmental change
pearce for instance presented an economist views of the topics for research as follows

the theory and practice of international agreements viewed in a game theory context

the theory of optimal behaviour under scientific uncertainty

frameworks especially for dealing with climatic effects

definition of the impacts of climate change on eastern europe and the developing countries

appropriate policies on dioxide greenhouse gases

assessment of the ecological values of tropical forest

economic instruments for reducing greenhouse gases

the international politics of climate change

national and global energy options given the greenhouse effect

trade and global change
turner argued that the priorities are as follows

the consequences of rise

techniques for the valuation of environmental resources and effects

an assessment of management tools institutional adaptation and policy integration in regard to global environmental change

studies of agriculture in relation to climate change

understanding of how environmental issues and technical change interact

the interrelationship between environmental ethics and economics
there is then no shortage of social science research which is claimed to be necessary if we are to cope with environmental change
some of it is being carried out in march esrc announced a programme of research on global environmental change
however perhaps most critical of all in the early stages is social science practice rather than research
in the usa at least there needs to be an improvement in scientists understandings of how to influence the allocation of funding for remedial measures or for further research see kitsos and ashe
all too often it seems that the coupling of an as yet imperfect scientific understanding to is tenuous see table
fortunately considerable work has already begun on the legal political and institutional aspects of global environmental change see for instance nitze
what next
the contents of this chapter have scarcely touched upon such important environmental research as the world ocean climate experiment or the world climate research programme
nor has there been any discussion of the growing requirement in the uk as elsewhere to carry out an environmental impact assessment for all major developments
the consequences for some nations or subgroups in a population of being without access to environmental data or the tools for analysing them while others have such access are potentially profound as the european commission has recognized in issuing a directive on public access to environmental data cec yet space limitations have also precluded their discussion
despite these shortcomings dictated by the space available what has been said should be sufficient to illustrate the enormous and diverse scope of environmental monitoring and prediction
such is its diversity that measuring the total expenditure on it seems quite impossible and the number of actors already involved is vast
what is clear however is that monitoring is rarely a simple exercise that the of the sponsors of monitoring and environmental research are rarely long term though most science is inevitably of this nature and that the increasingly multinational nature of such work necessitates a degree of management not always present in local or nationally based schemes
in these circumstances it is scarcely surprising that there is evidence of international and interdisciplinary dispute as terney has chronicled in regard to igbp
moreover as newby has pointed out the complexities of environmental research have created a new kind of relationship between research and policy in the past the relationship was predicated on the belief that science provided with objective hard facts on which to base their soft policies
but now we find scientists delivering only soft uncertain facts to facing hard decisions
yet even if all of this causes great uncertainty among scientists it is still a reasonable prediction that a decade ahead will see both environmental monitoring and prediction treated as an everyday need and activity in major organizations
we shall also see the existence of binding requirements upon national governments certainly in the european community to collect at least basic environmental indicators in a harmonized form cec
more than that it seems highly likely that the social science aspects of environmental problems will underpin the actions of governments and international agencies
perhaps the single most important conclusion to be drawn from this review is that the monitoring modelling and management of the global environment are tasks which uniquely require the integration of skills and techniques from many disciplines
building such research teams is essential
underlying it all however is one obvious fact that the gathering and analysis of geographically distributed environmental data form the necessary for ensuring the success of our future on earth

managing natural and technological hazards
anthony gatrell and peter vincent
introduction
few areas of the application of gis technology can be as socially significant or environmentally relevant as the management of emergencies and disasters due to natural and technological hazards
whether attempting to construct a database of resources for use in planning responses to nuclear emergencies developing optimal routes for scheduling the safe transport of hazardous substances or monitoring the health implications of a disaster gis can assist in identifying possibilities and formulating solutions
the have been declared the international decade for natural disaster reduction
let us hope that can in some small way help mitigate the suffering and hardship felt by all those afflicted by the effects of hazards which as we have learnt with bitter recent experience in the uk can occur in an untimely fashion in the most improbable of places
research on hazards is multidisciplinary and straddles the social environmental and mathematical sciences
if for instance we wish to model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas resulting from a chemical explosion assess its possible impact on human health and evaluate likely evacuation scenarios of the population at risk we would require for example a knowledge of atmospheric dispersion models epidemiology and population distribution
some researchers suggest that hazards and emergencies that might result can be regarded as either natural or technological
we shall elaborate on this simple division below but suggest here that the wealth of literature on the former see for instance burton et al and perry has yet to be matched by a similar volume of work on the latter
there are signs that this imbalance is being rectified zeigler et al
hazard research like few other gis application areas is not only stretching the present technology to its limits but is a quite remarkable focus of international effort into several important areas such as expert systems and simulation studies
in this sense the scene is clearly one of hazard problems looking for improved gis rather than for gis looking for good problems as is all too often the case
hazard research
what are hazards
formally a hazard can be defined as a physical situation with a potential for human injury damage to property damage to the environment or some combination of these health and safety executive
a hazard is a threat which given a set of circumstances may become translated into a realized event
what we choose to call this event depends upon factors such as its magnitude we speak for instance of accidents emergencies disasters and catastrophes each of which carries connotations concerning the scale of the event and each of which will have a set of human environmental consequences
on march one of the most powerful volcanic disturbances this century the bezymianny eruption occurred
few people noticed the event as it took place in an uninhabited part of kamchatcka and caused no known casualties
in contrast the extrusion of a small volume of lava from a secondary cone on the slopes of tristan da cunha became the focus of global interest when during october the island lobster processing plant was smothered and the people of the island only settlement were evacuated to the uk
these two contrasting events emphasize the central fact that even natural hazards are not defined solely by the characteristics of the event but by the interaction of those events with the human occupation of the threatened area
as noted above the simple division of hazards is between those which are natural and those which are technological or
each of these may be further subdivided and the typology shown in fig draws upon the classic work of burton and kates in separating geophysical from biological hazards and zeigler et al in distinguishing public or what we might call societal hazards from private individual ones
the further subdivision of natural hazards is as is that of individual technological hazards
zeigler divides the public hazards into those which result from the production of raw materials and manufactured goods those which originate in transport and transmission and those which threaten the public in their role as consumers
the united nations disaster relief organization undro has produced a classification of disasters derived on the basis of case data table
undro recognizes three basic types of disaster accidents natural events and other disasters
the differentiation of accidents from other types is useful in the context of emergency planning and is not so clearly conveyed by other hazard typologies
however the temptation in all classification exercises is to produce partitional schemes and this should really be resisted here
it is more useful johnson to adopt a scheme fig that recognizes for instance food poisoning as both a personal and consumer hazard or lead pollution from car exhausts as both a meteorological event and technological hazard both public and private
an air crash as at lockerbie affects an entire community directly as well as being an occupational hazard and risk to the individual traveller
hillslope failure as at aberfan in south wales in is a geomorphic hazard but may arise because of raw material extraction
dutch elm disease is a floral hazard but is exacerbated by the transport of infected logs
hohensemer et al make the important point that hazards are multidimensional in nature and suggest dimensions along which any hazard may be scored see table
these factors will of course be important in deciding on the role that gis can play in hazard monitoring and emergency planning
for instance some events will persist briefly have immediate consequences minor transgenerational effects and have little or no potential for mortality an air crash is an example
others such as a chemical explosion involving the release of a toxic gas may persist for a week or more have delayed consequences may affect a future generation if the toxic chemical is mutagenic and may have a significant impact on plant and animal populations
there may be more scope for a gis approach in the latter than in the former situations
the hohensemer scheme is not however beyond criticism
for example can hazards really be thought of as having any intentionality
industrial hazards and risk assessment
once hazards have been identified there may follow efforts to assess the hazard risk
by risk we understand the likelihood of a specified undesired event occurring within a specified period or in specified circumstances health and safety executive
it may of course be easier to quantify risk for natural hazards because of historical records and statistical estimation of recurrence intervals
technological hazards are more unpredictable and may be extremely rare so that it becomes difficult to use probability concepts to quantify risk especially those which rely on notions of relative frequency
the identification of chemical hazards requires that the locations of sites be known together with the dangerous substances stored or processed there
in the uk see petts for a splendid overview the health and safety executive must be notified of sites where hazardous substances in excess of threshold limits are handled
such substances and thresholds include for instance tonnes of flammable liquid petroleum gas and the explosive sodium chlorate and tonnes of toxic chlorine gas
some installations are notifiable along with thousands of kilometres of pipelines mostly natural gas transmission lines
following a number of major accidents involving industrial activities including those at flixborough humberside in beek the netherlands in and seveso and manfredonia in italy in the ec issued a directive on major accident hazards
the directive which is commonly referred to as the seveso directive was issued in june and in the uk its requirements were embodied in the control of major accident hazard cimah regulations
among other things these regulations require operators of hazardous installations to draw up and emergency plans and to give information to members of the public who live or work near such installations houston
there are presently about cimah sites
however many potentially hazardous chemical installations are not covered by such regulations
clearly a plant which stores tonne less than is required for notification slips through the net while large numbers of handling sites warehouses for instance are not covered
the regulations have obvious implications for work as illustrated below
in halton borough cheshire for instance there are notifiable installations with over people living within the defined consultation zones petts
it is also relevant to point out here the work of the health and safety executive in developing techniques for quantitative risk assessment health and safety executive
such techniques include the use of a risk assessment tool riskat inputs to which include data on wind direction and speed the output of which is a map of calculated risk contours
in societal risk assessment it is also necessary to input data on the distribution of population around the installation
this can be a difficult and process and inevitably some simplifying assumptions are needed health and safety executive
again the implications are clear and are discussed below
hazardous waste disposal
the disposal of both nuclear and wastes has proved to be of major public concern in recent years
the rather clumsy handling by nirex of the search for sites to store and wastes together with very recent worries about the import of toxic wastes such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs are but two examples of such concern in the uk
however while the former has been given considerable attention by geographers summarized by openshaw et al there has been relatively little such work in the uk on the disposal of wastes
this contrasts with the situation in the usa greenberg and anderson where the of abandoned sites is a priority
certainly in terms of the volume of waste generated in the uk hazardous industrial wastes should be high on the environmental agenda while less than million tonnes of all nuclear wastes were generated in times that amount were generated of hazardous wastes openshaw et al
attention should be drawn to the three annual reports of the hazardous waste inspectorate now merged with other branches of the doe to form her majesty inspectorate of pollution
these contain some valuable material on disposal practices and volumes of waste generated and disposed of by each waste regulation authority wra counties in england districts in wales scotland and northern ireland
each wra is required to produce a waste disposal plan and these are starting to appear
they too contain useful material on for instance the locations of sites though individual site licences must be consulted for details of what each is permitted to take in the way of hazardous wastes
what is not known is information on the locations of former sites at which quite toxic materials may have been dumped though recent work by egger in austria has mapped a vast number of such sites
it is these rather than existing licensed sites which should be a focus of research activity particularly when examining possible links to ill health
we simply do not have enough evidence yet to back up the claim that people are almost certainly ill dead or dying because of these sloppy waste disposal activities openshaw et al
research is in progress however to assess possible health effects of poor incineration diggle et al
particular attention should be focused on hospital incinerators since these have been subject to crown immunity for many years and most are technically to burn at sufficiently high temperatures for adequate disposal of wastes gatrell and lovett
we need to produce an inventory of all such sites together with a publicly available comprehensive database on all sites accepting hazardous industrial wastes
emergency planning
it is convenient to retain the distinction when discussing the background to emergency planning
nuclear emergency planning in the uk has been reviewed by matthews and pepper
nuclear power stations must prepare a plan and submit this to the nuclear installations inspectorate and health and safety executive for approval
evacuation plans are required to cover an area within a distance of km these detail the roles to be played by the emergency services
the very narrow emergency planning zones contrast with those in the usa collins where planning is required up to km from the site to cover exposure to radiation plumes
local authorities in the uk that have declared themselves have been highly critical of british planning calling for an extension of emergency zones to at least km
zeigler et al should be consulted for material relating to evacuation behaviour in the wake of the incident at three mile island
in the uk little work of any description seems to have been done on human behaviour in the aftermath of releases of hazardous substances nor is much available on public attitudes to emergency planning
indeed no major studies of evacuation due to hazards have been undertaken in recent times and this is a widely recognized deficiency which no research funding body seems willing to rectify
in the usa on the other hand a good deal of useful research in these areas has been undertaken
this research is brought together in very useful reports produced by the oak ridge national laboratory tennessee sorenson et al vogt and sorenson and the disaster research centre university of delaware
perry has written an interesting book on emergency planning and evacuation covering both natural and technological hazards
for him comprehensive emergency planning and management involve prevention protection response and restoration
by prevention we understand the elimination or reduction in risk perhaps by adequate zoning or safe routeing of shipments for instance
included in protection are methods for detecting likely hazard events and in warning those likely to be affected
response includes search and rescue including the need to cope with secondary threats such as contamination of water supplies after an explosion or fire following an earthquake
as perry and others have noted relatively few resources are devoted to the first two aspects the bulk going to response and restoration rebuilding
it should be clear from this brief description that these issues are inherently geographical
in one of the few studies of evacuation behaviour after a hazard event liverman and wilson give weight to this argument
in a train carrying chlorine liquid petroleum toluene and propane was derailed in mississauga ontario causing a series of explosions
this led to the evacuation of people which although staggered over several days led to great pressure on transport arteries
an important finding was that many relied on their own transport and went to stay with friends and relatives some distance away rather than relying on the official evacuation reception centres
despite this the evacuation was successful partly because the accident occurred at a weekend and the immediately affected area was sparsely populated
in addition the police were well prepared stimulated largely by implementing a plan designed more to cope with an emergency at the nearby toronto international airport than for the event in question
it is not without interest to note that in the usa there is a federal emergency management agency fema established in charged with dealing with all types of emergency planning and management
in the uk there is no equivalent though the spate of disasters in the past years involving over lives lost has led to several calls for such a national body to be established
natural hazards
in this short space it is not possible to go into any depth on the nature of particular natural hazards but only to highlight those aspects relevant to gis
needless to say the study of natural hazards is important a statement brought into sharp focus by the fact that natural hazards account for up to per cent of total deaths in the world each year mitchell
in for example more than people died in the cyclone and flooding of bangladesh and in the hurricanes david and frederick caused more than damage in the usa
shah made a comprehensive investigation of natural disaster reports for the period and concluded that both disaster frequency and magnitude measured in terms of lives lost are increasing
high death tolls are still a characteristic of less developed countries
surprisingly fog is the third most important hazard in europe after floods and volcanoes
research on natural hazards has a long tradition in geography going back more than half a century
much of the impetus for such research arose in the usa from observations on river basin management and the need to reduce flood damage
the vast majority of natural hazards studies have ignored the physical nature of the events per se and have concentrated on behavioural issues such as the perception and estimation of hazards
this emphasis is partly due to the background of the researchers involved many are human geographers and sociologists and partly because it is only really since the second world war that major hazards have been monitored systematically culminating of course in the last decade or so in the use of satellite technology
brief reference to two examples of natural hazards may illustrate the potential relevance of a gis approach applications of which are considered below
jones et al have examined the distribution of some landslides in the uk
their maps show clearly an increased propensity for landsliding in the north and west of the uk
more to the point however is the fact that this distribution can be modelled in terms of slopes rainfall rock types and so on
in other words the actual hazard distribution can be understood and areas at risk identified
the potential benefits to insurance companies engineers and planners are clear
second a winter hazard in the uk with marked spatial localization is fog
predictive models of its distribution have clear implications for road and air safety
perry describes a fog potential index that is a function of local topography environmental features affecting fog formation and distance from standing water bodies
reliance is currently placed on a network of monitoring stations often sparsely located and frequently outside areas gis could implement a predictive model based on digitized map features and indeed the model could also be used in site allocation studies for airports and the like
the majority of natural hazard research has focused on single hazards but of course any area may be prone to more than one hazard type
this idea led hewitt and burton to develop the concept of
to achieve this they concentrated on the whole spectrum of damaging events in an area and explored their aggregate impact
the implications for gis in the development of hazardousness indices are obvious and if data are available there is the potential to produce a variety of probability maps
the collection of historical data on natural hazards is important since it is clear that their spatial pattern varies through time
many areas that appear to be on current maps may merely by passing through a temporary period of quiescence
this is perhaps best illustrated with reference to earthquakes
for example in the whole of southern england was affected by an earthquake whose epicentre was located in what is now belgium a good deal of minor structural damage was inflicted morse
presumably the builders of the channel tunnel are aware of this
environmental epidemiology
this is of course a vast subject area embracing the impact of the natural and technological environments on human health
it covers for instance the associations between water and air pollution and ill health links between geological and pedological environments and ill health as well as associations between specific technological hazards power lines and possible health effects
we can only consider a small fraction of this work here little consideration is given to occupational environments for instance
in the uk such research is widespread though there are specialist environmental epidemiology research institutes at southampton and cardiff funded by the medical research council and others at the university of surrey robens institute and at the london school for hygiene and tropical medicine
the latter houses the small area health statistics research unit sahsru which has a specific remit to conduct research into morbidity and mortality at local scales elliot
the sahsru liaises closely with opcs
the kinds of databases used by these groups are discussed below
greenberg and a collection of papers in greenberg review some of the literature on environmental epidemiology
it seems worth stating at the outset that there are two ways geographical research in this general area can proceed
one is to collect morbidity and mortality data usually the latter is more widely available though the former more useful and to examine spatial distributions for clustering
this has itself generated a substantial literature see the papers in elliot for an overview and is nowhere better exemplified than in openshaw geographical analysis machine see ch
we then search retrospectively for evidence of possible environmental associations
an alternative approach is to begin by hypothesizing an environmental determinant of ill health and to collect data to test an explicit hypothesis
if an association is suggested then we would want to collect data in other areas to assess the hypothesis further
of course these two approaches are not in practice in many cases the hypotheses of interest will have themselves been generated by inductive mapping
one example of an hypothesis which has been given serious attention in recent years is the possible link between electromagnetic fields generated by power lines or supply cables and ill health
some work perry et al suggested associations with mental illness and suicide while others wertheimer and leeper have examined links to various cancers including leukaemias
a good bibliography is provided in perry and pearl
the central electricity generating board now privatized and split into two companies is funding a project to assess links to childhood cancer while another recently announced study aims to look at links to sudden infant death
one obvious problem with implications for any gis input is that the effects are highly localized with little measurable field effect more than a few dozen metres away from the route
accuracy of digital data collection either of the power lines or residential locations is paramount
there seems to be a growing interest in examining associations between ill health and the geological environment
gis work in this field matthews is reviewed later but we note here the work of the applied geochemistry group at imperial college responsible for a series of atlases on regional geochemistry and the existence of a society for environmental geochemistry and health
one area of recent debate concerns radon gas and its links to lung cancer
this is taken very seriously in the usa where the environmental protection agency estimates that deaths from lung cancer each year are due to radon gas exposure
estimates from scandinavia suggest that per cent of such deaths are caused by exposure to radon richardson
the gas is trapped in houses and is produced by the decay of uranium in rocks and soil thus it has been measured at high concentrations in parts of cornwall and devon
there are great difficulties in assessing health effects however since exposure varies greatly from house to house within small neighbourhoods
carefully designed studies are therefore required to measure the separate effect of radon exposure after controlling for smoking behaviour and other risk factors
other health concerns which might merit attention by those involved in the regional research laboratory rrl initiative include air and water pollution
the debate about lead pollution from vehicle exhaust emissions is well known less publicity has been given to pahs polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons a product of combustion processes and known to be carcinogenic lioy and daisey
research at the north west regional research laboratory nwrrl aims to create buffers around busy roads and junctions and to use data from the cancer registry to examine possible links between proximity to such sources of pollution and prevalence of lung cancer
those with an interest in health and air pollution should note the availability of a very detailed database from the warren springs laboratory containing details of smoke and sulphur dioxide emissions at a large number of sites in the uk
the possible link between nitrates in water and stomach cancer is the subject of much debate beresford as is the association between aluminium content and alzheimer disease
the problems of assessing such links are of course huge but there is scope for a contribution
the role of gis in hazard management scenarios examples
as we have already implied gis has a role to play in all aspects of hazard research from hazard monitoring risk assessment and emergency planning to coping with an event and evaluating its consequences
the examples described below illustrate all these though as yet there do not appear to be many instances of disasters in the management of which gis has played a significant part
technological hazards emergency planning and gis
a considerable amount of research has been undertaken to apply gis methods to evacuation scenarios around hazardous sites
much of this research has concentrated on network analysis of the road system
reference was made above to cimah sites major hazardous installations for which and emergency plans must be prepared
early research at the nwrrl focused on developing a gis for use by the police and county emergency planning officers in cumbria that would aid in the management of a possible explosion at a chemical factory in whitehaven west cumbria vincent et al dunn
the police required a portable system that could be implemented on an microcomputer
this was written at the nwrrl using fortran and the graphical kernel system
the gis is and is exceptionally pl
it opens with an outline map and the superimposition of the rather rigid zones used by the emergency planners
full zoom facilities are available at any stage
in any emergency it is of course vital to have data on the distribution of population and resources
the system incorporates digitized data on the distribution of all domestic and properties in the town together with digitized road data
both sets of data were provided by pinpoint analysis ltd who are undertaking this digitizing task for the entire country
other spatially referenced data incorporated into the system include those on the distribution of schools medical and transport services which can be displayed and supplementary information about them obtained
the gis permits population estimates to be made for any arbitrary rectangular region on the map
most significantly it incorporates a shortest path algorithm which uses the road network to find optimal routes between start and end nodes
although predating the rrl initiative by several years and indeed the emergence of gis as a major research area we should remind ourselves of openshaw work on appraising nuclear reactor sites
using what would now be called gis skills openshaw examined over km grid squares in the uk which intersect the coastline and related these to data from the census which were made available for such grid squares
he demonstrated that there is an abundance of remote sites in contrast to the official view that such sites were increasingly hard to find
he suggested that in early spatial searches for sites only a small number were ever identified in the first place because rigorous searches could not be performed by manual means with poor quality data openshaw
heywood and cornelius have shown how gis can be used for monitoring possible radiation releases and thus the relevance of gis in nuclear emergency planning and monitoring
they propose a national radiological spatial information system and in a pilot project in cumbria have integrated several layers of data within to show what this might involve fig
such data include those from the population and agricultural censuses as well as point data from rain gauge sites and radiation monitoring stations
as an example the system is used to determine restriction zones for the movement of sheep after the explosion at chernobyl in
this is done by finding areas of high rainfall and parishes with high sheep populations
the map overlay of point and area information shows generally good agreement with the restriction zones imposed by the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food with the exception of a small area to the of cumbria bordering on lancashire
the british government carried out a review of its arrangements for handling nuclear accidents overseas following the chernobyl accident
the doe through her majesty inspectorate of pollution hmip was given the task of a national response plan installing the radiation monitoring network and acting as lead government department in an emergency hmso
the monitoring network has become known as the radioactive incident monitoring network rimnet and has as its prime responsibility the detection of abnormal increases in radiation levels within the uk of the kind that might arise from an overseas nuclear accident
the full implementation of the rimnet system will take some time
by the end of gamma radiation dose monitors had been installed at meteorological stations as part of phase of the development programme
radiation readings are taken every hour at each station and are transmitted to a central computer which analyses the data
the current criterion for alert is two readings of more than three times normal background either successively at the same site or simultaneously at two adjacent sites
the dissemination of information in the event of an incident is dealt with at three levels the first is the normal system of press notices the second is the use of teletext and viewdata ceefax and prestel to get direct to members of the public at their homes or places of work the third is the use of telecom gold electronic mail to get more technical details to various official bodies such as water authorities jackson
phase of the rimnet scheme will be completed by the end of when between and monitoring sites will have been established
given very wide regional and local variations in deposition questions must be raised about the effectiveness of such a small network local authorities will need to supplement it with their own networks
there are important analytical problems to be addressed concerning the siting of such monitoring equipment and these are elaborated on later
abroad kaspar has discussed a exercise with gis overtones involving the simulated evacuation of the population living in the vicinity of the neckarwestheim nuclear power plant in baden
in the scenario he outlines an area affected by radioactive releases is determined the population within that area is allocated to reception areas with capacity constraints evacuation routes are identified and traffic restrictions implemented
little detail is provided however and it is thus difficult to evaluate his work fully
dangermond describes the use of the network module for use in emergency planning situations
he describes how a road network is digitized and subsequently analysed using allocation districting and routeing algorithms
allocation determines which arcs in the network will be allocated to a particular node or centre districting makes it possible to outline rapidly sets of polygons in order to define specific areas of interest districts and to summarize their characteristics routeing provides a minimum path algorithm through the network the arcs of which can be assigned weights according to road conditions road capacity and so on
dangermond gives several examples in his paper including the use of network for the allocation of emergency vehicles optimum routeing of fire engines from garages to the accident scene and the movement of spills through sewers and river networks
when combined with the other facilities in quite complex disaster management scenarios can be handled
for example earthquake fault zones can be combined with data on housing density and structural details to predict earthquake damage levels and these data then related to the network model
vincent illustrates the use of and its network module for finding safe routes for chlorine transhipment on the road and rail systems of england pl
in this case population density data for a km buffer on either side of network arcs were overlaid on the network itself so as to act as weights for the minimum path algorithm
chosen routes were those which minimized population rather than distance
hazardous waste disposal
there can be little doubt that a gis approach has wide applicability in all sorts of location problems where the goal is to minimize rather than as conventionally maximize accessibility to a population
a particularly good application is to the search for potential sites for the disposal of nuclear and but none the less hazardous wastes
we discuss here some relevant work on the siting of facilities for the disposal of nuclear wastes before examining those for wastes
the major contribution to informed debate about the search for sites for the disposal of nuclear wastes has come from a group of geographers openshaw et al and a gis approach to this problem can pay high dividends
the work of carver see openshaw et al ch is an interesting example
one advantage is the ability to model a range of alternatives by allowing particular criteria to enter or be omitted from the polygon overlay operation
conceptually what is offered is little more than an automated sieve mapping that planners have used for many years but the whole procedure is speeded up by many orders of magnitude using gis software
the authors examine both sites and deep repositories which use more restricted population criteria and allow offshore locations to enter
data layers include geological maps conservation areas transport routes petrochemical facilities and demographic data
as different layers are added sequentially we see how the proportion of available land shrinks pl for instance when geological criteria are set in the search for a deep repository per cent of land area remains and the addition of the population density layer reduces this to per cent
however adding a proximity to transport constraint lowers this to per cent and so on
we can not pretend gis is a solution to the political problems of negotiation and justification but at the very least the openness of the procedures goes some way towards satisfying a worried public
gis research into site selection for hazardous waste has been almost exclusively conducted in north america and has yet to be matched in the uk
jensen and christiansen working in the usa use a raster approach with a pixel resolution of m and boolean overlay to weed out particular sites such as those which are poorly drained environmentally sensitive or inaccessible see also stewart
environmental monitoring of sites for the disposal of toxic waste is of particular concern in the usa
the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla legislation of superfund requires the cleaning up of the worst landfill sites of which some had been identified by the environmental protection agency by foresman
a major worry has been the threat posed by groundwater pollution and some research has been conducted on using gis to monitor this merchant et al barringer et al von braun
this is an important topic since per cent of rural households in the usa consume only groundwater while half the us population consumes at least some groundwater merchant et al
clearly the research demands access to exceptionally good environmental data usually in three dimensions
as foresman suggests we might expect remote sensing technology to play a major role
merchant et al for example use the image processing system erdas to construct an index of vulnerability to groundwater pollution this uses variables such as depth to water table soil type slope and so on see estes et al for a similar approach
barringer et al overlay data on soil type and geology with that of groundwater quality hardness and corrosivity measures and build a linear model which shows that the background environmental variables are good predictors of the water quality indices
again a approach is used
a further example is work by von braun who uses pmap to look at exposure of organic and metallic compounds in groundwater in the vicinity of tucson airport arizona
using plume models that predict the movement of contaminants she is able to intersect the results with data on current well locations and to assess which water supply areas are worst contaminated
overlaying the results with residential location data provides maps delineating exposures for each residence in each von braun
in principle it is then possible to compare such doses with epidemiological data once again indicating a link from a hazard event to assessment of health outcomes
attention should be drawn to foresman comment that the us geological survey usgs at the eros data centre have successfully linked to a model of groundwater flow foresman
this kind of link between gis and other modelling programs is to be warmly welcomed and parallels work at the nwrrl in linking gis and air pollution plume models
natural hazards and disaster management
several studies in recent papers have shown the effectiveness of gis in mitigating the effects of major natural hazards
berke and ruch for example describe a gis for assessing the impacts of hurricanes on the texas gulf coast
hurricane damage through high winds and tidal surges causes an immense amount of destruction and poses a major threat to many coastal communities in the usa
it has been estimated for example that during the mid some million us citizens were subject to hurricane winds of over and million were subject to hurricane surge brinkman
the system described by berke and ruch is and has an interesting modelling component called slosh sea lake and overland surges from hurricanes
slosh is able to estimate still water surge by grid cell for various hurricane intensities angles of approach to the shoreline forward movement speeds and landfall locations
additional algorithms are used to model total building damage costs for each grid cell based on and rating curves
hobeika and jamei describe the massevacuation massvac simulation software designed to analyse and evaluate traffic evacuation plans given a natural disaster in an urban area
the system comprises three interrelated modules community and disaster type characteristics module population distribution module network evacuation module
the type of natural disaster determines the time period within which the road network has to be evacuated
the control and management strategies are directly correlated to each specific disaster scenario
massvac is quite flexible and various road network options are available such as traffic signal timings on the road network traffic reserved lanes for special vehicles such as those of the emergency services
hobeika and jamei have tested massvac on various evacuation scenarios for virginia beach city in order to determine evacuation times for flood and hurricane conditions
in general they suggest that the model provided reasonable and reliable evacuation times
southworth et al have enhanced the massvac model with the addition of a colour graphics module which they call mvopl
this module has been developed using ibm graphics kernel system and provides a number of display screens
the most interesting are those which portray population flows as scaled ribbons on the network diagram and evacuation shelter capacities as bar diagrams
the diagrams are updated periodically during the course of the simulation
in dry parts of the world such as australia forest and bush fires are an important natural hazard and some attention has been given to the ways in which gis might help examine their potential impacts
kessell describes a gis called preplan pristine environment planning language which is a natural area management planning and fire modelling system developed for the australian national parks and wildlife service preplan comprises four modules a simple gis a grid cell resource database a wide range of vegetation fuel fire behaviour erosion and models tabular statistical and colour graphics output system
with this system fire growth can be modelled taking into account changes in terrain fuel and temporal changes in the weather
kessell points out that uncontrollable fires are recurrent phenomena in many parts of australia causing damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars and significant loss of life
systems such as preplan can provide the user with sound models of the behaviour patterns of fire and are therefore of enormous value in planning
one of the most widespread natural hazards is flooding and the potential for loss of property risk to life and general social disruption is large
one interesting example of a gis approach to flood damage estimation is the anuflood package which was developed in the early following detailed flood damage studies for coastal towns in northern new south wales australia smith and greenaway
the anuflood system requires locational and building type data on individual properties curves relating the average damage that would result from overfloor flooding to differing depths for each property type and lastly flood frequency in terms of flood height expressed as a probability
output from the system is both tabular and graphical
of particular interest is the construction of maps showing the expected annual amounts of damage for gridded areas
anuflood also contains modules which permit the investigation of various flood damage mitigation options such as property height raising levee construction and flood proofing
environmental epidemiology
the possibilities sketched above relate to emergency planning the search for hazardous sites and risk assessment
to what extent can gis help if an event occurs
what for instance of the health consequences
there is a rich tradition of epidemiological work in geography and with the increasing availability of spatially referenced medical data the scope for gis applications is wide gatrell
for instance diggle et al assess the hypothesis that cancer of the larynx is associated with proximity to a incinerator and develop a statistical model from the theory of spatial point processes to test this
this would have been impossible without the link provided from postcoded data increasingly available from sources such as cancer registries to ordnance survey os grid references
such a link is provided by the central postcode directory which matches all million unit postcodes in the uk to grid references
when the cases of laryngeal cancer are compared with a null distribution provided by the distribution of much more common lung cancer the hypothesis is given strong support
although the proposed method is novel it is but one of an increasingly large number of methods designed to detect and model clusters of disease see for example cuzick and edwards
the work of diggle et al examined only a single point source though it generalizes to multiple sources and to linear hazards as well
as a second example of health work linked to hazard studies we may cite the research being conducted by cross on childhood leukaemia
there are numerous hypotheses concerning the aetiology of this disease from ionizing radiation to viral transmission and cross approach is to collect digital data designed to test some of these hypotheses and to use to display and analyse results
for instance one hypothesis concerns the role of electromagnetic radiation a source of which is overhead transmission lines as noted earlier
if these are digitized and buffer zones constructed around them fig we can quite easily test hypotheses about prevalence in such buffer zones as compared with prevalence outside
however we should bear in mind the earlier point about the resolution of the data since such electromagnetic effects have a very weak effect beyond perhaps m wertheimer and leeper
there has been a suspicion for many years that high rates of stomach cancer in parts of wales may be linked to soil chemistry specifically such factors as ratios and to lead content in water supplies
matthews has used data from the regional cancer registry morbidity rather than mortality data and data on trace elements to examine this link
since the latter are available for a km raster the registration data are assigned to these grid squares using the os grid reference
as with any such study there are the usual problems of ecological analysis and influences of migration together with issues of separating out the risk factors under investigation from possible confounding factors
in the usa morrill report on the beginnings of a study into the possible radiation doses received as result of radiation releases by the hanford washington state nuclear complex would seem to cry out for gis skills to be applied morrill
the research project will employ plume dispersion models in order to model dispersal by wind and will need to integrate this and other environmental data with detailed demographic records
to some extent this line of approach was anticipated by johnson in his study of exposure to plutonium from the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant near denver see zeigler et al
using soil samples he constructed a contoured risk surface and then mapped excess cancers in various distance bands detecting a marked distance decay effect
research problems and prospects
the work reviewed above suggests that the application of gis techniques to hazard assessment emergency planning and environmental monitoring is both actually and potentially an important research area with many challenging problems
undoubtedly the giss of the will look very different from their rather primitive ancestors
computer power is becoming cheaper digital data more readily available and giss are becoming hybrid systems involving other technologies
in this last section we highlight some important research areas as we see them
doubtless there are many others such is the surge of interest in gis technology
data availability
we should first consider the availability and quality of data concerning the populations who may be at risk from the storage and transport of hazardous substances from toxic air pollution from flooding and so on
such data are crucial either for assisting the emergency services to make assessments about resources they need to deploy in such events or for estimates to be made of risk
within the public domain in the uk we must rely in general on data from the most recent population census the lowest level being that for enumeration districts eds
as is well known rhind these contain on average perhaps households and people
the boundaries eds have not been widely digitized unlike the electoral wards
however the centroids of eds are available as m grid references and artificial ed polygons can be created if necessary
in some instances such data will suffice in many cases they will have to suffice as nothing better is available
but in some areas eds are very extensive physical units and the shapes will be quite distorted
furthermore the scales at which population estimates are often required means that even eds are too coarse for risk assessments
for instance in performing its quantitative risk assessments the health and safety executive will rarely deal with distances from hazardous sites in excess of km petts and census data will not offer sufficient resolution for accurate population estimates to be made
it should be pointed out however that the national radiological protection board currently uses km grid square resolution population data from the census in its radiological protection studies hallam et al
it would seem that despite the costs involved they should consider investing in the very detailed digital data pinpoint address code pac provided by pinpoint analysis ltd
this area of application would appear to be an obvious market for such a product
a useful research exercise would be to compare the use of census and pac data in deriving quantitative risk assessments and this is an interesting research problem
even with pac data some assumptions would need to be made about numbers of persons per household if good population estimates were to be made
more generally we need to consider the availability of large databases for hazard studies and emergency planning and this is an area ripe for major initiatives
in the uk we seem to be lagging well behind the usa in the construction of databases on hazardous sites and especially hazard events such as those involving toxic releases
for instance lioy and daisey in their work on the monitoring of toxic air pollution in new jersey construct what they term a microinventory for each of three towns comprising the locations of chemical plants metal processing plants paint spray manufacturers and so on
some attribute information is available for these
more closely linked to gis is work by mcmaster and johnson who perform a very detailed inventory of hazardous materials both stored and transported in santa monica california
although the raster displays are very crude it is simple to answer spatial queries concerning the locations of people for instance particular age groups within certain distances of toxic hazard sites
we have data on some hazardous sites those regulated by cimah in the uk but a much more comprehensive approach should be adopted especially if we are serious in the search for environmental associations with chronic diseases
the same is true for toxic releases
in the usa the environmental protection agency produces an acute hazards events database while the department of transportation has a database recording details of releases of toxic materials such details include locational information type and amount of material released mode of release and resulting injuries or deaths cutter and solecki
can we not use gis technology to construct risk mosaics zeigler et al at a variety of spatial scales akin to hewitt and burton hazardousness of a place
in the uk only a handful of county emergency planning departments cumbria for instance have built up resource databases in digital form and this needs to be promoted
further afield we need to recognize that some disasters most obviously chernobyl will have implications for more than one country so that environmental monitoring should take place with some kind of international
there will also be movements of hazardous cargoes across frontiers and there are clearly problems of risk assessment and planning for emergencies at or near international boundaries or at sea and airports
as noted above the work of fedra is a major step in this direction and links need to be forged between initiatives in the uk and the rest of europe
in terms of databases on hazardous wastes attention has already been drawn to the waste disposal plans prepared by wras
these give details of present site locations and some indication of permitted wastes though little or no information on closed and abandoned sites
however for details of disposal the individual site licences must be consulted
the former hazardous waste inspectorate operated a large database on all sites with details of permitted wastes including allowable quantities
the database was created by a commercial company aspinwalls ltd
there are numerous potentially usable databases for environmental epidemiological work
opcs of course is a major data repository for medical statistics and their various monitor series are of use though only at the scale of district health authority and above see gatrell and lovett for an example
regional health authorities will from time to time produce mortality data at ward level
however if cancers are of interest it is more appropriate to obtain data from regional cancer registries these data are morbidity rather than mortality data and are therefore more valuable
the data are postcoded and may have some occupational details
for example we have received data from the regional cancer registry in manchester comprising all cancers of the larynx and lung notified between and
this large data set to which grid references have now been added comprises information about nearly individuals
it has now been copied into ingres a relational database management system permitting queries to be made about subsets of the data for instance all males between the ages of and suffering from laryngeal cancer
other data sources on cancers are independent registries of malignancies
an example is that on leukaemias managed by the leukaemia research fund centre in leeds alexander et al
it should be noted that there are frequently major discrepancies between the regional registries and the specialist registries partly because the latter receive notifications directly from consultants
indeed working directly with consultants proves invaluable in gaining access to morbidity data
two other potential sources of data are worth mentioning
first attention should be drawn to the new directive from the department of health to regional and district health authorities to review the health of the population
this means in practice that district medical officers are charged with preparing an annual report presenting and interpreting epidemiological data identifying local health problems and evaluating service outcomes
lancaster university is already heavily involved in the work of preston district health authority in this area
second family health service authorities fhsas are also required to take on these roles but from the viewpoint of primary health care services
fhsas which correspond to counties and to metropolitan boroughs hold large databases on services provided by general practitioners for instance uptake of immunization and screening for breast and cervical cancers
is it we wonder possible to contemplate bringing together some of these data sources to form a national online health information system nohis to parallel that for employment and unemployment townsend et al
this might include data on morbidity and mortality uptake of preventative medicine service use and availability at both primary and hospital level
it would be a useful management tool particularly in view of the reorganization taking place in the national health service
it should not be forgotten that hazards themselves have geographical distributions yet there has been little effort in the uk to develop public domain databases
are there areas
is there a regional differentiation in hazard type
these are of course commercially important questions and a good deal of money is going into the collection of such data by insurance companies
one well known database is major hazard incident data service mhidas global industrial hazards database which is currently being developed by the safety and reliability directorate on behalf of the major hazards assessment unit of the uk health and safety directorate
this system currently runs in dbase ii and contains in excess of items of professionally assessed information on major hazards coded into some separate fields
unfortunately the spatial referencing is poor and with some effort this could easily be remedied
it is for example little use when recording a chemical spill into an egyptian river to have entered into the appropriate field the nile after all this river is some km long
here in our view is a classic case of the absence of a geographical input rendering the data of limited value
in some cases good hazard data exist but have simply not yet found their way into a gis
a case in point is inland and coastal flooding
most river authorities have detailed maps showing the geographical limits of floods in relation to their return periods
within the next decade as the privatized water companies develop their gis we shall see a massive amount of data conversion in this area
this development together with the availability of digital terrain models will allow quite sophisticated flood forecasting models to be developed within a gis framework
as rise in the next years due to the greenhouse effect this very practical use of gis technology is likely to become commonplace and of considerable practical importance
spatial statistics
another way in which there needs to be a rapprochement between statistical methods and gis is in the area of spatial sampling and estimation from spatial samples
this is clearly an important issue in radiation monitoring as the discussion of rimnet above implies
as an example peirson has reviewed the evidence on artificial radioactivity in cumbria and shows maps of the distribution of certain radionuclides as contoured surfaces
the point worth making here is that there are many alternative schemes for interpolating from irregular point data lam
one method in particular kriging now available as part of the uniras software offers not only a contoured surface but also an estimate of the standard error at any point on the map
where this is high it suggests that an additional sampling station might be set up
such techniques are now standard in environmental science see streit for an application to rainfall monitoring and need to be promoted vigorously in hazard studies estes et al
related to this problem is that of making population estimates for new zones that result from overlay operations
we may want to count numbers living within plumes circles of fixed radius buffer zones and so on
existing gis techniques usually base the estimates on shares so that a new polygon created by slicing an existing area in half is assigned half the population of that source unit
this may be quite absurd in some cases notably where population is spatially clustered within a physically large ed
at the nwrrl work is under way flowerdew and green to solve such problems using the em algorithm and the statistical modelling package glim which has been interfaced with
operations research methods and simulation
while there is some research activity in linking statistical models to gis there would seem to be scope for further applications of operations research techniques to gis problems
within some sophisticated gis such as there are some useful algorithms such as shortest path calculations but gis developers have in general failed to realize the natural links between gis functions and many operations research techniques
over the last years or so a large theoretical literature has been developed to provide tools for the solution of many problems associated with emergency planning kolesar
one important class of problems is the selection of locations for the emergency service units
the choice of locations need not be for permanent bases but can also include dynamic repositioning of units as circumstances dictate kolesar and walker
in any major emergency a typical problem is the assignment of resources to demands
if resources are held at one set of locations and the demands are at another and the costs of transportation are known how do we allocate the resources most efficiently
in a major emergency for example there might be a need to supply blood products held at regional blood banks to hospitals
this of course is the classic transportation problem and its solution is well known
as far as we know the emergency response system devised by belardo et al is the only software to incorporate this algorithm
in this system the solution to the transportation problem is shown graphically on the road network which is displayed on the computer screen
as a last example of the potential role of operations research in gis and disaster management we are reminded of the logistic problems that faced the peel regional police force during the mississauga evacuation mentioned previously scanlon and padgham
during the early states of the phased evacuation the logistical problem facing the police was the warning of the population to make ready for evacuation
speed was of the essence and manpower was limited
here then is a familiar operations research network problem all roads have to be traversed such that the journey is a minimum
this is the chinese postman problem which provides a hamiltonian circuit through the arcs as compared with the travelling salesman problem which is a minimum route through the network nodes
grant remains were shovelled into a canvas bag
tense facing outwards forster lawton and nell guarded delaney as he intoned the seaman prayer of interment and then committed the canvas bag to the ocean
the storm was abating rapidly the evening sky clearing in the west with the golden rays of the setting sun adding a dying colour to the sullen slate blue water
the whiteness of the canvas dimmed beneath the onrushing sea faded at the edges then grew smaller greener and was gone
they returned to the bridge fearful of every dark place every corner every door
the gangway lamps seemed to give no light only add further to the gloom of the dusk
back in the wheelhouse delaney faced them
right
you all know the score
as i see it we got two choices
one we get out of here now
launch the lifeboat take our chances or two we go after whatever it is
nobody spoke immediately
finally forster glanced at lawton for support and drawled laconically
i not leaving here until we done for that bastard
it personal from now on in
lawton nodded his agreement
yes he said i feel the same
nell
delaney asked looking at her squarely
i agree she said without hesitation
their tense edgy faces watched delaney closely
we do know what we up against delaney said so let proceed with maximum caution
trouble is lawton said with a frown there are enough of us to search the ship
it can work its way past us and hide again
we could still be looking for it when they blow us out of the water
that why we got to take risks nell put in
lure it into a trap somehow
and quickly
forster chuckle was mirthless
i do think this joker is going to need much encouragement
no
delaney was momentarily thoughtful
what had you in mind nell
she pointed to the figure of a man propped in the corner and the cylinders of oxygen in the back pack lying beside it
two of our number have been killed
each time when they were on their own
let give it the same conditions only this time we use that as the bait
they looked at the man forster had found
it was a safety suit an advanced model of the nbc type with its own oxygen tanks
one in ambush with the rest of us acting like beaters
start at one end of the ship making as much noise as possible
forster grunted
it had no trouble finding grant
i think it a good idea
and i go in the suit until we reach the ambush point
might help to draw it
they helped him kit up nell connecting the leads from the back pack into the suit attachments
forster breathing whistled out of the valve
behind the clear wide vizor he tried to smile
cosy in here he joked
even got my own toilet
bloody handy in the circumstances
delaney took the lead
it was now light the lamps on the gangway giving murky yellow pools that barely pushed back the inky blackness of a starless night
at the entrance to the laboratory complex the others drew on their own masks
ineffectual or not against lingering gases it seemed a wise precaution even if it was only psychological
delaney glanced back at them
let make sure it knows where we are
they made noise slammed doors
nell shuddered
were unseen eyes watching them
was it even now shadowing them moving soundlessly from cover to cover like a tiger in the steel jungle
forster voice broke into her thoughts
looks a good place
he was at the entrance to the secure lab zone
this must be the only way in nell said
forster was quickly
as they set up the now empty suit with its back to the door half slumped over a control panel he settled down behind the curtained entrance of the showers
delaney voice was hushed
maybe we should leave two of us here
do want to rouse any suspicions
forster was adamant
after all it might be able to count
when he did get any response he patted the uzi beside him on the steel floor
i wo be unprepared like poor old grant
delaney pulled the curtain across covering forster who cut a small slit in the opaque green plastic widening it to give himself a better field of view
lawton came and crouched down in front of it
i left the suit radio on full he said
make it sound interesting if we talk occasionally
he hesitated
good luck
i feel like a maharajah waiting for the tiger to pounce on the goat forster grinned
i hope i do have to wait all night
nell shuddered
night
this was a night in their minds a creature from the darker side of man intellect
something worried her about that thought
something hidden behind the more obvious sentiment
after they gone forster felt the silence physically settle around him
he never been one to exercise an yet the conditions were like the feeling of a tomb of an interment
would he be found he mused a thousand years from then a skeleton
he chuckled
and the uzi a primitive weapon the bio suit mistaken for some sort of ceremonial armour
the first stunning silence gave way to the creaking of the ship and a booming of the sea against the hull
the radio on the dummy suddenly screeched into action as delaney distorted voice gave it life
the thousands of tons of steel made real communication impossible
his own radio was off
forster settled down only putting his eye to the slit every half minute not continually as he had started to do
he had a good view of the long shadowy main corridor
the only problem was if he corrected himself when it came which side turning if any would it use
the further away the better
the more time to see it approach
the trouble was the transverse corridor just outside the room
if the approach was that way he would get no warning at all and it would be on top of george his name for the dummy sitting like a drunken before he knew it
if that happened he have to work fast
what he seen done to grant made forster realise that whatever it was struck with demonic speed and savagery
or on him
as if in protest george uttered a cackle and fell fractionally forward
forster suppressed a nervous giggle
they reached the main deck dropping down
in a defensive posture eyes searching the stacked containers trying to probe the black jagged recesses between them
lawton scanned upwards
it could be anywhere
even back on the bridge again
we should start in the engine room nell suggested shivering work up through the crew quarters and then into the complex
confronted with the need to proceed
delaney took risks plummeting feet first through the hatchways and partly breaking his descent with the handrails falling like a parachutist rolling instantly deploying his uzi against
against what
like forster all he could guess was that it was fast
grant may have been lame but fast or silent
or both
the speed of descent must have cut down the exposure to any residual gas since he felt none of the earlier weirdness as he approached the still sealed engine room door
pandora box
he winced at the memory as he hammered on the steel and then looked through the spy port
in the stroboscopic view the giant pistons were the only things moving until a figure detached itself from the wall its grey colour exactly that of the background steel
like a chameleon it moved out of the aisle between machines then stopped and became utterly motionless
delaney stillness caught the attention of the others
nell transceivered voice crackled in his headphones
what is it
he did want to take his eyes from it equally he wanted somebody else to see it
to confirm
gently as though he might disturb it he pulled back
take a look for yourself
she did and caught her breath
the creature was absurdly so its body half man half something lost in the primordial past
but there could be no doubt that fundamentally it was human
nell knew and not only because she was a female of the same species
she could see in its eyes intelligence
and human fear
but also as a doctor she knew exactly what it was
she told delaney who shook his head with revulsion
nell would never rest until she could get closer to confirm her worst suspicions and paradoxically it was the woman in her that provided the intensity of emotion that would let nothing stand in her way
george the sacrificial dummy had emitted a squeak for a long time
forster scanned the corridor once more
it was empty
just as it always had been
he sat back again eyeing the blank wall before him confident that he catch it however good it was
he kept wondering how it had got silk
silk was the meanest toughest professional he ever known
and yet he disappeared without trace
forster was a fatalist
he shrugged
you could be james bond he thought but if something had your number on it
a gentle breeze broke the absolute silence moving the curtain so that he had to steady it with his hand
instantly alert forster checked through his spy port
nothing
but a door had opened somewhere
somebody or something had entered the complex
it could be the others returning or the start of his ambush
for god sake leave your mask on
and that an order
but delaney plea was in vain
nell pulled it off got close to the door and shouted
we mean you no harm
you can help us
when she checked through the spyhole it was standing in exactly the same spot unmoving like a lizard
lawton shook his head
ca hear you
try the ship system again
nell ran to the wall telephone and pushed the digit for engine room
the small light beneath the receiver rests showed that the line was working
worried delaney followed searching her face fearing the signs of toxicity
on impulse and against his better judgment he pulled off his own mask
nell repeatedly pressed the button shouted across at lawton who was now using the spy port
what happening
the back of lawton head shook his voice crackling
nothing now
the head jerked just the once to the left so i reckon it heard the phone
he straightened up and came over directing his question at delaney
we ought to get on
delaney nodded his agreement
leave it nell
his tone was sharp
it not going anywhere
she squared up to him defiantly
i ca john
do you see
the poor thing is part of this madness
if we can get to it i can learn so much more
and in any case it might die if we do try and help it soon
delaney averted his gaze from her afraid of what he had seen in her eyes
perhaps it would be better if it did
you do mean that she said stepping away from him
delaney fiddled awkwardly with his mask preparatory to putting it back on again
for god sake nell
all i mean is we got a job to do
and forster neck on the line
do you owe it to him to come now
she flushed but held on to the phone
obviously striving to be as controlled as possible she smiled
you two can manage she said calmly
i can do better here on my own
quietly
if i succeed it will unlock a lot of the mystery of what been done on titron
and
she faltered
i think we owe it to that pathetic creature in there
pathetic
delaney tried to play down the fear in his voice fear for her
it might be bloody dangerous
certainly something on this ship is
not this one nell said shaking her head with some kind of reassurance
i just know
lawton gestured in the gangway
you may not be at risk from what is in here
what about out there
there no guarantee that what we hunting is going to follow the rules
nell shrugged
that a risk i have to take
i got a more important job here
delaney knew there was no way she would be shifted from her chosen course
ordering her would be ludicrous under the changed circumstances and in any event a waste of time
but lawton was right
the risk from the other danger or dangers of titron frightened him more
help me secure the stairs behind us he snapped at lawton as much as we can
delaney turned to nell
it might buy you the time you need
but take care
do be bloody foolish like i am leaving you here
establish contact if you can
no more at this stage
understand
and do try and get the door open
but nell was hardly listening
to please him she nodded then despite lawton presence squeezed delaney arm
and you
she smiled
watch out
reluctantly delaney made for the gangway
lawton had already shifted some chairs in readiness to form a barricade
he gave him a hand with a large oil drum and then another as nell tearing herself from her appointed task dragged over a bench
as they drew back up the stairs piling on the pieces she threw up at them lawton sniffed
this wo hold anything
just slow it down
like forster before her nell indicated her pistol and grenades
as long as there ti me that all we need
as they descended the stairs delaney paused and took a last look down at her
she smiled shyly then turned away
in a sense as long as he could convince himself that she was safe he was glad she was coming with them
whatever it was they were after it was an unknown quantity unknown that is except for a lethal ferocity
he pulled on his respirator his mind made up to get back to her as soon as he could for nell anderson was all he cared about now
there it went again
forster frowned as he looked through his spy hole
a sound
he could place it but it reminded him strongly of something
the corridor was empty
it had happened three times now
a hissing we gas escaping ending with a funny little squeak
he looked at george wondering if the sound had come from him
satisfied that everything was as it should be he checked his watch
well over half an hour had passed
they ought to be near him soon
forster searched in a pouch and came up with a glucose sweet
quietly he unwrapped the covering paper then paused as some instinct made him check again
as he did so the sound came nearer louder
his intense scrutiny took in the shadowy and empty lengths of the corridor
apart from some dark patches on the wall that he had noticed before there was nothing to see
his gaze came back to george still sprawled over the control desk
a fly landed on the empty staring vizor and crawled across it
forster was sorely tempted to nip out and confirm that the noise was coming from george by twiddling the volume and tuner but fought down the urge
he sat back pulled off his mask and popped the sweet into his mouth
it took him only seconds to notice the smell
forster choked as the putrefying reek seemed to get right into him
frightened that it was a gas pocket he fumbled with his mask and finally got it back on
his heart was thumping
nothing seemed to be happening all his senses were apparently functioning normally except that the sweet in his mouth seemed permeated with the awful smell had become a slimy lump of filth
he had to get rid of it
forster reached for his mask just as the hissing gas noise sounded right on top of him ending with a little shriek
he knew then where he heard something similar before
it was like a man breathing through a respiratory system with some sort of valve
a shadow fell across the wall opposite as slowly and fearfully he turned
the curtain was a dense opaque and something was right behind it a shape pressing against the humped plastic standing there looking down at him half seen half imagined
his hand went out reached for the submachine gun his fingers tightening on the stock
with a growl the curtain was snatched aside
forster half rolled his uzi trembling in his hand as he got off half a clip at point blank range
but it struck with the speed of an attacking snake
and something else something he saw as the curtain tore away and he looked into the depths of the unbelievable face above him fractionally dulled his reflexes
friday september to tuesday september
once free of the knotted tentacles of the eastern suburbs dalgliesh made good time and by three he was driving through lydsett village
here a right turn took him off the coastal road on to what was little more than a smoothly macadamed track bordered by ditches and fringed by a golden haze of reeds their lumbered heads straining in the wind
and now for the first time he thought that he could smell the north sea that potent but tang evoking nostalgic memories of childhood holidays of solitary adolescent walks as he struggled with his first poems of his aunt tall figure at his side binoculars round her neck striding towards the haunts of her beloved birds
and here barring the road was the familiar old farm gate still in place
its continued presence always surprised him since it served no purpose that he could see except symbolically to cut off the headland and to give travellers pause to consider whether they really wanted to continue
it swung open at his touch but closing it as always was more difficult and he lugged and half lifted it into place and slipped the circle of wire over the gatepost with a familiar sensation of having turned his back on the workaday world and entered country which no matter how frequent his visits would always be alien territory
he was driving now across the open headland towards the fringe of pine trees which bordered the north sea
the only house to his left was the old victorian rectory a square building incongruous behind its struggling hedge of rhododendron and laurel
to his right the ground rose gently towards the southern cliffs and he could see the dark mouth of a concrete pillbox undemolished since the war and as seemingly indestructible as the great hulks of concrete remnants of the old fortifications which lay in the sand along part of the beach
to the north the broken arches and stumps of the ruined benedictine abbey gleamed golden in the afternoon sun against the crinkled blue of the sea and breasting a small ridge he glimpsed for the first time the topsail of larksoken mill and beyond it against the skyline the great grey bulk of larksoken nuclear power station
the road he was on veering left would lead eventually to the station but was he knew seldom used since normal traffic and all heavy vehicles used the new access road to the north
the headland was empty and almost bare the few straggling trees distorted by the wind struggled to keep their precarious hold in the uncompromising soil
and now he was passing a second and more dilapidated pillbox and it struck him that the whole headland had the desolate look of an old battlefield the corpses long since carted away but the air vibrating still with the gunfire of battles while the power station loomed over it like a grandiose modern monument to the unknown dead
on his previous visits to larksoken he had seen martyr cottage spread out beneath him when he and his aunt had stood surveying the headland from the small top room under the cone of the mill
but he had never been closer to it than the road and now driving up to it it struck him again that the description cottage was hardly appropriate
it was a substantial house standing to the east of the track with walls partly flint and partly rendered enclosing at the rear a courtyard of york stone which gave an uninterrupted view over fifty yards of scrub to the grassy dunes and the sea
no one appeared as he drew up and before lifting his hand to the bell he paused to read the words of a stone plaque embedded in the flints to the right of the door
in a cottage on this site lived agnes poley protestant martyr burned at ipswich august aged years
ecclesiastes chapter verse
the plaque was unadorned the letters deeply carved in an elegant script reminiscent of eric gill and dalgliesh remembered his aunt telling him that it had been placed there by previous owners in the late twenties when the cottage was originally extended
one of the advantages of a religious education is the ability to identify at least the texts of scripture and this was one which it needed no effort of memory to recall
as a delinquent at his prep school he had once been required by the headmaster to write out in his best handwriting the whole of the third chapter of ecclesiastes old gumboil economical in this as in all matters believing that writing lines should combine punishment with literary and religious education
the words in that round childish script had remained with him
it was he thought an interesting choice of text
that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been and god requireth that which is past
he rang and there was only a short delay before alice mair opened the door
he saw a tall handsome woman dressed with careful and expensive informality in a black cashmere sweater with a silk scarf at the throat and fawn trousers
he would have recognized her from her strong resemblance to her brother although she looked the elder by some years
she took it for granted that each knew who the other was and standing aside to motion him in she said it good of you to be so accommodating mr dalgliesh
i afraid nora gurney is implacable
once she knew you were on your way to norfolk you were a predestined victim
perhaps you would bring the proofs through to the kitchen
it was a distinguished face with the widely spaced eyes beneath straight brows a rather secretive mouth and strong greying hair swept upwards and curled into a chignon
in her publicity photographs she could he recalled look beautiful in a somewhat intimidating intellectual and very english mould
but seen face to face even in the informality of her own house the absence of a spark of sexuality and he sensed a reserve made her seem less feminine and more formidable than he had expected and she held herself stiffly as if repelling invaders of her personal space
the handshake with which she had greeted him had been cool and firm and her brief smile was surprisingly attractive
he knew that he was oversensitive to the timbre of the human voice and hers although not jarring or unpleasant sounded a little forced as if she were deliberately speaking at an unnatural pitch
he followed her down the hall to the kitchen at the back of the house
it was he judged almost twenty feet long and obviously served the triple purpose of sitting room working place and office
the half of the room was a kitchen with a large gas stove and an aga a butcher chopping block a dresser to the right of the door holding an assortment of gleaming pots and a long working surface with a wooden triangle sheathing her assortment of knives
in the centre of the room was a large wooden table holding a stoneware jar of dried flowers
on the wall was a working fireplace the two recesses fitted with bookshelves
to each side of the hearth was a wicker armchair in an intricate closely woven design fitted with patchwork cushions
there was an open desk facing one of the wide windows and to its right a stable door the top half open gave a view of the paved courtyard
dalgliesh could glimpse what was obviously her herb garden planted in elegant terracotta pots carefully disposed to catch the sun
the room which contained nothing superfluous nothing pretentious was both pleasing and extraordinarily comforting and for a moment he wondered why
was it the faint smell of herbs and newly baked dough the soft ticking of the clock which seemed both to mark the passing seconds and yet to hold time in thrall the rhythmic moaning of the sea through the door the sense of ease conveyed by the two cushioned armchairs the open hearth
or was it that the kitchen reminded dalgliesh of that rectory kitchen where the lonely only child had found warmth and undemanding uncensorious companionship been given hot dripping toast and small forbidden treats
he placed the proofs on the desk refused alice mair offer of coffee and followed her back to the front door
she walked out with him to the car and said i was sorry about your aunt sorry for you i mean
i expect that for an ornithologist death ceases to be terrible once sight and hearing begin to go
and to die in one sleep without distress to oneself or inconvenience to others is an enviable end
but you had known her for so long that she must have seemed immortal
formal condolences he thought were never easy to speak or accept and usually sounded either banal or insincere
hers had been perceptive
jane dalgliesh had indeed seemed to him immortal
the very old he thought make our past
once they go it seems for a moment that neither it nor we have any real existence
he said i do think death was ever terrible to her
i not sure that i really knew her and i left wishing i tried harder
but i shall miss her
alice mair said i did know her either
perhaps i should have tried harder too
she was a very private woman i suspect one of those fortunate people who find no other company more agreeable than their own
it always seems presumptuous to encroach on that
perhaps you share it
but if you can tolerate company i having a few people mostly colleagues of alex from the power station to dinner on thursday night
would you care to join us
seven thirty for eight
it sounded he thought more like a challenge than an invitation
somewhat to his surprise dalgliesh found himself accepting
but then the whole encounter had been a little surprising
she stood regarding him with a serious intensity as he let in the clutch and turned the car and he had the impression that she was watching critically to see how he handled it
but at least he thought as he gave a final wave she had asked him whether he had come to norfolk to help catch the whistler
three minutes later he raised his foot from the accelerator
ahead of him trudging along on the left of the path was a little group of children the eldest girl wheeling a pushchair with two smaller children one each side of her clutching the bars
hearing the noise of the car she turned and he saw a peaked delicate face framed with hair
he recognized the blaney children met once before with their mother walking along the beach
obviously the eldest girl had been shopping the folding pushchair had a shelf under the seat lumped high with plastic bags
instinctively he slowed down
they were unlikely to be in real danger the whistler stalked at night not in broad daylight and no vehicle had passed him since he left the coastal road
but the child looked grossly overburdened and ought not to be so far from home
though he had never seen their cottage he seemed to remember that his aunt had told him that it lay about two miles to the south
he recalled what he knew about them that their father earned a precarious living as a painter whose innocuous prettified watercolours were sold in and tourist shops along the coast and that their mother had been desperately ill with cancer
he wondered whether mrs blaney was still alive
his instinct was to pile the children into the car and drive them home but that he knew was hardly sensible
almost certainly the eldest child theresa was it had been taught not to accept lifts from strangers particularly men and he was virtually a stranger
on an impulse he reversed the jaguar and drove quickly back to martyr cottage
this time the front door was open and a swathe of sunlight lay across the floor
alice mair had heard the car and came out to him from the kitchen wiping her hands
he said the blaney children are walking home
theresa is wheeling a pushchair and trying to cope with the twins
i thought i could offer a lift if i had a woman with me someone they know
she said briefly they know me
without another word she went back into the kitchen then came out to him closed the front door after her without locking it and got into the car
putting it into gear his arm brushed her knee
he was aware of an almost imperceptible withdrawing more emotional than physical a small delicate gesture of
dalgliesh doubted whether that recoil had anything to do with him personally nor did he find her silence disconcerting
their conversation when they did speak was brief
he asked is mrs blaney still alive
no
she died six weeks ago
how are they managing
not particularly well i imagine
but ryan blaney does welcome interference
i sympathize
once he lets down his defences half the social workers in norfolk amateur and professional will move in on him
when they drew up beside the little band it was alice mair who opened the car door and spoke
theresa here is mr dalgliesh to give you all a lift
he miss dalgliesh nephew from larksoken mill
one of the twins had better sit on my lap
the rest of you and the pushchair can fit into the back
theresa looked at dalgliesh without smiling and said a grave thank you
she reminded him of pictures of the young elizabeth tudor the same hair framing a curiously adult face both secretive and the same sharp nose and wary eyes
the faces of the twins softer editions of her own turned towards her questioningly then broke into shy smiles
they looked as if they had been dressed in a hurry and not very suitably for a long walk on the headland even in a warm autumn
one wore a tattered summer dress in pink spotted cotton with double flounces the other a pinafore over a checked blouse
their pathetically thin legs were unprotected
theresa was wearing jeans and a grubby sweat shirt with a map of london underground across the front
dalgliesh found himself wondering if it had been brought back from a school trip to the capital
it was too large for her and the wide sleeves of limp cotton hung from her freckled arms like rags thrown over a stick
in contrast to his sisters anthony was a bundle of leggings jumper and a padded jacket topped with a woollen helmet with a bobble pulled well down over his forehead beneath which he surveyed their busyness unsmiling like a stout imperious caesar
dalgliesh got out of the jaguar and tried to extricate him from the pushchair but the anatomy of the chair momentarily defeated him
there was a bar beneath which the child rigid legs were obstinately stuck
the solid uncooperative bundle was surprisingly heavy it was like trying to manoeuvre a firm and rather smelly poultice
theresa gave him a brief pitying smile dragged the plastic bags from beneath the seat then expertly freed her brother and settled him on her left hip while with the other hand she collapsed the pushchair with a single vigorous shake
dalgliesh took the baby from her while theresa helped the children into the jaguar and commanded with sudden fierceness sit still
anthony recognizing incompetence grasped dalgliesh hair firmly with a sticky hand and he felt the momentary touch of a cheek so soft that it was like the fall of a petal
throughout these manoeuvrings alice mair sat quietly watching from the car but made no move to help
it was impossible to know what she was thinking
but once the jaguar had moved away she turned to theresa and said in a voice of surprising gentleness does your father know that you out alone
daddy has taken the van to mr sparks
it due for its mot test
mr sparks does think it going to pass
and i found we run out of milk for anthony
we have to have milk
and we wanted some more disposable nappies
alice mair said i giving a dinner party on thursday evening
if your father agrees would you like to come and help with the table like you did last month
what are you going to cook miss mair
put your head close so that i can whisper
mr dalgliesh is going to be one of the guests
i want it to be a surprise
the pale golden head leaned forward towards the grey and miss mair whispered
theresa smiled and then nodded with serious satisfaction in a moment of grave feminine conspiracy
but next morning ruth awakened early and leaving miss beard to her gentle dreams dressed quickly and hurried out of the house
it was another golden day
she still retained her english habit of noting each day weather always expecting changes marvelling at the hot sunny days which followed one after the other almost with monotony
when she reached the plateau she remained standing watching for joss barnet waiting for the moment when she would see him riding towards her
there was no longer any need for her to be
discovered
her sole purpose in being there was to meet him and she was content that he should know it
he was late this morning
or was she earlier than she thought
had she misjudged the time
no matter
she was happy to wait for him certain that soon she would see him riding towards her
then as the minutes passed and there was no sign of him she considered that perhaps he had overslept
it could happen
or had his horse gone lame cast a shoe
she sat down and prepared to wait as long as was necessary
she knew that in the end he would come
after a few more minutes she became restless and stood up again her eyes searching the slope of the hillside and the valley below trying to determine whether some small movement down there was a man on horseback or merely a trick of her imagination
should she set off down the hill to meet him
but perhaps he would come by another route and then she would miss him
at the end of what she reckoned must be an hour she faced the fact that he was not coming
she dropped to the ground again and lay down burying her face in the grass
she had been mistaken ever to think that he would come
she had let her overwhelming desire feed her imagination had read something into his words his looks his actions which had not been there at all
her face burned with the shame of it
such was the feeling joss barnet had aroused in her that not for one moment did it occur to her to blame him for anything
it was all her fault
sick at heart she wept
then she dried her eyes on the hem of her petticoat and went slowly back to the house
so you decided to put in an appearance
cook said
i do seem to recall something about you offering to help me with the party preparations
but of course if you changed your mind
i have ruth snapped
i ready to start now
i do want any breakfast

what the matter with everyone this morning
cook demanded
there sean and the master left in a hurry this hour past for new york city both without a bite inside them and now you
gone to new york
that what i said
with mrs cranbrook words ruth appetite immediately returned
so he had not failed her after all
how could she have thought that he would
something unforeseen and urgent had happened since sean had obviously known of it yesterday afternoon and there had been no opportunity for him to inform her
relief surged through her like a physical infusion of new blood
i changed my mind she said
i would like some breakfast
suddenly i hungry
when will they be back
sean
how should i know
i do understand business
what i do understand is that if the master not home for the party tomorrow the mistress wo be pleased and that putting it mildly
do you dawdle over your breakfast then not if you intend to make yourself useful
there plenty to be done
ruth worked all that day as though she had the strength of ten
they prepared chicken pies the pastry as light as ruth heart turtle soup a haunch of venison jellies blancmanges syllabubs trifles and a host of other dishes with still more to be done on the day of the party itself
mrs cranbrook unbent so far as to show approval
you done very well she conceded
mrs carson knowing how much was involved had excused ruth from all other duties until anna bedtime hour
and now it approached
she took off the voluminous apron cook had lent her and went in search of her charge
anna was in tears
we going home she sobbed
i do want to go back to mrs gutermann
i want to stay with edward
i want to live with him for ever and ever
ruth could think of few worse fates but her stomach lurched at the thought of leaving millfield
how do you know we leaving she asked
who told you
miss fitch anna wailed
i do like miss fitch
i hate her
i daresay she wants me to go
perhaps she mistaken ruth said though she doubted if miss fitch was ever wrong
we ask your mama the moment she comes in
i afraid it true mrs carson told them
of course we were only invited for ten days or so
ruth had lost count of time
to her the long summer days had stretched ahead world without end
we are going to leave on sunday mrs carson went on
not too early in the day since i daresay we shall all be tired after tomorrow party
anna tells me she never wants to leave edward ruth said after the child had gone to sleep
mrs carson smiled indulgently
dearest anna
she a little young for a holiday infatuation but we all have them sooner or later
thank goodness they never last
and the more intense they are the shorter the duration so anna should soon be over it
will mr barnet be back for the party
ruth asked
i expect you mean will be back mrs carson said
and the answer is i do know
mrs barnet tells me that she expects her husband when she sees him
it a fact that american men seem to put business before everything
thank goodness englishmen are not like that
next morning ruth was down in the kitchen early eagerly hoping to find sean there
he could well have returned late at night and she not heard him though she had stayed awake for a long time listening for the sound of the horses the carriage wheels on the drive
there was no sign of sean but mrs cranbrook was already at work
i hope you ready to help me she said
everybody is busy with this and that as if food was the most important thing
i help mrs cranbrook ruth agreed
they not back then
she tried to sound nonchalant
not back
oh you mean and the master
not that i know of
there no telling when they u return
sometimes they gone for three or four days at a time
but surely with the party
mrs cranbrook shrugged
he a law unto himself the master
not for the likes of you and me to question why
the heart had gone out of the day
ruth fetched and carried and stirred and whipped praying every moment that joss barnet would return before they left millfield next day
but when the day had dragged to evening in spite of all there was to do the time now passed slowly and still there was no sign of the two men she began to lose hope
in the evening she left the kitchen and went to put a reluctant anna to bed
then she turned to helping mrs carson
she brushed her mistress hair and piled it on top of her head in a cluster of curls carefully and meticulously arranged to look quite casual
it was a style ruth had devised herself and mrs carson was delighted with the result
it looks so different she said
you really are quite clever at this ruth
and now for my dress
she looked beautiful in the yellow satin the bodice tight against her slight figure the skirt billowing out
but ruth had no heart either to appreciate or to envy her mistress
her spirits were at their lowest ebb
mrs carson gave her maid a sharp compassionate look
she thought she knew the cause of this mood and in a way she was glad to see it
at least it showed that the girl mind was working in the right direction
do worry ruth she said kindly
i dare say will be back tomorrow before we leave
and if not there is always new york when the barnets return in the fall
and now i sha need you again this evening so apart from looking in on anna from time to time you may do just as you please
had she not been so downhearted ruth would have enjoyed herself
but she had given up all hope of joss barnet returning that evening and nothing else in the world mattered
the party scene was pretty enough
coloured lanterns hung in the trees which fringed the lawn and bordered the lake beyond
torchlights flaring against the night sky and reflected in the water had been set up wherever it was suitable
already the orchestra had begun to play and the elegantly dressed to appear
ruth had no heart for it
she climbed the stairs to her room then undressed and went to bed wetting the pillow with her tears which held back all day now flowed unchecked
her only comfort was not to have miss beard in her room to be able to suffer in solitude
though she thought sleep would never come eventually it did
she fell asleep to the sound of music drifting upwards from the
when she wakened it was still dark the orchestra still playing though it was not that which had aroused her
penetrating her sleep she had heard the faint click of the door latch and then the familiar squeak of the hinge as the door to her room slowly opened
she raised herself on one elbow blinking her eyes trying to see in the darkness
but enough light came from the landing on to which the door opened to silhouette the man standing there
it was joss barnet
shock made her cry out and he closed the door and moved towards her in quick strides putting his hand across her mouth to scream
then he sat on her bed and without a word from either of them she went willingly into his arms and was held close in his embrace
she felt his heart beating strong and fast against hers
they stayed like that for a long moment and then he said light the candle
i ca she whispered
someone will see the light under the door
no matter if they do he said
they will not think of me here
only my coachman knows i am home
i have not yet joined the party
you came to me first
she could hardly believe it
he would not tell her this funny bewitching little english girl that he had come to her first because he could not keep away from her
she had been on his mind since the morning he had seen her from his horse frightened yet defiant sparking with anger
almost but not quite she had come between him and the work he had had to do in new york city
the moment the work was done he had ordered his coachman to drive him back to millfield as fast as the horses would go
light the candle he repeated
ruth fingers trembled as she obeyed him
then she lay back on her pillow and they looked at each other as if it was for the first time
he traced the contours of her face with gentle fingers outlining the curve of her mouth stroking her temples
without any hurry in spite of the impatience which had brought him here he caressed the length of her neck and the slope of her shoulders
from out of nowhere ruth remembered dick parker but not this time the pleasure of her union with him only the pain it had brought her on the christmas eve following
and now although her whole body cried out for fulfilment and she longed for joss barnet to complete what he had surely come to do she knew that she must not let it happen
she turned her face away from him pushed his hand from her
no she cried
you must not
he gave not the slightest sign of having heard her continuing to stroke her neck and now inserting his fingers under the neckline of her nightshift
she tried again to push him away
please
please do she cried
it was surprise which made him stop for a second
he smiled at her an unexpectedly tender smile
i wo hurt you he said
do be afraid
i not afraid of being hurt
then what
i afraid of afterwards she said hesitantly
if i were to have a child
it would be the end of the world for me
but you wo he assured her
i see to that
i not totally callous
you promise
i promise
she lay quiescent and felt his strong fingers quicker now move to unfasten the buttons of her shift one by one
and when he had undone her gown and had difficulty in lifting it over her head she raised herself from the pillow and helped him to take it off
then he pulled down the sheet which was all the bedclothes she had needed on that warm night and she lay naked before him
she observed him without shame as he looked at every part of her
her pleasure was in him and in his delight of her
when at last he stripped off his clothes and came into her it was as if this was the moment to which all her life had been leading
he was a skilful lover tender and gentle in the beginning then powerful persistent rough almost until his passion rising in harmony with hers the climax came like the bursting of a thousand stars like the beginning and ending of the world
afterwards they lay quietly side by side not speaking until he said i must go
not yet she begged
you ca leave me yet
she turned over and lay on top of him trying to pin him down with her own slight weight and he began to fondle her and she him and almost at once they were making love again
you are a sorceress he told her when it was all over
an enchantress
women as tempting as you should be kept out of the sight of mortal men
you not a mortal man ruth said
you a god
he laughed out loud
hush she cautioned
someone will hear you
i a real man all right he said
as i just proved to you
and would again if time allowed
then he stood up and quickly began to dress
i must go and do my duty as a host for what left of the night
do leave me she begged
please stay
he looked at her in surprise spoke brusquely
but of course i must go
there no question
long afterwards ruth realised that this was the moment when she had learned that she could never come first with him
however much he might desire her she would have no more than the allotted space in his life
when am i going to see you again she asked
that also was the wrong thing to say
i ca make plans he said sharply
but we leave tomorrow she exclaimed
that took him by surprise
the deuce you do
well i shall see to that
my wife will extend the invitation to the carsons
i take it they not promised elsewhere
oh no ruth said
we going back to new york city
he finished dressing then came and held her by the shoulders kissing her lightly on the mouth
as he was leaving he turned around and threw a small box on to the bed
from the city he said
you see that i had you in my mind
he was out of the room before she could open the box a dark blue leather affair lined with white velvet against which lay a fine gold chain with a small oval locket set around the edge with seed pearls
she gasped in amazement
it was without doubt the most beautiful thing she had ever owned or ever would
such delicacy such refinement
her fingers trembling with excitement she fastened it around her neck
it should remain there for ever
she would never take it off
ellen and i lingered on in mama sipcott for another hour and a half indulging in the sailor shorebound pastime of planning the perfect voyage
we decided that masquerade would sail from the bahamas to panama and thence to the galapagos where we would find darwin giant tortoises
then we would sail south to easter island to explore the mysterious statues before going to the mutineers refuge on pitcairn island
after that we would go to tahiti and i saw the excitement grow in ellen as she realised that these plans were so close to coming true
it was an excitement that matched my own for i had never sailed the south seas and i had long dreamed of that scatter of tiny magically named islands strewn across one third of a globe
by the time we had drunk our third bottle of wine ellen and i had long reached new zealand and were already sailing north towards new caledonia
we were happy
we caught the bus back to ellen apartment and collected her clothes and notebooks
she was moving back on board wavebreaker in preparation for the next day early departure
i carried her luggage to the yard noting that even ellen strident feminism evaporated in the face of two heavy bags and tropical heat
once in the boatyard ellen ran ahead of me evidently eager to reach wavebreaker air conditioning
then as she reached the dock edge she suddenly checked
what on earth is that
oh no
she began to run again
when i reached the water edge i understood her dismay
a large boat was moored alongside wavebreaker but moored so crudely that whoever had brought the powerboat alongside the schooner had not bothered to put out fenders but instead had gouged long ugly gashes in wavebreaker white paint
yet even the gashes were not so ugly as the expensive boat that had caused them
there was nothing wrong with the boat lines which were sleekly functional but her long powerful hull her upperworks and even the interior of her capacious working deck had all been painted with a wartime dazzle paint
the seemingly random and pattern of blue black silver green and white had been designed to disguise a boat shape from the prying eyes of captains so it seemed somewhat fanciful to thus camouflage a pleasure boat in the bahamas
this boat was called dream baby and she was clearly an expensive infant for rods and and outriggers splayed from her upperworks like the antennae of some outlandish insect
she boasted a harpoon walkway a flybridge and above the highest an aluminium canopy which held a radar aerial
the fighting chair on her aft deck had thick white leather straps giving it the appearance of a padded electric chair while the dazzle paint gave the boat an oddly military look that was completed by the number that was painted on her bows in black numerals like those warships use to display their commissioning numbers
the boat windscreens were made of black polarised glass which only added to dream baby ugly air of menace
ellen unencumbered with luggage had already reached wavebreaker and taken two plastic fenders from a locker
she swung lithely down to dream baby gaudily painted deck and cushioned the two hulls
how bad is the damage
i called down to her when i reached wavebreaker
it scraped back to bare metal
i give it some paint
wavebreaker hull was made of steel and while such hulls are marvellously strong and safe they are soon weakened if their steel is exposed to salt air
i had to paint the gashes as soon as possible so that rust would not begin to bite into wavebreaker long sleekness
ellen looked around the oddly painted powerboat
you think someone rich enough to own a rig like this could afford a pair of fenders
who cares
just cut the damn boat loose i said vengefully
ellen ignored my advice while i obedient to the rule that if a job needed doing then do it without delay found a pot of white paint and dug through the locker for a clean brush
then from behind me an unfamiliar voice sounded oh ring my bells
it was a man voice drawling and lazy
i twisted around and almost blinded myself by staring straight into the sun but then through the dizzying glare i made out the long silhouette of a tall man who seemed incongruously to be dressed in a long transparent dressing gown
he was emerging in stately fashion from wavebreaker companionway and though i could see he was tall and lanky and had a ponytail of hair i could make out no details of his face
who the hell are you
i demanded
the man ignored me walking instead towards ellen who dressed only in shorts and was climbing over wavebreaker rail
be still my restless heart the man had a strong caressing voice and the slow luscious accent of america deep south
dear lady dear lady to think that i might have lived my whole life through and never seen you
oh lay me down just lay me down
ellen usually so quick with a scornful reply just stood and stared at the elegant stranger who stopped one pace away from her took her hand then bowed above her fingers
he kissed the air a fastidiously polite inch above her knuckles then closed his eyes
dear sweet lord above i do thank thee for thy kindness in showing me this lovely woman before i died
to my astonishment and chagrin ellen left her hand in his as he opened his eyes and smiled at her
my name he stroked her with his voice is jesse isambard sweetman
and who dear creature are you
ellen still said nothing
i had straightened up and moved aside so that the sun no longer dazzled me and i could see sweetman properly and what i saw i did not like
his face was old and young sardonic and knowing amused and handsome the face of a man who has seen the world wickedness and knows how to match it with his own
his long black hair was tied into its ponytail with a velvet ribbon his skin was parchment pale and his eyes dark
i put his age at forty but even among men twenty years younger he would have been accounted handsome and he knew it for his expression showed both confidence and amusement as he continued to hold ellen hand and he showed even more amusement when she suddenly realised just what liberty she was thus granting him and jerked her fingers swiftly away
thus released jesse sweetman turned to look at me
the dressing gown had proved to be a long stylish duster coat which was loosely woven from a delicate white cotton
beneath the filmy topcoat he wore a black shirt and black trousers that were tucked into tall black boots
it was a dramatic and impractical outfit of a kind i only expected to see on the male models who posed in the more outlandish fashion magazines that our rich clients brought aboard wavebreaker yet jesse isambard sweetman managed to wear the elaborate style with an elegant insouciance
the only incongruous note was a cheap round badge enamelled in red and yellow that he wore on his shirt which bore the legend just say no
you must be nicholas breakspear he said carelessly as though he did not much care whether i was or not
is that gaudy piece of junk your boat
i gestured to where dream baby aerials showed above wavebreaker gunwale
sweetman turned and pretended to notice the boat for the first time
no he said helpfully then bestowed a patronising smile on me
you look so like your father
it really uncanny
did you bring that boat here
i persevered
oh indeed i did he said brightly as though he merely indulged a rather dim child curiosity
your mother was malise fielding am i right
or are you lucy de sills son
why the hell did you use fenders when you tied alongside
he sighed intimating what a bore i was being
i did not use fenders breakspear because i despise precautions
precautions are the symptoms of small and fearful minds
precautions will not conquer empires they will not build great cities they will not transmute dreams into gold or carry men across wide oceans and precautions will not emphatically not win fair ladies and here he turned to ellen and lasciviously dropped his gaze to her long bare legs
ellen twisted away and sweetman laughed at her obvious discomfiture then as coolly as though he owned wavebreaker he stepped down into the central cockpit where he first brushed at then sat on one of the white cushioned seats by the ship wheel
i had a look round the boat he said very coolly and i approve of her
so tell me the cost of a week charter
the man you want to see i said is called matthew mcillvanney and his office is the pink building with the outside staircase
he not here this afternoon but you can doubtless telephone him next week
sweetman took a pair of polarised sunglasses from his shirt pocket and put them on before inspecting me again
he did not seem to like what he saw
you really not being noticeably helpful he said after a pause so let us try again shall we
would you please tell me the high season price for one week
how many passengers
ellen asked before i could refuse to answer
sweetman paused again this time to light a long pale blue cigarette with a slim gold lighter
he shrugged
two four six passengers
does it really matter
one week in high season costs ten thousand us dollars for two people and every extra couple is another thousand bucks
ellen voice was cold as though she disliked satisfying his curiosity
and to those prices you have to add the boat running costs
which are
sweetman asked carelessly
a lot
ellen said flatly
you talking fuel food and liquor plus any toys you might want aboard like scuba equipment snorkels or sailboards
sweetman drew on his fancy cigarette then blew a plume of smoke into wavebreaker rigging before smiling lazily at ellen
and tell me sweet creature do you count as a toy
or are you a part of the initial ten thousand dollars
get off the boat i said
shut up
he turned on me like a snake
you nothing but a hired hand breakspear so shut the fuck up
he glanced at the paint pot and brush that i was still holding
go and paint something
be useful
he stared into my eyes challenging me to defy him and when i did not move he looked back to ellen
i asked you a question dear heart
please be so good as to answer
get off this boat i told him but my anger only amused sweetman who unfolded his long thin legs from the cushioned thwart
dick off he said to me
i was surprised that he so eagerly sought to confront me
i am not a small man nor am i a weakling yet the thin sweetman seemed unconcerned as i jumped down into the cockpit
then i saw why he was so confident
he put a hand into a pocket of his elegant duster coat and brought out a small pistol that he pointed at my face
a ladies gun he said but remarkably effective at close range
nick
ellen called warningly as though i might not have seen the gun
the gun threat had not stopped my advance
i was calling sweetman bluff confident he would not dare pull the trigger and equally confident that my marine training would let me turn him into mincemeat
i was also half drunk and thus filled with the dutch courage offered by mama sipcott worst white wine
sweetman stood
there was at last a look of alarm on his face and i could see him wondering whether he really would have to pull the small trigger
he held the gun pointed at my eyes
the picture very like the one rufus fletcher had taken in the summer of occupied the screen for about fifteen seconds
the whole item was allowed no more than four times that in the bbc sunday evening news broadcast at
the other seconds were taken up by a policeman talking to a reporter about having nothing to say except that there would be an inquest
but shiva and lili manjusri saw the picture and so did rufus fletcher
adam unwinding in puerto de la cruz did not of course see it
he did not even see an english newspaper
they were expensive to buy and came a day late
he did not want to be reminded of home and the only paper he even glanced at was the international herald tribune a copy of which anne found on the beach
his father at home in edgware said to his wife
good god wyvis hall as i live and breathe
beryl peered but the picture immediately vanished
yes i suppose it was
the policeman talked the reporter trying to jog him into revelations and failing
in the background autumnal trees could be seen and a church on the summit of a low hill
lewis sat shaking his head less as a gesture of denial than of a generalized despair at the state of the world
it was not that unpleasant memories were evoked for these were always with him his existence was inseparable from that old bitterness but that a sight of the house even the glimpse of a photograph revived the precise feelings he had had why it must be getting on for eleven years ago
ten and a half said his wife
i shall have to get in touch with the police
no two ways about it i shall have to get in touch with them
not this evening surely said beryl who wanted to watch mastermind
lewis said nothing
the room in which they were sitting underwent the curious shrinking process to which it was subject whenever he was reminded of wyvis hall or his uncle hilbert or even if the county of suffolk were mentioned
suddenly it grew small and poky
the brick of his neighbour house seemed to have moved itself four or five feet further towards the dividing fence so that it loomed offensively
lewis got up and pulled the curtains across with a pettish jerk of his hands
should you wait until adam gets back
beryl said
why
what would that be in aid of
beryl meant that adam had been among the previous owners of wyvis hall while her husband had not but she knew better than to point this out
there is no one living knows that lovely place better than
that true
i sha wait till adam returns lewis said in that manner that had once led his daughter to call him the frog footman
but i shall wait until tomorrow
men and women do not usually put their baser feelings and intentions into words not even in the deep recesses of their own minds
so lewis did not say even to himself when he was privately considering trying to get hold of his son in tenerife that he disliked adam and would have been pleased to spoil his holiday
instead he rationalized his thoughts and justified himself adam probably indeed almost certainly knew nothing about the find in the pine wood but adam had once owned the house and had thus taken on a responsibility
he could not shed that responsibility just because he had sold the place
lewis would have agreed with oscar wilde that our past is what we are
we can not rid ourselves of it
therefore it was adam duty to come home and face the music even though this might be no more than a short blast on a tin whistle
but he had no precise idea where adam was and he did not think adam travel agent a personal friend of the young would tell him
some excuse would be made for not telling him
lewis bark anyway was always worse than his bite
he had virtually no bite as he had once overheard adam say to bridget and heard it with helpless chagrin
a bloody good thing or our childhood would have been a misery instead of just a bore
lewis walked into his local police station in edgware on monday morning
they seemed surprised to see him but not astonished
the suffolk police had begun hunting up previous owners of wyvis hall and they had been alerted that a lived in their area
there were after all only two in the london phone directory
this might be a bonus
he was asked to wait and then shown into a room where a detective sergeant prepared to take a statement from him
with busy pomposity lewis dictated it to a typist and would have gone on and on had he not been diplomatically restrained
wyvis hall nunes suffolk and the twenty acres of land surrounding it were the property through his marriage of my uncle hilbert
they came into the possession of my son hilbert john adam under my uncle will bypassing myself though my son was no more than nineteen at the time of my uncle death
being an undergraduate at the time my son naturally never considered actually residing in the house
he was in agreement with my suggestion that the property be sold and before he returned to college in the autumn of he took my advice and placed house and lands in the hands of an estate agent
country properties were not selling well at the time
was the asking price and i was not surprised that the sale so to speak hung fire
however in the spring of an offer was made which my son accepted
this sale later fell through and it was not until the following august that wyvis hall was finally sold to a mr and mrs langan for the much improved figure of
as far as i know my son personal acquaintance with wyvis hall was confined to my uncle lifetime when my wife and son and daughter frequently stayed with him
after my uncle death in april he visited wyvis hall on perhaps two or at the most three separate occasions simply for the purpose of looking it over and reaching a decision about the disposal of furniture and effects
i suppose it is possible that squatters or other vagrants took possession of the house between the time of my uncle death and the sale of the property
certainly my son never let it or allowed anyone to occupy it on either a temporary or permanent basis
my son is at present on holiday in tenerife with his wife and daughter
i can not say precisely when i expect him to return though i should suppose in about a week from now
it was all very small and quiet and
the snippet in rufus monday morning newspaper measured just an inch in depth
it answered the question he had asked himself and told him that the bones of a very young child had been found as well as those of a young woman
this was not a shock
how could it be otherwise since this was wyvis hall and the pine wood and the animal cemetery
to photograph the house for the news last night the cameraman must have stood just where he had stood himself on the edge of the lawn with his back to the cedar tree
a popular
camera he had used but quite a good one
one thing about zosie pilfering she never stole rubbish
he had taken a picture of her after that and one of the animal cemetery
why is the grass always so short up here
adam had asked
rabbits i expect
why ca bloody rabbits come and eat my lawns
adam always referred to my lawns my house my furniture
it had got up rufus nose a bit though adam had a perfect right to do this
it was his all of it and it went to his head rather
seldom inherit country mansions after all
it must have been some time in august when i took those pictures rufus thought and a couple of weeks later it was all over
coincidentally as the community and their lives together broke up so did the weather
it was raining intermittently all the time they were in the cemetery the pines bowing and shivering in the wind
sometimes they had had to stop and take shelter under the closely
if the weather had held and still been hot and dry would they have dug deeper
probably not
in spite of the rain the earth was still as hard as iron
a sheet of rain had come down then a hard gusty shower while they were laying the squares of turf back in place and adam had said something about the rain making the grass grow quickly the rain being on their side
we should all go our separate ways as soon as we can rufus had said
we should pack up now and go
the spade and the fork they had hung up among the other tools in the stables
they had packed and adam had locked up the house
at some point rufus himself had taken the things out of the fridge and left the door open to defrost it
adam closed the front door and stood there for a moment as if he could not wrench himself away
so much of its beauty had been stripped from it by the whipping winds
and by the neglect of the long hot summer
a sudden gust of rain dashed against the red bricks that were already stained in patches by water
the house that when he first saw it had seemed to float on a raft of golden mist now lay in a wilderness amidst ragged grass and straggling bushes and trees dead from the heat
dirty grey clouds tumbled across the sky above the slate roof now the only thing that shone glazed with rain
but rufus admitted to himself that the beauties of nature and architecture had never meant much to him
it was the heat and sunshine and privacy he liked
and now he longed only to get away
they all got into goblander and he drove away up the drift adam next to him the others in the back
the drift had become a tunnel of overgrowth that dripped water on to the roof of the van
none of them allowed their eyes to turn towards the pine wood
at the top they came out into uncompromising bright grey light the bleak hedgeless lane the flat meadows where here and there stunted trees squatted like old men in cloaks
adam simile not his thought rufus with a grimace
no one asked where he was taking them
no one spoke
adam had hilbert old stuck between his legs and rufus guessed the gun was inside it
they must have gone a good two miles before they met another car
rufus overtook a bus going to colchester and dropped the two in the back so that they could catch it
he took adam on to sudbury for him to catch a train there and at that point they parted
adam got down from goblander and said
for ever and for ever farewell rufus
which was probably a quotation from something though rufus did not know what and thought fastidiously that it was in bad taste histrionic though just like adam
take care said rufus and not looking back any more than he had done when they returned from the cemetery drove off round the town he had got to know so well over the stour bridge into essex heading for halstead and dunmow and ongar and london
he never had seen any of them again
there had been no need to pretend to turn aside
briefly starting his fifth year in medical school something over thirteen months later he had wondered if shiva manjusri would be one of the incoming freshmen
but no his intuition had been accurate
at any rate shiva face was not among the several brown faces
as for the others avoiding them had presented no problems
would they get in touch with him now
no contingency plans had been made for this eventuality
so long as there was no hunt for a missing girl they had felt themselves reasonably safe
their minds had not reached out to the terror of what had in fact happened
none of them had been the kind of people who could have imagined devotion to a pet animal or according to it funerary rites
it was shiva who had proposed the site
they had congratulated him on his ingenuity
ten years
an ovarian cyst nothing to get upset about rufus told ms beauchamp
she was an editor with a distinguished publishing house married to an investigative journalist
as yet they had no children but she wanted four she told rufus
no reason why you should
he had another glance at her notes
in fact a peculiarity about this condition is that it seldom if ever occurs in a woman who had a baby
my god she said putting her coat on
there was making my husband life a misery sure i got the dreaded
they all thought they got the dreaded c poor things
you could blame them
rufus took her off her by the reception desk having set in train the arrangements by which she would be admitted to a fashionable west end clinic with rufus her surgery and her hospitalization ultimately paid for by some provident association to which she and her husband subscribed
rufus shook hands
he walked back to his consulting room dying for a cigarette
this was unlike him
he could usually get through quite easily until after lunch
he thought i know what my idea of heaven would be if by heaven we mean a place of bliss in which to pass eternity a sanctuary where one might without impairment of breathing destruction of the lungs or damage to the heart light each fresh cigarette from the glowing butt of its predecessor and drink but chilled vodka laced with two drops of angostura and a gill of newly opened perrier endlessly with increasing euphoria until a peak of joy and ease was reached but without any nausea or pain or dehydration or oblivion
sitting alone he lit his cigarette the first of the day and there came that faint swimming in the head a tautening of the gut
he closed his eyes
if it comes to light that i was in that house with adam and the others he thought with cold clarity if someone tells the papers or the police and thence the papers that i was there during the summer of living there it will be all up with me
i will lose my practice and my reputation and everything that i have and can look forward to if not my liberty
and without the rest i sha care about my liberty
it would be bad enough if i were a g p or an expert in some other branch of medicine an orthopaedic surgeon for instance or an ear nose and throat man but i am a gynaecologist and it is the bones of a young woman and a baby that have been found there
what worried woman would come to me
what mrs strawson or ms beauchamp
what gp would send her to me
if i were innocent thought rufus i know very well what i would do
i would pick up the phone and phone my solicitor and ask to come and see him and get his advice
he might advise me to make a statement to the police which i should of course do under his guidance
but i shall not do this because i am not innocent
i shall sit here and wait and sweat it out and look the facts in the face trying to anticipate the worst that can happen
the wonderful thing about the human mind adam thought is the way it copes when the worst happens
beyond that worst happening you think there can be nothing the unimaginable has taken place and on the other side is death destruction the end
but the worst happens and you reel from it you stagger the shock is enormous and then you begin to recover
you rally you stand up and face it
you get used to it
an hour maybe and you are making contingency plans
for what had happened was not the worst you realized that
the worst was yet to come was perhaps always yet to come never would actually come because if it did you would know it that would be reality and there would be nothing then but to kill yourself
quickly
now that he was able to he assembled what had happened and laid the facts before himself
they had dug up those bones at wyvis hall and had decided it was murder they were investigating
bones skeletons bodies do not bury themselves
those were the facts as far as he knew them up to this moment
he would know more much more in the days to come
what was certain was that he could no longer use the escape key
it was defunct
the passages it cancelled had in any case as in certain programmes not been lost but stored on some limbo disc from whence they must now be retrieved
adam sat in his parents house drinking tea
there must be a total retrieval now the one good thing about which was that it might banish his dreams
he was aware of a slight feeling of sickness and of cold an absence of hunger though he had been feeling quite hungry when he got off the plane
anne sat next to him on his mother settee and abigail lay on a plaid rug on the floor kicking with her legs and punching with her arms
his mother kept poking toys which she did not want at her
a passage from a novel by john came back to adam
he had memorized it years ago in the ecalpemos epoch the safest way to live is first inherit money second be born without taste for liquor third have a legitimate job that keeps you busy fourth marry a wife who will cooperate in your sexual peculiarities fifth join some big church sixth do live too long
apart from the last one which he had got to yet and the penultimate one which seemed to apply in america more than here here he had joined the golf club he had complied with all the rest
or his nature and luck had complied for him
nemesis had still come down like the wolf on the fold
he had not wanted to come back here
but there had been no spirit in him the shock of what his father told him had been too great
something that will interest you adam something to make you sit up
they dug up a lot of human bones at my old uncle house
by the time he had rallied and got himself together and was thinking of things to say to the police it was too late and they were heading north
anne was furious
when lewis said to come back with him and eat there adam had got a kick on the ankle from anne and another kick when he had replied
he had turned on her and said with cold savagery for fuck sake stop kicking me will you
he expected his father to rise and say something about that being no way to speak to one wife or not in front of the child he was capable of that
but he had said nothing only looked subdued and adam realized why
his own terrible fear and anger had communicated itself to his father and shown him what the better part of valour was keeping silent
having put the cat among the pigeons made mischief in his special way he was lying low now and waiting
the old bastard
adam only wished uncle hilbert had left him wyvis hall and then there would have been no ecalpemos no zosie and no deaths
and adam could see he would have been much worse off
he and anne would be living in a house like this one rather than that palace
children after all he thought looking at abigail were happy wherever they were so long as they were loved
his parents had not asked him what sort of holiday he had had or how the flight had been
the conversation was exclusively on the subject of the discovery at wyvis hall
adam did not know whether to be glad or sorry he had not obtained an english newspaper while away
if he had done the shock would have been less but on the other hand his holiday would have been spoilt
he would have liked very much to be alone
of course he knew there was no possibility of this now or when he returned home for when you were married you never could be alone
presumably that was the point
what was he going to tell anne
how much was he going to tell her
he did know
none of it if he could help it
they sat at the table in the dining area to eat an absurdly early high tea
lewis asked him if he could remember the day when he heard he had inherited wyvis hall and had walked in here and astounded them with his news
he had a beard then anne
lewis subdued air had changed to one of high good humour
you would have recognized him he looked like john the baptist
adam could remember very well but he was going to say so
what a funny thing said lewis
we had ham salad that day too
what a coincidence
oh yes i been meaning to ask you who was it looked after wyvis hall while you were in greece
adam could eat nothing
the other time he remembered it was his father who had been able to eat
he did know what lewis meant about someone looking after the house but no doubt he adam had at the time concocted some tale to keep his father quiet to keep him away even
someone from the village you said lewis persisted
how can i remember that far back
the police will want to know
it may be of vital importance
are you going to eat your meat dear said beryl
abigail who had been put upstairs in one of the bedrooms to sleep set up a wailing sound
adam was on his feet at once
i think we should go
they had to wait until his father was ready
adam would have preferred to phone for a hire car but lewis would hear of it
anne sat in the front in the passenger seat while adam was in the back with abigail
if his father could have found out what flight they were coming on the police certainly could
it was possible they might be waiting for him
they would wish to interview every former owner or occupant of wyvis hall
he looked again at the newspaper account of the adjourned inquest that his father had saved for him
it would be owners and occupants of wyvis hall between nine and twelve years before that they would wish to interview and those were hilbert who was dead himself and ivan langan to whom he had sold the house
as for other occupants how would they know who else had lived there
it was ironical that ten days before he had seen shiva at heathrow
the encounter he now saw as an omen a shadow cast by a coming event
what would that event be
adam did not want at this point to speculate it made feel sick
he turned the newspaper over so that he could not see that headline and those paragraphs
in high spirits his father was talking about the immense advances made in forensic science in recent years
as soon as they got home anne started getting abigail to bed
their cases humped upstairs and put into the bedroom adam looked rufus fletcher up in the phone book
he was in there twice at a wimpole street number and again at an address in mill hill rufus fletcher mb mrcp
all these years then or for some of them rufus had been living three or four miles from him
he could look shiva up because he could remember his surname
women marry and change their names he thought there was no point in pursuing that one
of course he could look up robin tatian but where really would that get him
he was the blue directory when anne came back with abigail in her arms so adam took her and carried her back to bed himself and tucked her in and kissed her
she was almost asleep
he wondered if rufus had children and if so did he worry about them coming to terrible harm the way adam worried
was his whole life affected by what had happened at ecalpemos
adam might have escaped the file memories for years suppressed them and jerked violently away from them but he had never been able to pretend he was unscathed by those events
sometimes he felt that he was the person he was because of them and acted the way he did because of their effects
he sat by abigail cot not wanting to remember but knowing that now he must
there was nothing in his house to remind him of ecalpemos
everything that was left everything he and rufus had sold had gone to ivan langan with the house
for a song too because he had not been able to bear the thought of going back meeting a valuer walking about the house picking things off shelves and out of cupboards
only once had he returned after they all left and that had been bad enough like a dream no like stepping into the set and scenario of some frightening film a hitchcock movie perhaps
he asked the taxi he had taken to put him down at the top of the drift and he had walked to the house
it was almost a year since he had been there and in that time nothing had been done nothing had been touched
from the pine wood he simply averted his eyes till later
the drift was thickly overgrown a dank tunnel out of whose bushy sides the tendrils of brambles and briar roses caught at his clothes
one of these whipped back at him and as he caught at it a thorn drove into the fleshy pad of his finger
that thorn had been there festering for months
a dull cool summer it had been as different as could be from the year before
no golden light bathed the red brick of the house
it no longer looked mellow
beautiful yes but severe somehow and to adam heightened awareness reproachful
he found himself encouraging fostering the scenario illusion
only thus only by pretending unreality pretending this was a part he acted could he go on cross the wild shaggy grass go past the cedar tree arrive at the porch set in its four doric columns and insert his key in the lock
conclusion
task analysis has not and can not be reduced to a set of standardised procedures which the aspiring analyst could acquire in a formal training course
the techniques just described are no more than guidelines in what remains the creative art of studying and describing what an experienced worker is doing or will be required to do
the danger in being too rigid is that justice will not be done to the flexibility and complexity of human performance
the danger of being too flexible is that the ergonomists will have an inadequate basis from which to design interfaces training courses and other operator aids
if a comprehensive task description can be completed then it is legitimate to enquire why the task can not be allocated to a technical device rather than a human being
yet without a reasonably comprehensive task description the total system performance may be unreliable or unpredictable
there is a necessary compromise which can only be arrived at in the context of a particular system
as mentioned earlier there are always the twin problems of how to get the information and how to present it
it is sometimes easier to proceed on the basis of if i were doing the job this is how i would do it but this can be delusory even for analysts who have past experience as operators
for analysts who are designers creating a new task there may be no alternative but any task description arrived at by this method should be checked against the behaviour of real operators as they gain experience
a particular difficulty about task synthesis is that there is no easy way of confirming completeness
a task description which is part of a design process should be fully documented in terms of the origins of information the assumptions made and the methods used
the standard method of producing task descriptions is to write all the separate at various levels on cards and then assemble the cards in a network
there is a temptation to make these final diagrams very large but often it is more useful to separate into small units with
the optimum size seems to be this is easily copied and circulated but is large enough to contain considerable detail
the procedure can be computerised there are programmes available for the easy production manipulation and storage of block diagrams with useful facilities
there is an inherent difficulty in that often the main dividend from a task analysis is from the act of obtaining it
those not involved find it difficult to gain very much from a presentation of a task description
like reference books they have to be used rather than read
task analysis can be very expensive in skilled manpower but in looking at it is important to include in value the increase in mutual understanding which occurs when a team conducts the analysis
if such a team is used the required can be optimised by using the delphi method rather than a long series of group meetings
political economic and social issues which arise in conducting task analyses are discussed in the context of job analysis
application
planning
the human resource concept of as the central asset of any organisation has made some progress over the past twenty years
there was particular interest around when companies were prosperous stable and innovative ipm patten
the objective is to revise and almost reverse the traditional accountancy concept of as a resource consuming factor requiring regular payments overheads in the form of heated lighted equipped workspaces and so on
from the narrow accountancy viewpoint people are a cost and it is desirable to keep this cost as low as possible
in these terms it is very difficult to justify for example sending a member of staff on a training course
the training requires expenditure and so also does the replacement for the person away
where is the return
the return is actually in the improved human resource but this is not readily measurable in terms which accountants use
there have been two attempts to reduce human resources to this form of measurement giles and robinson
one is to acquire a human asset multiplier for each level of staff
the multiplier for manual staff might be unity but it increases with staff level and becomes three or more for management
the other is to add together all the personnel costs for each kind of worker from the original job advertisement through to the retirement or redundancy payments
the first does attempt to obtain a value the second remains essentially a cost and not a value
it would be unduly optimistic to assume that management skills have risen to a level such that costs undertaken can be assumed to be equivalent to value
a less direct measure which is applicable only to the most senior management is to observe the fall or rise of the share price when a particular executive leaves or joins a company
this can be very high for a large company a change in market value of millions of pounds is not unusual
the most serious consequence of the accountancy view of is that high level policy does not give this factor sufficient weight
for example the main board of a company will have complete details of cost and values of physical resources such as buildings and equipment but relatively scanty data about the which is their most important asset
indeed it will be described almost entirely as a liability because the costs will be known
similarly broad factors such as the state of morale will again only be described by negative features such as absenteeism stoppages strikes low quality output and so on
it is obvious that company output and projects must reflect the and its performance level but if this is acknowledged at all it is only in brief verbal terms within for example the chairman annual report
the obsession of current management with measurement and the reduction of every variable to numbers for ease of computer manipulation has worsened the situation
unfortunately there is no easy remedy
human resources are too complex a variable to be easily susceptible to measurement beyond the level of counting heads and trades
key variables such as the quality of staff at any level and the current morale are only expressible in general verbal descriptive terms
it is generally accepted that hygiene type variables such as pay and working conditions can if they are inappropriately specified depress morale and motivation but they will not in themselves result in very high levels of these parameters
morale and motivation are influenced more by conditions of work in the sense of work variety opportunities and attitudes of management
these factors are worthy of emphasis because in practice they are still dealt with very badly in many organisations and yet it takes little trouble or expertise to make an enormous difference
for example very few senior managements take the trouble to keep workers fully informed about policies and likely changes
the result is excessive reliance on rumour and continuous speculation which is not only but is also highly deleterious in morale terms
the two human factors which can be unambiguously measured are age and sex
the age distribution of a work force is always an interesting and important source of information
for most purposes a rectangular distribution is the most desirable because it provides the appropriate mix of youthful enthusiasm and ageing experience
it also makes for regular changes as staff retire and are replaced
many distributions show a peak in a particular age group mainly associated with taking on a large number of young people when the organisation was started or reorganised this is not desirable because it leads to excessive competition for promotion at particular stages
these comments are obviously most relevant for work forces where there is little tendency to move out this is characteristic of a surprisingly large number of organisations in european countries and in japan but much less so in the
stable work forces have their advantages in terms of familiarity with the enterprise and its peculiar needs but they do result in problems if the market for the products is erratic or otherwise unpredictable
this is particularly so in high technology design and construction of ships aircraft power stations and chemical plant where the product unit is large and expensive and the variety of required expertise is extensive
some peaks of demand can be dealt with by using consultants but they tend to be expensive and do not always fit well with but important factors such as the favoured style of the organisation
in well ordered systems it may be possible to calculate the length of experience required to achieve the required level of expertise in particular topics and compare this with the lead time for particular product requirements
given time available to train new staff it is not necessary to keep more than a nucleus in that particular expertise
on the other hand if there is usually insufficient notice of need it may be necessary to keep staff who have periods with little to do between projects
it is also desirable to have the possibility of shifting staff between design and operational duties
this not only provides flexibility in the use of it also improves communication
these real difficulties of utilisation are such as to force many organisations to become larger and larger if they are to remain economic
size provides a cushion to the vicissitudes of markets but it creates other problems
for example difficulties of communications and in particular how to inculcate the feeling within each individual that he and his performance are important to the organisation
this is considered in more detail in chapter
human resources should be fundamental to subjects such as ergonomics which are essentially but the concept remains procedurally undeveloped at any level from a continent through countries regions and companies down to particular working systems
this is one reason why policy makers never seem to take account fully of the people affected by their decisions
the design of procedures
the increased importance of standardised informational support for both machines and operators has led to the concept of procedures as a separate design issue within a system fig
much of this information can be incorporated in computer programs but there is also a need for extensive printed paper for the use of the operator
this takes three main forms checklists routines and
the terminology in this field is not standardised
software might be restricted as in this book to computer programs but it is sometimes used as the generic term to include all sources of information
procedures is sometimes used for what are here called routines and sometimes to indicate all the operator information support except software
the situation is further confused when some but not all the operator information support is itself
sometimes the term is used
however whatever the terminology used there is a requirement for design effort
the quality of procedures would be much improved if designers followed some simple table
many documents are written on the implicit assumption that the reader is much like the writer in terms of expertise and style of thinking
similarly it is assumed that the conditions under which the reading will take place are the same as those of writing which are usually a clean office
they may have to be read in the open air in rain and darkness or within a plant under oily cramped poorly lit conditions
the user probably has limited expertise and he may be working under various stress conditions
the material on which the information is printed the typeface used the sequence the structure and the format generally should reflect the conditions of use easterby and zwaga
all these things can be achieved if it is acknowledged that all procedures should a validated by users under the normal conditions of use
checklists
checklists are used in the mode for routine maintenance and for
they normally take the form of a series of questions or statements which the operator uses to guide and structure his inspection of the hardware and other system components
the sequence is dictated by the optimal order in which actions should be taken for example in starting up an aircraft
there are many situations when the order is of no great consequence for example a safety audit of a new machine and in this latter case some logical structure is needed
as mentioned above the logic of the design may not be the optimal basis if the way the operator thinks and acts is different
baker suggests that four kinds of shortcoming emerge when checklists are validated in the real situation
the operator may deviate from the listed procedure because it may require excessive moving about or because he is interrupted by the requirements of other tasks
systematic use of a checklist often reveals faults in work design such as inadequate access visibility and labelling
the checklist itself may be inconsistent incomplete imprecise or ambiguous
finally the checklist may have reprographic limitations such as inadequate vertical or horizontal structure poor typefaces and insufficient linking of requirements descriptions remarks and points
the international ergonomics association developed a general ergonomics checklist which is reproduced in edholm
there is a deceptive simplicity about such lists which requires extensive effort to ensure a comprehensive but coherent content
the context is of course the context of ergonomics as conceived by the designers of the list
routines
a routine is the most common form of instructional material
the reader is required to follow a series of steps which might for example introduce a change in the performance of a complex system
normally routines are single chains of instructions although it is possible to have some conditional branching
each step should be simple and complete in itself preferably with some indication that successful completion has been achieved for example the appearance or the change of colour of a signal light or the noise of a motor starting or a change of pressure which indicates that there has been a change in the flow of some material
as mentioned earlier a routine can often be regarded as a written task description
by definition and design intention routines are inflexible
the user is intended to behave exactly according to their instruction
no great skill or intellectual effort is required which is one way of saying that the human operator is being but the purpose of a routine is usually to avoid common human error such as omitting a step or reversing steps
in general the value of formal routines is precisely that the operator left to himself will not normally function in such a systematic sequential manner
knowledge texts
knowledge is contained in documents which may vary from single sheet presentations to large manuals
as instructional material it is indirect in that the reader is not necessarily told what to do as in a routine
rather he is informed about the situation and the purpose of informing him is to provide a knowledge base from which he can work out his own actions
nevertheless the relevant action remains important and the knowledge provided should be carefully and stringently selected
it is too easy to follow the academic tradition and provide knowledge for its own sake
the need to know criterion is crucial because unless it is applied the operator can be overburdened with unnecessary material
correspondingly the material should be structured in terms of how it is most likely to be used
in this context the operator requires a guide for action and not a scientific
it is invariably better to provide material diagrammatically systematically or at least in short paragraphs rather than in flowing prose
consider for example how readily information about the relative position of streets is available from a map of a town centre rather than a verbal description of all the streets
such a map will enable the reader to work out for himself how to get from one location to another within the town
note the enormous flexibility compared with a routine which would tell him only how to get from one particular point to another
a second important difference is that if he misses his place in a routine he will be totally lost whereas if he happens to go in the wrong direction while using a map he is still able to make whatever correction is necessary
however the map does require more intellectual effort than does the routine not only in making decisions about how to proceed but also in filtering out the required information from the massive irrelevance for a particular task which is equally available
thus one would expect the use of the maps to be slower than the use of routines with the human performance being more versatile but less predictable
with representations such as maps it remains important to avoid too much homogeneity and provide substructure in the form of main roads and key buildings or other features such as rivers
see for example fig
manuals which may contain maps schematic diagrams and other materials warrant separate consideration
the design of manuals
a manual is usually in the form of a book or booklet which is sent with the hardware from the maker to the customer
it is part of the communication package from the designer to the user
thus it is a particular form of job aid which provides the operator with information on a system and its performance
the standard of manual design has traditionally been very low for several reasons
for this purpose the designer is too familiar with the product and he rarely takes the trouble to find out what the user really needs to know
often the manual has to be provided hurriedly at the end of a project when the budget is running out and it is regarded as a tiresome chore still required after the essential design work has been completed
the problem is particularly acute for computers
manuals for cars machine tools and so on are poor but at least it is possible to observe the mechanisms and their functions
most computer operators do not know or wish to know about the mechanisms and in any case these are not accessible to vision and manipulation
the computer operator is entirely dependent on the manual at least in the early stages of gaining familiarity with the system and its functions
he is usually very badly served although the principles of manual design are well known
for most systems the manual is best divided into parts as indicated in table
the first part should be a general introduction which orientates the readers towards the system its purpose its functional structure and mode of operation and its performance limits
this should be followed by a separate section on how to set the system up in the first place and how to check that it is working properly
if it is fairly small it may be necessary to describe how to unpack it fix it into position connect it to power supplies and start it up
if it is large the emphasis will be on the start up procedure
the section describing the operation of the system should cover not only how the system operates but also how the user can operate it
extensive use of line drawings schematic diagrams algorithmic lists is desirable and where prose is used this also should be structured into short sentences with meaningful separation into paragraphs
the maintenance section should indicate what if anything the operator is expected to do and the symptoms which indicate that more specialist maintenance skills are required
tables subdivided into can be extremely helpful
parts lists including description reference numbers and sometimes drawings are necessary if the user is expected to deal with his own replacements
a standard fault is to assume that the reader is familiar with the jargon which the designer habitually uses
a glossary of terms and acronyms used can be very helpful not only to the reader but also to the writer who is forced to consider carefully how he is using various technical terms
finally all manuals should end with an index which supplements the table of contents at the beginning
attempting to integrate under fives
policy in islington
margaret boushel clare debenham lisa dresner and anna gorbach
during the margaret boushel claire debenham lisa dresner and anna gorbach worked in the london borough of islington within social services for children
this chapter is an account of the way they perceived attempts to develop integrated provision for under fives and the barriers in attitudes and systems which were encountered
the first section provides an overview of provision and services in
the next section describes attempts to create a clear policy
the third section looks at the faltering progress towards integrated services
the fourth section examines the formidable barriers that were posed by reorganisation of social services local authority cuts and the demise of the inner london education authority
the chapter concludes with a mixture of resignation and determination
background services in islington
islington is a inner city london borough with a child population of
in per cent of under fives in islington had the use of an facility per cent on a and per cent on a basis
between and provision gradually increased so that by there were children day centres about playgroups and assisted places funded partially or totally by the social services department and and places in nursery schools funded by the inner london education authority
the beacon nursery a local mencap project offered care five days per week to children over one year of age categorised as having severe learning difficulties
unlike council day centres playgroups or community nurseries the beacon nursery was free
children were collected from home by special bus and places were available on demand
the beacon had been in existence for many years and in the past had catered for up to thirty children with a wide range of disabilities and needs
by it had half that number on roll
since numbers at the beacon continued to fall as it was increasingly seen as a resource for children with severe and multiple disabilities
in addition the elfreda rathbone organisation a voluntary organisation helping people with learning disabilities ran a free day nursery in the borough for a small number of children with learning difficulties
some integrated services emerged in the early one playscheme was developed through a parent initiative and an integrated adventure playground was established by a voluntary organisation
workers from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported a local special school in integrating under fives into a playgroup
in addition to its mainstream schools the borough included five special schools providing primary and secondary education to children with special needs from islington and neighbouring boroughs one for children with moderate learning difficulties one for children with severe learning difficulties one for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties one for autistic children and one for children with physical disabilities
in three of these offered nursery places to children from the age of
the children using all of these services came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds though rarely was this actively and positively reflected in the type of care provided or the ethnic background of their carers
residential units
by residential services were designed with care in the community in mind but most were based in specialist settings
for example field end house had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with learning difficulties and was designed to offer respite round the clock care
parents had fought for this as a local resource to prevent the need for children to be placed in placements far from home
by field end had been joined by another specialist children respite care unit at leigh road
the social services department also provided thirteen and residential units for children in care by their number had been reduced to eleven none with wheelchair access and only one with any experience of caring for children with learning difficulties
the community health team
the community health team had major responsibility for assessing children and recommending provision
it included physiotherapists occupational and speech therapists doctors psychologists and a specialist health visitor
they were joined in the network by specialist teachers funded by the ilea and based in the special schools who visited children at home before they were due to start school
this group of people met on a regular basis to coordinate services and discuss professional issues
discussion of services to individual children also took place
this included deciding between day care or school and parents attitudes to different options
often a member of the group was delegated to advise parents on a course of action
the community health team aim was to ensure a place of treatment for children from the earliest possible age to enable them to develop to their fullest potential
they were however an group operating without directly involving parents and were generally committed to specialist care in the community
they gave support to the beacon and elfreda rathbone nurseries and most members saw these settings as the best places to treat children
because of their early contact with parents they often had considerable influence in steering parents towards specialist provision
the special services team
in the early social workers were funded jointly by the ilea and islington social services department to work with children attending two special schools and two specialist units for partially hearing children
these social workers were based in the borough special services team
they all worked with some under fives attending the schools they covered
they were aware of a number of children who did not have adequate access to resources or support when parents and professionals were becoming aware of the possible extent and implications of the disability
when a vacancy arose within this group of social workers in it was decided to appoint someone specialising in work with under fives with special needs
this might have had the effect of drawing families into the specialist system at an earlier stage
instead for a number of reasons it proved to be a key step in the development of the debate about integration in islington
first the post was not attached to any specialist institution
there was an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely with the beacon nursery
second the worker had an alternative peer group of workers who were key figures in controlling access to all other facilities
third the worker was committed to the idea that treatment of a medical or disabling condition should not take precedence over the child social emotional and cultural needs
there was now a new worker in the network who also made an early relationship with families but who could present a broader choice of day care to parents
attempting an integration policy
the labour council elected in had as a stated policy aim that every child whose parents so wished was entitled to a place of some sort
this led to the initiation of an review
the review team set up under the auspices of the social services committee included councillors senior departmental management and representatives of the children day centre organisers and social workers in its membership
it proposed a network of centres throughout the borough an idea which the workers had been anxious to promote for some time
day care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the children day centres which would also provide information support and resources to parents
the review had made no mention of children with special needs
the specialist social worker and another worker with a personal interest in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources for these children
they interviewed parents specialist professionals and mainstream workers and they designed a questionnaire which was completed by workers in a large proportion of mainstream council services and voluntary organisations as well as by some
broadly the survey confirmed that parents of children with special needs had not been given a real choice of placement and that they had to fight hard for mainstream provision if this was their choice
parents wanted to be part of the and did not feel that they were
many commented on lack of information about the range of facilities on offer
one woman described how she felt that she was never given a choice of provision for her son and objected to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good
she fought hard to get him a playgroup place in the group his older brother attended
because the group had known her and her children for some time they agreed to have a go and the placement went ahead
she commented
i had to fight every step of the way for this
no one told me about it and no one wanted him to have it
i knew it was right for him this is where he learnt to join in and be like other children
it does matter that he not like them
i know what is right for my child but i not supposed to say
parents also wanted an increased availability of specialist therapy time but wanted it to be used in a more flexible way
some parents were very worried that more integrated settings would lead to lack of attention for children with special needs
definitions of special needs varied widely in the questionnaire responses some defining it as children with disabilities some including children with behavioural and emotional problems and some including children whose first language was not english
this made the survey difficult to interpret
the findings were documented in a report a place for all our children ccuf and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special needs with suggestions for how these might be overcome
these ideas were informed by a paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local mencap group who had previously tried to generate the debate within the community health service through the mencap committee
the conference a place for all our children
as a result of this work the coordinating committee for under fives ccuf an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector groups and individuals providing a service to under fives decided to organise a conference to look at the issues of integration of special needs children within mainstream provision
prior to the conference various groups met to produce short contributions to the debate
these included parents workers specialist workers children day centre organisers and playgroups organisers
each of these groups came up with a list of proposals which were sent to everyone attending
about people attended the conference held in april
workshops facilitated by the speakers and the conference organising group examined integration policies overcoming practical problems for children in integrated provision and available sources of information
the conference made the following recommendations

for a formal universal information system covering local and specialist resources

for children needs to be considered with parents and their wishes acknowledged and recognised

for employment of extra staff where needed and employment of peripatetic special needs workers

for availability of money for equipment toys and adaptations

for enhanced payments to caring for children with special needs

for priority status for children with special needs in order to facilitate access to ordinary provision

for training facilities for staff in ordinary provision specialist provision and

for greater communication and sharing of resources between ordinary and specialist provision

for therapeutic and professional staff to reflect the cultural backgrounds of the children and that for all children including those with special needs their environment and activities to express a consciousness of the multicultural society in islington
it was made clear that all of the above areas needed funding from health education and social services before they could be implemented
finally it was felt that unless the attitudes of advisers and became more positive towards integration none of the recommendations could be effective
d warfare and crusades
the poet marbod of rennes celebrated in latin the vengeance which would befall a wicked castellan and his troops
the poem highlights two important developments the use of force in punishing aristocratic crime the fruit of princely and the increasing significance of in warfare
intellectuals claimed a formative influence in the second too john of marmoutier declared that monks from his own monastery had read vegetius de re militari to geoffrey le bel when he was investing the castle of a rebellious castellan and ascribed his success to their advice on firebombs
but common sense may have been more important than learning in perceiving the vulnerability of most castles to and catapults for even in they were as a rule primitive structures
demanded on the one hand skilled operators and on the other a plentiful supply of unskilled labourers to move the necessary materials
this effectively restricted their use to the wealthy and to those whose claim to assistance under the ban was incontrovertible
equally the improvements in fortification needed to withstand their effects thick stone walls inner as well as outer defences required incomes greater than those of simple lords
the net effect was that given dedication princes louis vi geoffrey le bel could subdue rebellious castellans within their own demesnes and could build castles of their own which were impregnable to all but lengthy and sustained attack
henry ii castle at chinon where the treasury of anjou was situated was the model for its generation with its halls upper chambers tower and curtain walling set on a high point above a strategic crossing of the loire
it could be copied only either by those of nearly equal wealth or by those who could concentrate their resources chiefly on defence princes great bishops or in the south especially towns
all others became vulnerable
john of salisbury comment that not only the towns but also the fortresses of gaul feared henry i of england was revealing of the new situation
similarly campaigning in the field imposed an increasing financial burden
the treaty between robert ii of flanders and henry i of england renewed by their successors stipulated that each knight supplied to the english king should bring three horses with him this at a time when a horse represented a major investment
then knightly armour grew more elaborate and costly throughout the century
and though some knights might be supplied free by feudal service household ones had to be maintained by their lords mercenary ones needed pay and those with constituted a regular charge on the treasury
besides away from their home base knights were useless on their own
in open battle and in the plundering expeditions that constituted the normal form of aggressive warfare they needed the backing of archers both mounted and on foot and of numerous infantrymen
the usual source of supply was town militias suger mentions those of rheims laon soissons etampes and paris in the royal army of
but they might have to be supplemented by mercenaries from flanders and the low countries where the rapidly expanding population forced large numbers of young men into military careers
in the eyes of the faithful these brabanters with their freebooting and lack of discipline after the end of campaigns were as dangerous as heretics in frederick barbarossa and louis vii agreed to expel them from their lands
their value in battle as shields behind which the knights could shelter before they launched their charge ensured their continued employment by those who could afford them notably henry ii of england
but the hatred they aroused meant that they were liable to be brutally slaughtered if captured afterwards
inevitably therefore war on the grand scale as fought by princes bore little resemblance in practice to the feuds of lesser men
the divergence was sharpened by the application of a theoretical distinction the fruit of augustinian theology amplified as the century went on by canon and roman law reference princes pronounced their campaigns just wars fought against aggressors with the aim of peace or public wars declared by a competent authority in the public interest while they condemned the wars of lesser men as infractions of the peace
geoffrey martel had perceived the propaganda potential of public war as early as the mid eleventh century later it enabled henry the liberal of champagne to claim the military service of all lords within his county a reapplication of the carolingian ban
so it could be a powerful weapon
yet the logic of the definition suggested that it would benefit especially kings whose competence to declare war could not be impugned thus thibaud of blois failed to persuade the monks of marmoutier that they owed him service when he fought against louis vi they claimed discretion in the matter and in the mighty philip of alsace hesitated to commit to battle the army he had summoned against philip augustus through fear that its ranks might melt away
the contrast with the united front louis vi and his troops presented to the emperor henry v in was marked
a royal banner now bestowed respectability on a cause kings wars were assumed to be for the sake of peace even when cripplingly expensive and increasingly savage
this goes some way to explaining why the complicated campaigns within toulouse in the second half of the century were largely fought out under the banners of the angevin aragonese and french kings and why the revolts of henry ii sons had widespread ramifications
the twelfth century was characterized therefore by fewer but more protracted wars which smouldered for long periods between short sharp bouts of conflict like the war that covered must of the reigns of henry i of england and louis vi of france the one inaugurated by the great rebellion of which outlived both louis vii and henry ii or that against catalan claims in the south
into these large numbers of local conflicts were subsumed
the pattern caused problems in that the circumstances which might trigger off renewed fighting were unpredictable yet the moment an opportunity offered princes had to be prepared for invading their enemies there was no time for lengthy preparation
the usual tactic was to march troops across the enemy territory plundering and looting to take fortified places if the task was easy to obtain allies among the lords of the locality and to retreat without fighting a battle if at all possible in effect an application to a wider canvas of the some technique of warfare which had earlier made castellans formidable in the immediate environs of their castles
it necessitated the rapid mobilization of auxiliaries to join a core of troops kept constantly at the ready the princes military households which became the linch pin of the system
john of marmoutier life of geoffrey le bel offers a glimpse of how strong bonds were created between the prince and his followers within the household and how a high level of training was maintained at all times
geoffrey was brought up from infancy with the sons of neighbouring angevin lords on whose companionship he relied
when it came time for him to be knighted by henry i in rouen he set off for normandy with a crowd of these young men about him
in rouen the occasion was celebrated with pomp elaborate dress and a great feast and then the youths all demonstrated their military skill at a grand tournament at which geoffrey naturally won the highest honours
it was within this kind of environment that chivalry flourished that young men learned to identify their vassalage towards their lord as a symbol of their honour that they debated the relative merits of roland and oliver way of displaying loyalty and that they learned the finer points of jousting
tournaments were disapproved of by ecclesiastics for they could be both bloody and dangerous
yet they supplied real needs
that of an instruction in the martial arts compatible with the maintenance of a prince peace that of an outlet for competitive instincts within the claustrophobic confines of a court and that of display to maintain princely social status
so they flourished everywhere
they offered opportunities for men of skill to acquire great position in the world arnoul of ardres caught the eye of countess ida of boulogne through his exploits and they also conferred lustre on the great geoffrey le bel and philip of alsace were throughout france for their distinguished performances in these show battles
all this formed a background to the first century of crusading and it goes some way to explaining the more secular aspects of the magnetism which drew french knights to take up the cross in their thousands
urban ii launching the first crusade at clermont in presented it as a natural evolution of the peace movement warriors were to forget their petty feuds and squabbles in a campaign to promote the interests of holy church
the war declared by one whose moral authority was unimpeachable was to free the eastern churches to end muslim guardianship of the holy places to restore jerusalem to its proper state
as princes saw it it was a just war in the fullest sense of the term those who were slaughtered in its battles were regarded as among the martyrs of the church
when raymond of toulouse robert ii of flanders robert curthose stephen of blois and hugh of vermandois responded to the call past and present members of their military households fell almost automatically into rank behind them to test themselves against terrible dangers but also to enjoy the companionship in arms the adventure the deeds of daring which were the stuff of the chansons de geste
that they shared along with all other participants in the crusade a fervent devotion a conviction that their sins would be forgiven is certain
yet for them crusading necessitated no large leap of the imagination no millenarian vision it was simply a challenging and a deserving extension of their everyday activities
in french eyes the hero of the first crusade was robert ii of flanders
while raymond of toulouse remained in outremer stephen and hugh disgraced themselves in escaping from the siege of antioch and robert curthose no matter how gallant at least in his lifetime failed to impress robert ii prestige soared to the skies
he became robert of jerusalem to his contemporaries his deeds were recorded in the song of antioch his pious bravery totally expunged the memory of robert the frisian usurpation and after his death his son baldwin vii harped on his father achievement to justify his substantial use of coercion against the enemies of the church
outside flanders robert sister marriage to roger of sicily was a mark of his new position in the world like louis vi sister marriage to bohemond of antioch it stretched french kinship connections into the new norman colonies ensuring that travellers from the homeland would find a welcome in those distant parts
robert example was a potent one
after the next change in dynasty thierry and philip of alsace strengthened their shaky claim to the comital position by attaining for themselves the prestige attached to being the outstanding crusaders of their generation
thierry remote connection with the family of godfrey de bouillon along with his marriage with sybilla of anjou fulk v daughter gave him some claim to the throne of jerusalem as a consequence the aristocracy of outremer viewed him and philip with mixed feelings expecting much of them yet fearing their ambitions
in the end it was not in outremer but in the newly conquered byzantine empire that the flemish crusading achievement was crowned with the elevation of count baldwin ix to the imperial throne in
but in the twelfth century the house of alsace could afford the high costs of their expeditions thierry went to jerusalem four times philip twice and the counts repeated absences in fact promoted administrative reform the baillis and the grote bref were as much the products of crusading as the english and norman judicial system and exchequers were the product of the divided attentions
but if on balance the flemish counts benefited materially from crusading as arguably did the angevin they were far from typical
for other french houses a commitment to outremer often represented a sacrifice of domestic political interest
the achievements of raymond iv st gilles in consolidating his authority within toulouse were threatened by his departure in especially since it was known that he had no intention of returning home
then his example lured his elder son bertrand to tripoli in and his younger son alphonse jourdain there in
had not his grandson raymond v fulfilled his crusading obligation in his early youth thereby freeing himself from the necessity of interrupting his career in the county the principality of toulouse might have disintegrated altogether
william ix crusade of brought about serious financial problems in aquitaine which caused rapid devaluation in the hitherto stable currency and robert curthose decision to mortgage normandy to william rufus in order to cover his crusading expenses exacerbated a conflict over the duchy which was not settled until the death of his son william clito in
all in all it was not surprising that suger mulling over the precedents of early crusading tried to dissuade louis vii from embarking on his jerusalem journey in
yet the appeal of crusading was if anything even stronger to those aristocratic houses just below the level of the princely it was after all the house of boulogne which produced the first two rulers of jerusalem
the counts of nevers the lords of montpellier the lords of amboise and lusignan the trencavels were fervent devotees of the ideal so the problems of absences shipwrecks death abroad plagued them as much as their princes
on occasion their determination to sacrifice for christ played directly into their overlord hands as when the count of la marche who had no direct heir sold his county to king henry ii in
when it did not accompanying their princes in a joint crusading venture as the lord of amboise accompanied fulk v or hugh vi de lusignan william ix created new personal links
the political from crusading are therefore more difficult to calculate than at first glance they might appear
nevertheless it is clear that the chief gainer was louis vii
the irony of this lay in the fact that the second crusade was in outremer embittered relations with byzantium and resulted in the deaths of enormous numbers of its participants particularly those drawn from the classes
yet it consolidated the king position within france partly through the skilled regency of suger but also because in taking on himself the leadership of the expedition louis as a credible ruler of men
his noble gesture appeased those churchmen who had been appalled by his early obstinacy over the archbishopric of bourges
the disasters that befell his army paradoxically heightened his personal charisma even the barons of outremer continued to look on him as their one potential saviour
his friendship with raymond v of toulouse a fellow warrior reversed the trend of history since the middle of the tenth century in bringing the princes of the far south back into the king mouvance
the crowds of burgundians who accompanied the king learned to respect him on their return they sought the arbitration of the royal court in their disputes and they welcomed louis intervention within the counties that fringed the duchy of burgundy
as william of st denis put it
even as early as it was apparent that the crusading movement had provided a new sense of aristocratic cohesion in the realm
the great joint expeditions the combined leaderships although not without friction had been justified by their outstanding achievement the conquest and maintenance of jerusalem
they were the gesta francorum the deeds of the franks or the gesta dei per francos god deeds performed through the franks as two of their earliest chroniclers entitled them
but what was missing before was a clear sense of who the franks were
the second crusade however was launched with st bernard ringing appeal to the count and barons of brittany
in taking his place at the head of the second crusade the rex francorum decisively hastened the transformation of the franks into the french
revival under law
few contemporaries would have expected balfour retirement to lead to a unionist recovery
the party was in a mutinous condition in november and there was no apparent successor who would have even half of balfour political gifts
nor was it clear that balfour departure was universally desired at the national union conference a few days later leo maxse was booed off the platform and constituency parties everywhere passed resolutions regretting balfour decision
a great many crocodile tears were shed for since unionists had such an elevated view of the principle of leadership they were unable to accept that they had just driven their own leader from office
the shock caused by balfour going thus did something to steady the party and it certainly produced a real determination to settle the affairs of the party with less friction than had been fashionable of late
the main contenders for the leadership were austen chamberlain and walter long representing the two different establishments of the edwardian unionist party the opposite worlds of birmingham and wiltshire but the situation was complicated by the intervention of two outsiders edward carson and andrew bonar law
two strong groups emerged behind long and chamberlain about equal in numbers but there were few backers for carson or law
carson thereupon fell out of the contest or rather announced that he was not standing for no official nominations had been made
the party officers and whips were solidly behind chamberlain but law drew off some of his support among tariff reformers and urged on by edward goulding and max aitken he refused to withdraw unless his continued candidature would allow long to win
against chamberlain it was remembered that he was a liberal unionist as was lansdowne who led the unionists in the lords and that he had not been entirely loyal to balfour since the referendum pledge
long was supported by the bulk of the english county members but by few of the party men of talent
by the morning of friday november it was clear that neither chamberlain nor long would secure a majority and that some supporters of each of them would not contentedly follow the other
a party meeting was to be held on the following monday and the whips were making preparation for a vote to be taken
chamberlain provided the way out by suggesting to balcarres that both he and long should withdraw and so allow law to be elected unanimously he also turned down balcarres remarkable advice that he should allow long to be elected since long would make such a mess of things that chamberlain would be bound to succeed within the year
faced with chamberlain proposition and without a majority of his own long had no option but to agree
bonar law backed by fewer mps than any of the other three contenders at the beginning of the week was now to be the unanimous choice
robert sanders reported the election meeting on november with evident satisfaction
the carlton meeting on monday went off quite admirably
harry chaplin in the chair a very great success
a good many men came into the room by no means inclined to acquiesce in the proposed arrangement
walter long proposed bonar law
his speech was one of the best things i have heard
manly and rather touching
the country gentleman at his best
he spoke and evidently felt strongly of the degradation that it would have been to the parry to have elected a leader by secret ballot
austen followed
when austen sat down chaplin suggested that he had better put the question at once and on getting an affirmative shout did so
a clever way of stifling discussion and few could have done it so well
motion carried unanimously
bonar law then sent for
his speech struck me as the feeblest of the day
he was evidently moved and nervous
the meeting separated in great content with the conservative party all round
it was certainly creditable
the urgency of the events following balfour resignation was due to the need to find a new leader before the national union conference
so within a few days of his grudging acceptance by his parliamentary colleagues law leadership was ratified by the throng of party notables at leeds here he received a reception more typical of what was to come in the future
in law was known in so far as he was known at all in the parliamentary party as a spirited debater
a
taylor has noted that law was trained if he was trained for anything in his early career to be a debater
in glasgow he had picked up many of the skills that a more politician might have acquired in the oxford union or at the bar but skills that were very different in appearance
his concern was solely with effectiveness rather than style he rarely spoke with more than brief notes and left it to the occasion to furnish the words
when he became chancellor of the exchequer this practice caused consternation at the treasury when he used only a page of notes to assist him in moving complicated resolutions on wartime finance he relied successfully on his memory to provide details and figures
as an extempore speaker he was able to tailor his words to his audience reactions and so convey the impression of personal conversation even when addressing thousands
in parliament he was wont to abandon an argument if he sensed that his point had been made the speeches that appear in hansard were touched up by his staff and his speeches in the country were given to the press in advance
in debate he was a formidable opponent and one that asquith was never able to master for all his forensic skills
again law succeeded by unorthodoxy he was quick to grasp the essentials of an opponent argument and quite prepared to be rude or direct if the situation demanded it
in the long debates over marconi in and over the curragh mutiny in law was able to nail asquith evasions where a more polished stylist might have been foiled
occasionally in the onrush of pursuit he gave commitments that were later regretted but these were a small price to pay
the unionist recovery was built around law leadership but what asquith called the new style of obstruction threats and offensive behaviour did not originate with law
the beginnings are to be found in the diehard campaign against the parliament bill
it was in june that the first scenes of disorder were mounted in the house of commons led by lord hugh cecil
in august the diehard peers used language as violent as any that law was to use later and in the crucial decision on the house of lords law sided with the hedgers rather than the ditchers
ulster opposition to home rule long law leadership and he had rarely even spoken on irish affairs in parliament before becoming leader
before he succeeded balfour then law was not associated with any of the features that were to characterize his party leadership his contribution was to use the leadership in the service of all of these causes to make himself the spokesman for the most spirited sections of the party
law conceived of the role of the leader in an exactly opposite sense from balfour he sought to foster unity by placing himself at the head of the discordant elements where balfour had thrown the leadership on the side of restraint
their respective positions explain this in part as minister and a considerable figure in his own right balfour had the confidence to believe in his own judgement even when isolated from the bulk of the party as the tertium quid in the recent contest law had neither the weight nor the confidence to take such a detached view
his strategy was rather to canalize the enthusiasm of the diehards into party channels to articulate their views and to create unity from the sense of movement
in his characteristic phrase i am their leader i must follow them but he determined to follow them from the front
as a result of this he was labelled as a diehard and a bigot when he actually distrusted the diehards and was himself distrusted by the bigots
much of his leadership was thus a form of pragmatic extremism extreme action and the threat of more extreme action to come but used in the cause of more limited objectives
he certainly held deep convictions as to the absolute wrongness of the liberal policies that he opposed but at least a part of his apparent hostility was assumed for the occasion a hard line that might secure a better compromise in the end
so in his first major speech as leader in parliament he wasted little time on the customary compliments and warned the government that he intended to play hard
in private conversation he told asquith i am afraid that i shall have to show myself very vicious mr asquith this session
i hope you will understand
in later conversations about ulster law was frank enough to point out that bloodshed in ulster would be the best way of ensuring an electoral landslide for the unionists
there was then an open toughness about party tactics before the buckingham palace conference in he had central office work out the electoral effects of excluding nine six or four counties of ulster from an independent ireland the concern of a calculating pragmatist not of a bigot
from the party viewpoint law methods were successful but dangerous expectations raised when the party was in full cry were not easily set aside for an eventual compromise and the only outcome that would fully vindicate the methods was the recovery of power
the basis of recovery was then law fighting capacities as leader
in parliament there would be a carefully organized campaign of resistance that would at least slow the government down and raise unionist morale
improved morale would also make possible organizational advances outside parliament all linked to the issue of ulster and with the sights fixed firmly on the next election an election that would make or break the union the empire and law leadership of the party
all was linked to the sense of a new departure a new style a new regime in politics and a new team at the helm as well as a new leader the party had by the middle of a new chief whip party chairman party treasurer principal agent press adviser and an almost entirely new team of whips and organizers
party organization provided the easiest advances because it was the only area entirely under the party control
no general election was fought by the organization set up after but there is little doubt that there was a massive improvement criticisms that were commonplace in were not to be heard by
the space available to central office was increased by the acquisition of st stephen house as well as st stephen chambers which had been occupied since the new office cost a year in rent alone
the quality of the senior staff was improved by the appointment of three specialists
john boraston took over as principal agent in having been a professional organizer all his career and latterly chief agent to the liberal unionist council
he joined william jenkins appointed chief organizing agent in and previously district agent for the midlands liberal unionists
the party was indeed handed over to birmingham
finally malcolm fraser of the standard and of the daily express became first honorary press adviser and subsequently was employed to run the press bureau at the colossal salary of
boraston jenkins and fraser made up a team of experts all of sufficient status to deal with politicians who might call into the office the work of the office was departmentalized for the first time and the heads of department brought together into a supervising board
the influence of central office toned up the rest of the organization
a new canvass system was introduced in so that all county constituencies would operate the same system and so that duplicate records could be kept at area level
this was important at a time when outvoters were a larger group in many constituencies than the size of the majority and when the outvoters were overwhelmingly unionist
in a register of car owners was compiled also important when some voters could cast several votes in an election when polling went several days
by november only constituencies in great britain were without candidates a much better position than the position at dissolution in either or few of these constituencies were winnable but in any case most of them had candidates by the end of
a programme of speakers for a general election was also ready by with both constituencies and politicians told in advance what they might expect
the financial mismanagement that had reigned before was ended with the employment of professional accountants
expenditure on central office district offices and the london office doubled from in to in the total expenditure of the party organization from central funds also doubled from to over
to pay for this outpouring a great drive was mounted for additional income farquhar and
in ordinary subscriptions still brought in only a year and it proved difficult to raise them to anything like what was needed
the method adopted was to canvass for capital donations that could then be invested to bring in a regular income and both balfour and law were used to raise the wind
told balfour that farquhar and i are endeavouring to raise more money
i think we are likely to succeed thanks in part to the very generous example set by lord rothschild
but i would b e very glad if i might see you on your return to ask you to help me in two cases
systematic collections were made from peers and from the city by the outbreak of war the invested funds amounted to twice the sum in and worth four years expenditure and there was a special cash deposit of for the coming election
in three other areas as much political as organizational advances were made towards the management of the press the coordination of the heterogeneous collection that made up the party and the fostering of modern attitudes in the local parties
under malcolm fraser the party began to make effective use of its support in fleet street
it had been recognized that liberals had been more adept at handling the press because they were more ready to stoop to newspaper practices as sandars had reported in
i told northcliffe that if his people would make enquiries at our central office he would find that our nightly regiment of speakers was at least as well worth reporting as the radical contingent but that i realized that from the press point of view no doubt our speakers did not play up to the reporters by handing them their speeches in advance and by other tricks of the kind to which the radical orators have recourse
this was the essence of the problem the press could only be managed by someone who knew their methods and who would not expect them to come round to central office to search for news
the uoc found that it is patent that some feeling exists among the unionist press that while in the past they have done much for the party the party has not assisted in their work
in many quarters it is asserted that the unionist press are treated with greater courtesy by the radicals than by their own side
fraser dealt with this problem without difficulty and explained to law in that the importance of getting important speeches in advance is shown in concrete manner by your wallsend speech on october
the verbatim reports reached most of the newspapers in places such as aberdeen at one o clock in the morning of the
he went on to quote the response that had been received from editors
manchester dispatch i hope you will continue this form of enterprise
you fully know as an old pressman the difficulty of dealing with a big speech late at night
daily express i am much obliged to you for the precis of mr bonar law speech last night
it was a great help to us
the speech came over the wires so late and the sheets were so confused by the post office which is usual in these cases that without the precis we could not possibly have got the leader through in time for the first edition
so in the supply of information to newspapers predisposed to support the party much was achieved merely by employing a specialist
the other side of press management depending on informal contacts is less easy to assess
in invited blumenfeld of the daily express to central office for a exchange of ideas and advice
he also used law himself to impress editors who were on less familiar terms with fraser as with marlowe of the daily mail and law took a direct interest in negotiations with the most difficult of all the unionist editors garvin of the observer
law personally conducted the negotiations with gardner sinclair over the sale of the observer and the pall mall gazette in this negotiation also demonstrates that as well as producing information and nursing editors the party had to work hard to keep some of the newspapers in business
sinclair did buy the observer and the pall mall in the end but not before he had been given a guarantee from party funds
such investments had a double purpose for they could bring in income and provide a political bonus
one such scheme involved the purchase of the daily express by max aitken with party funds but the party was also propping up the globe the standard and a wide range of provincial dailies
all these transactions were secret for there would be little use in keeping a paper alive if it were known to be owned by a political party
the papers were therefore bought through nominees or bank loans backed with party capital
it was usual to extract some form of guarantee in exchange for party support but the secrecy prevented such undertakings from being enforced
sinclair thus gave an undertaking that his papers would always remain unionist but doubted if such a promise had any value
the later history of the daily express suggests not when the express became hostile in the younger raged when i think of the large sum of money this office has put into that gutter print it makes my blood boil
the justification for pouring out large sums without a certain return was the even greater cost of any real alternative
the support for the express in provides for the introduction of or to retain the only paper the party possesses in london and no less a sum than to would be necessary to start a similar paper if the daily express were allowed to go
the struggle therefore went on to keep the unionist press alive and in and both aitken and northcliffe stood by the party and gave valuable support in their papers
the coordination of competing party bodies was carried out with surprising ease
the national union was merged with central office in and fusion with the liberal unionists followed in
joseph chamberlain retained his preference for independence but allowed himself to be overruled by austen and by the overwhelming wishes of the liberal unionist council to merge
to cater for all susceptibilities the party became the national unionist association of conservative and unionist associations a decision that allowed some local parties to go on calling themselves conservative but the name liberal was at last dropped
the liberal unionists were admitted to the carlton club and a longstanding source of tension was eradicated
this was in itself a striking commentary on what had already been done liberal unionists who had resisted amalgamation under balfour and in acquiesced meekly under law and in
other organizations could not be absorbed but could still be brought within the central office orbit
so in offered to join the halsbury club in order to guide it on to safer lines and was immediately accused of disloyalty by walter long
long helped though by placing both and boraston on the executive committee of the union defence league for the same purpose
also explained to lord robert cecil that it has been arranged that the national conservative union should send out leaflets produced by several of the ancillary organizations such as the tariff reform league the union the primrose league the london municipal society etc
the central office attitude was flexible for outside bodies would always exist and could even be made use of
they represent a time when either their objects were not the same as those of the official organization or the cco was not enterprising enough to suit them
but some caution should be observed
it may be wise while retaining or regaining control to trade under different names
in some cases additional subscriptions may be obtained in others full responsibility may be avoided
with open allies like the primrose league the case for collaboration was strong for the first time in thirty years of existence the primrose league formally linked itself with the party in
on the other hand the independence of the tariff reform league was a positive advantage after january the party supported the tariff policy but was not including them in its immediate programme so that central office could continue to distribute tariff propaganda from the trl without compromising party policy
in general efforts to ensure better coordination were a matter of the patient building up of contacts although the improved party morale and the greater efficiency of central office had removed their justification for existence

steady currents

the basic equations
in this chapter we shall be concerned with phenomena in which the main role is played by the current of charged particles
all our variables can be functions of space but are independent of time
it is easy to present the relevant equations we have all of eqns but have to substitute o yielding formula
there is a difficulty with eqn
it is correct for most of the chapter with formula taken as a constant but breaks down for ferromagnetic materials which will be discussed in section
all the other equations are all right but will not necessarily provide the simplest starting point for solving a given problem
we shall therefore introduce a number of alternative formulations
first we could search for some analogue of the potential function which proved so useful in electrostatics
we found there that by choosing a scalar function in the form formula we could automatically satisfy the other equation for the electric field strength formula
can we do the same thing for the magnetic quantities
no but we can do a similar thing
since it is the equation formula that needs to be satisfied we should choose the potential as a vector called not without logic the vector potential defined by the equation formula
substituting the above equation into eqn we get formula or using the vector relation eqn we obtain the modified form formula
this equation can be further simplified to formula by choosing in the physicist jargon this is called choosing the gauge formula
can we do that
one ca usually assign some arbitrary value to the divergence of a vector function
in the present case however we do have some freedom of choice
the definition of a by eqn is not unique
if we add to a the gradient of a scalar function the resulting vector a still gives the same magnetic field because formula
hence a suitable choice of will ensure that formula
so we are left with eqn
if the current density is specified eqn will provide the solution for a from which b can be determined
how can we find a solution for a
there is nothing easier
we only need to remember the differential equation for the scalar potential formula eqn and its solution in the form of eqn
by analogy the general solution of eqn is formula
a simple integration will yield a if j is given
we shall go through a number of examples later
for the moment let us use the above expression for deriving law
first we shall assume that the current density is confined to a thin wire in which case the integration variable may be changed to formula where s is a vector normal to the formula is the area of the and di is an elementary vector along the tangent of the wire
noting further that i and that i must be constant along the wire we may write eqn in the modified form formula whence the magnetic field strength is formula
we have to stop here for a moment to sort out the coordinates
as may be seen in fig the coordinates of the wire element are x y z whereas the coordinates of the point where we wish to determine the magnetic field are set of coordinates
thus the curl operates on the coordinates of p but not on those of dl leading to formula where ir is the unit vector in the direction r and we have made use of the vector relation in the appendix
this is law derived directly from maxwell equations
are there any other ways of determining the magnetic field
well one can use eqn as it is but very often one is better off by using its integral form that can be obtained by integrating both sides of eqn over a surface formula
by using stokes theorem for the and recognizing that the integral of the current density gives the current the above equation reduces to formula where the line integration is along the curve c enclosing the surface
the positive sense of the integration path is defined relative to the positive current direction according to the usual convention
equation is known as law
we have now a number of equations describing the same thing
which equation should we use in a practical case the equation for the vector potential law law or attack directly maxwell equations
it hard to tell
experience with practical calculations helps but even after years of work one usually remains this side of infallibility
i regret to say that there are no general guidelines available
if one manages to find the simplest method at the first attempt that can mostly be attributed to good luck
can we claim then that the vector potential is as useful as its scalar counterpart in electrostatics
for computational purposes the answer is an unambiguous no
it is always laborious to find the components of a vector so we are not much better off with a than with h or b it turns out however that a is a more basic quantity of physics than b since b is given by the curl of a it is possible that a is finite while its curl is zero
interestingly under these conditions a has an effect on certain phenomena
it would be unfair both to the vector potential and to quantum mechanics to say that none of those formulations have engineering applications in fact the most sensitive magnetometer built to date is based on that kind of theory but by and large engineers would lose much sleep if the use of a were banned with immediate effect
the vector potential is not a popular variable among engineers maybe because it is not directly measurable
there are no instruments capable to measure the magnitude or direction of a
in my opinion a is a useful thing if used with moderation
it helped us to derive law it will come handy later in solving certain radiation problems and it often leads to nice formulae for the magnetic flux crossing a surface defined as formula that may be rewritten in terms of the vector potential as follows formula where c is the curve enclosing the surface
we have now collected a good number of formulae which will serve us well in the following sections
before going on just a few words about the classification of steady currents
it may be roughly divided into two parts magnetostatics and the rest
we shall discuss the rest first sections and that will give us some idea of the relative significance of electric and magnetic fields
sections are concerned with magnetostatics where electric fields are assumed to be zero and the interrelationship of j h and b are studied
since we have so many variables and since in each physical configuration only some of them appear we will record just for this chapter the variables in each section heading

the defocusing of an electron beam j e d p h b
we have so far talked about positive and negative charges about point charges and distributed charge
i shall now introduce the concept of an elementary charge c carried by an elementary particle called the electron
this is not a necessity
it is possible to study electromagnetic theory without ever mentioning the word electron but since it has become such a household word and is used so often we can just as well make use of it
in the present section we shall consider a cylindrical electron beam of radius a in which the charge density is uniform p po and all electrons travel with velocity v
we are not going to enquire into the details how such beams can be produced it belongs to the subject of physical electronics we shall accept the fact that the beam exists and will try to work out the forces on the outermost electrons
there is now cylindrical symmetry and a net charge per unit length formula yielding for the radial component of the electric field formula
the magnetic field may be obtained from law eqn as follows formula where the line integral is taken over the circle of radius a fig i is the total current of the beam and formula is the azimuthal component of the magnetic field in the cylindrical coordinate system specified by formula
from eqn we get formula
the electric force on an electron of charge e travelling at the edge of the beam r a is it is in the radial direction pointing outwards
the magnetic force is perpendicular both to the direction of motion axis and the direction of magnetic field formula direction
the vectorial product v x b gives an inward force in the radial direction
hence the net force on the electron is formula
noting that formula and anticipating the relationship formula to be derived in section we get the following formula for the force formula where c is the velocity of light
it may be seen from the above equation that the magnetic force is negligible in comparison with the electric force unless the velocity of the electron approaches the velocity of light
thus the conclusion is that owing to the repulsive forces between the electrons a cylindrical electron beam is unstable
using a technical term borrowed from electron optics we could say that the electron beam gets defocused
the other conclusion as far as it is permissible to generalize from a single example is more important in principle
it is concerned with the relative magnitudes of electric and magnetic forces
since charged particles rarely travel close to the velocity of light we may conclude that the magnetic forces are by orders of magnitude smaller than the electric forces
why is it then that we have no difficulties in practice in observing magnetic fields
the reason is of course that there are two kinds of electric charges and their effect usually cancels so the small magnetic field has a chance of getting observed
and that brings us to the ext example
pinch effect j h b
in contrast to our previous example we shall now investigate a cylindrical beam consisting of two kinds of charge carriers negative electrons and some positive particles which i do not wish to be more precise about at the moment
we shall assume that the two kinds of particles have equal densities and move in opposite directions
as a result there is no net space charge and hence no electric field
the currents on the other hand do not cancel because they represent opposite charges moving in opposite directions remember minus one times minus one is equal to plus one
the magnetic field strength is given again by eqn we only need to substitute for the current in ip where the subscripts n and p refer to negative and positive particles respectively
hence the magnetic force on the electron at the edge of the beam at r a is formula and on the positive particle is formula
note that the force is inwards and in the same direction for both particles
let us distinguish two cases
both particles are mobile
in that case both of them will move inwards under the effect of magnetic force
but if the diameter of the beam is reduced eqns and tell us that the forces are even larger
what happens then
if everything was uniform then the beam diameter would go on decreasing
in practice however the beam is not uniform and does not possess perfect cylindrical symmetry
under these conditions the motion of the particles is fairly complicated and of course our model is unable to predict the detailed behaviour of the particles
nevertheless a few qualitative conclusions may be drawn without doing any further mathematics
if the happens to be smaller at a certain place then the forces are larger there than at the neighbouring so the beam will be further constricted etc leading to the sausage instability fig a
if the magnetic field happens to be larger at one side than at the other side then the beam will be deflected towards the weaker field which makes the field even weaker etc leading to the kink instability fig b
the positive particle is immobile
in practice this means that the positive ions are part of the crystal lattice
there is then no magnetic force on the ions only on the electrons
so the electrons want to move inwards but can not because the ions hold them back by virtue of their electrostatic attraction
naturally if the ions attract the electrons the converse is true as well owing to the magnetic force on the electrons there is also an inward force upon the ions
so the whole crystal structure tries to contract or in other words the material is under pressure see example
in any practical situation this pressure is small and can be neglected when calculating the forces on conductors

flow patterns and ohm law j e d
up to now we have not enquired into the question of how the current arose
we just assumed that certain charge carriers moved with certain velocities
now we shall say that in a class of materials the current density at any point is proportional to the electric field in mathematical form formula where formula is the conductivity of the material
the above equation is spite of its utmost simplicity represents an extremely good guess
it is valid for nearly all materials up to quite high electric fields
will there be a magnetic field
yes of course whenever there is a current there is a magnetic field as well
but the effect of the magnetic field upon the motion of the electrons is nearly always negligible one exception causing the pinch effect is mentioned in the previous section
thus we may safely ignore the magnetic field when determining the lines of current flow
we are then left with only one equation formula or formula or formula depending on our preference
eqn tells us that there is some analogy see example with the electrostatic case treated in chapter
we may in fact reinterpret any of the diagrams of figs by assuming that the whole space is filled with a material of conductivity formula and the field lines are now the lines of current flow as well
is the analogy perfect
not really because as current flows there is some potential drop in the electrode itself zero conductivity for part of the space can not be electrostatically modelled since there are no dielectrics with er and when current flows through two materials of different conductivity there is generally a surface charge at the boundary see example
it is not worth discussing any of these complications because one is rarely called upon to work out lines of current in a conductor
we shall rather return to a very simple geometrical configuration for deriving ohm law
we shall take a piece of cylindrical material of length l and s and apply a voltage between the ends
the electric field is then formula the current density formula and the current formula
from circuit theory formula where r is the resistance of the material
comparing eqns and we get formula
since formula is by definition the resistivity we get the result you learned in school that the electrical resistance is proportional to the resistivity and the length of the sample and inversely proportional to its
a more general definition of resistance valid for varying may be easily arrived at but it is hardly worth the trouble
the essential thing is that the relation formula is equivalent to ohm law
risking the dismay of circuit engineers some theoreticians do in fact refer to eqn as ohm law
prologue
royal academy of arts london
he signed the friends book in his elegant handwriting alexander wedderburn january
she had said peremptory as always that he was to go straight to room iii where the miraculous stuff was to be found
early
so here he was a distinguished public man also an artist of a kind stepping obediently through room i french and room ii british and on a lead grey morning to the pale grey classical quiet place where the bright light shone and sang off pigment so that the phrase miraculous stuff seemed merely accurate
on one long wall hung a row of van goghs including an arles poets garden he had seen before but recognised from small photographs from charged descriptions in the painter letters
he sat down and saw a bifurcated path simmering with gold heat round and under the rising spreading vanes of a great pine still widening where the frame interrupted its soaring
two decorous figures advanced under its suspended thickness
and beyond green grass and geraniums like splashes of blood
alexander was not worried about whether frederica would turn up
she was no longer in the habit of being late her life had schooled her to temporal accuracy perhaps to being considerate
he himself at felt not quite accurately that he was now too old too settled to be put out by her or by anyone else
he thought with warmth of her certain approach
there had been a pattern an only too discernible repetition in the events and relationships of his life into which she had ruggedly refused to fit
she had been a nuisance a threat a torment and was now a friend
she had suggested that they look at van gogh together setting up another form of repetition deliberate contrived and aesthetic
his play the yellow chair had first been presented in he did not like to think too closely about it as he did not like to think too closely about any of his past work
he stared at the serenely impassioned garden made out of a whirl of yellow brushstrokes a viridian impasto a dense mass of furiously feathered lines of isolated black pot hooks the painfully clear spattering
he had trouble finding an appropriate language for the painter obsession with the illuminated material world
he would have been lying if he had recorded only the more accessible drama of the painter electric quarrels with gauguin in the yellow house in arles the distant necessary brother who supplied paint and love the severed ear delivered to the whore in the brothel the asylum fears
at first he had thought that he could write a plain exact verse with no figurative language in which a yellow chair was the thing itself a yellow chair as a round gold apple was an apple or a sunflower a sunflower
sometimes he still saw the brushstrokes as it were in this naked way so that his earlier thoughts of this garden had to be undone the idea of black wings to be stripped from the painted leafage the vulgar idea of blood splashes washed off the notation of geraniums
but it could be done
language was against him for a start
metaphor lay coiled in the name sunflower which not only turned towards but resembled the sun the source of light
van gogh idea of things had also been against him
the yellow chair besides being brushstrokes and pigment besides being a yellow chair was one of twelve bought for a company of artists who were to inhabit the yellow house the white walls of which should blaze with sunflowers as the windows of gothic cathedrals blazed with coloured light
not only metaphor cultural motif immanent religion a faith and a church
one thing always linked to another thing
as the poets garden a decoration for the bedroom of the poet gauguin was more than it seemed
some time ago i read an article on dante petrarch boccaccio and botticelli
good lord it did make an impression on me reading the letters of those men
arles
and petrarch lived quite near here in avignon and i am seeing the same cypresses and oleanders
there is still a great deal of greece all through the tartarin and daumier part of this queer country where the good folks have the accent you know there is a venus of arles just as there is a venus of lesbos and one still feels the youth of it in spite of all
but is it true this garden has a fantastic character which makes you quite able to imagine the poets of the renaissance strolling among these bushes and over the flowery grass
the youth of it alexander thought
i thought i was then
in july two years after writing this van gogh had shot himself inefficiently in the groin and had died slowly
in alexander a man had read the centenary edition of the letters
he had himself been rising and when the yellow chair was put on had passed that age was older now than van gogh as he had in the realised that he was older than keats
he had felt perhaps briefly the power of the survivor
what nonsense
the eternal youth of provence
he thought of thick fat hot motorways carving up that land
he turned his attention to the timeless fields of wheat and olives
she made a kind of progress up the palladian marble stair
a painter stopped to kiss her a journalist waved
john house who had organised the exhibition came almost leaping down the stairs accompanied by a smallish woman in a coat
he also kissed frederica and introduced the woman fumbling her name as a colleague and frederica as frederica you must forgive me i never know what name you re working under women these days are so protean
frederica did not attempt to ascertain the fumbled name having given up interest in stray new people until it was clear that they were of real concern
she assumed wrongly that john house colleague was an art historian
the colleague looked at frederica with an apparently scanning attention
john house spoke of the history of the gathering of the images an emptiness here jacob wrestling the angel an unexpected illumination there
frederica listened attentively went on and signed the visitors book
frederica potter radio critics forum
she negotiated a free catalogue
she made her leisurely way towards where she had told alexander to be
an old woman armed with a sound guide became quite excited and pulled at the arm of another
hey look at that winston churchill painted that the carefully cap
frederica dipped round her to stare claude monet au cap par vent de mistral
a whirl of blue and rose for in less formed plungings of water and wind
to paint she remembered from proust description of fictive elstir that one does not see what one sees
to paint light and air between ourselves and objects
i said dear winston churchill the second woman tugged free of the clutching fingers
not to be mentioned in the same breath with she said looking nervously from frederica to painted signature
the arrested water shone and danced
in the catalogue john house quoted monet description of the painted light around the snowy haystacks as an enveloping veil
he also quoted i think that there should be only allusion
to name an object is to suppress of the enjoyment of the poem which is created by the gradual pleasure of apprehending it
to suggest it that is the dream
it was not a view of things with which frederica was entirely in sympathy she liked naming names
but she looked briefly down dazzled by the flowing skin of worked and delicate colour the blue and rose tourbillons of the mistral on the sea the prismatically sliced frosty nimbus round the mysterious squat stacks
she scribbled words notes in the margin of her catalogue
daniel bought a ticket and paid for the hire of a catalogue he was sure why
he had come he believed because he needed to discuss certain administrative problems with frederica
he was aware that she believed he was in need of art
under his arm he carried a folded newspaper with that day headline peace mother dies
he was raw to bad news more raw as he grew older which was not perhaps quite what he had expected
he saw and did not see the paintings
there was a field of poppies and corn which reminded him only of small and large faded and ghostly versions of van gogh harvest which he had seen repeated in endless hospital corridors waiting rooms school offices
he had seen these ample fields as he had seen cezanne geometric brown and green undergrowth in more than one mental hospital day room
odd he thought considering that van gogh himself had died mad and despairing in such surroundings
not serene overexcited these fields
daniel patience with the nervously ill was not what it had been
although he was fourteen years younger than alexander daniel too was in the habit of thinking of himself as a survivor a battered and grizzled survivor
alexander saw her coming towards him
a dozen or so schoolgirls were dutifully filling in xeroxed questionnaires
alexander always a connoisseur of garments realised that frederica had changed her style that the clothes the young creatures were wearing could be described as a parody of the clothes frederica had worn at their age and that frederica new style was not unrelated to this shift
there she was in a conventional suit fine dark wool muted geometrical pattern in greens and unexpected straw browns caught in at the waist still very thin to give the effect of a bustle the skirt long and straight to the knee
she had ruffles not swashbuckling at the neck and the small velvet hat could but did not support a veil
the pale red hair was in a figure of eight chignon in her neck reminiscent of one of cafe
fifties and thought alexander connecting
she came up and kissed him
he remarked on the
she took the point eagerly
my dear i know
pencil skirts and batwing sweaters and spiky stilettos tottering with their hard little behinds sticking out and all that red lipstick
i remember when i thought lipstick had gone forever a dream of painted excess as i thought paper taffeta had gone forever in cambridge when we all took to glazed cotton
do you remember
of course
do you remember the eclectic sixties parodies when we went to the national portrait gallery everything from swamis to and too
these are such a serious and uniform parody
more and more of the same
more of me

and you
you have reverted to type
oh i in my element
i understand the fifties
i could do the forties bit at all padded shoulders and crãªpy things ugh and pageboys i think it must have been purely oedipal those were my parents things dammit what i was getting away from
this is my scene
so it is
and now i have money
in our new austerity you have money
in our new austerity i am old enough to have money
they saw daniel advancing
daniel does change said alexander
sometimes i wish he did said frederica
daniel did not change
he wore the same black clothes baggy corduroys heavy sweater jacket that he had worn through the sixties and seventies
like many hirsute men he had thinned a little on top where once his black fur had been extravagant but he had a plentiful and prickling black beard and his body was still compact and very heavy
he looked in this setting a little like some painter
he saluted frederica and alexander with his rolled newspaper and said that it was cold outside
frederica kissed him too reflecting that he was dressed like a man who smelled dirty but in fact did
alexander smelled still of old spice and a sort of agreeable toastiness
his smooth brown hair was as thick as ever but shot now with needles of glittering silver
we must talk said daniel
first you must look at the pictures
take time off
i keep trying
i went to the king carol service
good for you
frederica glanced shrewdly at him
now look at the pictures
gauguin man with the axe
one for you said frederica to alexander still skimming the necessary accompanying print
androgynous
john house says
no gauguin said
do you think
alexander considered the decorative gold body itself a repetition of a body on the parthenon frieze
he saw a blue loincloth flat breasts purple sea with coral tracings lying flatly on it
he was unmoved though the colours were rich and strange
he told frederica he preferred his androgynes to be more obscured more veiled more suggested and directed her attention to fete gloanec in which various inanimate objects two ripe pears a dense bunch of flowers swam across a bright red rimmed with a black ellipse
the picture was signed madeleine bernard and alexander told frederica that gauguin had flirted seriously with that young woman had characterised her as was fashionable at the time as having the desirable unattainable androgynous perfection complete sensuality combined with unattainable
frederica informed him from the catalogue that the vegetation was supposed to be a jocular portrait by gauguin of madeleine the pears her breasts the dense flowers her hair
you could read it another way said alexander interested now you could read the pears as androgynous in themselves as partly male
and the hair as other hair said frederica loudly scandalising a few bystanders amusing a few more
you like to cork for your images do you alexander
it age said alexander peaceably untruthfully
they were beginning to attract a penumbra of as though they were offering a guided tour
they moved on to the olive pickers
daniel mind was elsewhere
he remembered a straight mass of hair in cold king chapel more golden than foxy frederica slowly settling onto a collar as the pins released their grip
he saw a mass of freckles sometimes melding into brown patches of warmth moving over the hard frame of cheekbones and brow
the sexless voices rose in the cold
unto us a boy is born
herod then with wrath was filled
the voices played with the slaughter of the innocents treble and descant hunting each other while she bowed her head unable to sing in tune
the olives had been painted from the asylum at st in
as for me i tell you as a friend i feel impotent when confronted with such nature for my northern brains were oppressed by a nightmare in those peaceful spots as i felt one ought to do better things with the foliage
yet i did not want to leave things alone entirely without making an effort but it is restricted to the expression of two things the cypresses the olive trees let others who are better and more powerful than i reveal their symbolic language
look here there is another question that comes to mind
who are the human beings that actually live among the olive the orange the lemon orchards
frederica and alexander held a discussion of natural supernaturalism
daniel looked at the pink sky the twisted trunks the silvery leaves the rhythmic earth streaked with yellow ochre with pink with pale blue with
olives frederica agreed with alexander could not recall the mount of olives the garden of gethsemane in the day of van gogh the pastor son the lay preacher
as the cypresses must always differently mean death
daniel asked for politeness really why van gogh had been mad was it just that he was driven
alexander said that it may have been a form of epilepsy exacerbated by the disturbances of the mistral and the heat
or you could make a freudian explanation
he felt guilty towards the child who had not survived for whom he had been named
he had been born on march
his dead brother vincent van gogh had been born on march
he was in flight from his family his dead alter ego his uncertain sense of identity
he wrote to theo i hope you are not a van gogh
essentially i am not a van gogh
i have always looked upon you as theo daniel said he could not see the pain frederica said was in the olives and alexander still lecturing said that vincent had objected to paintings of symbolic christs in gethsemane by bernard and his had torn up his own had made do with the olives themselves
he told daniel about the terrible st painting of the blasted tree about and daniel said that it was odd that these orchards should be all over the walls of other asylums now to cheer people up
the trees stood under their haloes of pink and green strokes small flying things solidified light movements or saccades of the eye brushstrokes pigment
here is a description of a canvas which is in front of me at the moment
a view of the park of the asylum where i am staying on the right a grey terrace and a side wall of the house
some deflowered rose bushes on the left a stretch of the park the soil scorched by the sun covered with fallen pine needles
this edge of the park is planted with large whose trunks and branches are the foliage green gloomed over by an admixture of black
these high trees stand out against an evening sky with violet stripes on a yellow ground which higher up turns into pink into green
a wall also shuts off the view and is topped only by a violet and hill
now the nearest tree is an enormous trunk struck by lightning and
but one side branch shoots up very high and lets fall an avalanche of dark green pine needles
this sombre giant like a defeated proud man contrasts when considered in the nature of a living creature with the pale smile of a last rose on the fading bush in front of him
to emile barnard st december
you will realise that this combination of of green gloomed over by grey the black streaks surrounding the contours produces something of the sensation of anguish called from which certain of my companions in misfortune frequently suffer
i am telling you about this to remind you that one can try to give an impression of anguish without aiming straight at the historic garden of gethsemane
daniel thought about dead ann maguire who like anna van gogh the dutch pastor wife had named a younger hopeful child for a dead one
though in van gogh case the names theodorus vincent vincent theodorus appeared and reappeared from generation to generation the cultural parallels to certain persisting aspects of the family face a heavy brow an intense blue eye a cheek bone a nostril
in the churchyard in his last parish a family in the english had tried to name a son walter cornelius brittain and had buried three aged five aged two aged one month interspersed by variegated dead daughters a jennet a marian an eva
in august a car containing an ira gunman possibly already dead ploughed onto a pavement and killed three of mrs maguire children joanne eight john two andrew six weeks leaving one son mark aged seven
people had been shocked by numbers as well as by gratuitous death itself as people will be and mrs maguire sister and a friend had founded the peace people whose brave beginning and sad end will not be chronicled here
ann maguire had borne a second joanne in new zealand from where she had returned unable to bear cultural transplantation
although the papers referred to her as the peace mother she had not been active in the peace people
she had brought a case for legal compensation for her dead children lives and for her own suffering and one of her few recorded public utterances was to call the first offer of compensation pitiful
the day of the hearing of her second case she had been found dead
daniel had pieced the story together from the radio with throat wounds
foul play was not suspected and from conflicting newspapers
with
with a carving knife
with an electric by her side
her motives the coroner was to say were not completely easy to understand
daniel who had become a specialist in wild blows of chance thought he understood some of it
he had not prayed for ann maguire
he was not that kind of priest
he had metaphorically shaken a large fist impotently at some looming and got on with his work his work
he followed the other two into the dark shadows of the room housing the low countries
nuns ascended and descended a cool grey stair in winged white caps
the lauriergracht in amsterdam was gloomed and glittering
mondriaan evening was sombre and cloudy
he liked these
like vincent although he was unaware that vincent had remarked on it he had northern brains and responded biologically and spiritually to tones of black varied greys touches of white in dark
one of the most beautiful things done by the painters of this country has been the painting of black which nevertheless has light in it vincent had written from holland
xavier mellery the painter of the nuns was described in the catalogue as creating a light which is the negation of that which envelops our immediate visual experience of things it is rather the interior light of your mind
daniel was used to such language it was his daily or anyway weekly pabulum
he knew about the light shining in darkness and had come for reasons completely different from alexander desire for exactness specificity to mistrust figurative language
he never now made a sermon from a metaphor nor drew analogies he preached examples cases lessons
but he liked the black dutch paintings they were so to speak on his wavelength
he cornered frederica
a postcard yes
where this time
kenya
on the way to the ugandan famine i think
hippie said daniel
helping out said frederica
what use comparatively is a chap like that wi no training no medical no
another mouth to feed
it makes me wild
i think he is often useful in his way
you judge him so he judges me
judging runs in the family
it does said frederica
once said daniel i was in charing cross hospital someone kid had taken an overdose and died they pump them out there regular as clockwork but this one liver could take any more
anyway there i was going up this endless corridor thinking what to do about the mother who blamed herself wi reason mind you she was one of those soft suckering but that made it worse not better and there was th trolley wi the dead girl on it sliding by me sheet right over porters in those soft theatre boots and floppy plastic bathcaps and when they got past me and were turning i door the first one looked at me from under his plastic frills like with my own face
i was shocked for a minute
got all his hair tucked up in that thing you see otherwise he not so like me not strikingly so
hi he said
going about your father business are you
so i asked him what he was up to and he said he was going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down in it and then he pushed th trolley in and i went in after and the mother began her howling and shrieking and will said well i walk off and leave you to it
and i said where are you going then
and he said i told you
to and fro
that was the last i saw of will
the nuns ascended the stairs in a perpetual cool silence
quoting scripture for his own purposes said daniel
that was rather funny i thought said frederica
anything on the postcard about coming back
any plans
no
sometimes she wished will would not write to her at all if he would send no messages to daniel
sometimes she told herself the postcards or exercise book scrawls were messages to daniel but one should never she considered ignore surface meanings in favour of implications and the damned things were addressed to her to frederica
oh hell she said
not to worry said daniel
i push off
i see you
you have seen the pictures
i not in the mood
we were going to have coffee in fortnum and mason
no thank you all the same
wednesday january
clare still swapped one night a week off with stephanie and reported subsequent events to gilda who now managed the shoe shop occasionally she visited clare for an evening meal
as clare poured sherry gilda asked so how was the boac pilot
tony was the worst yet
clare never felt embarrassed discussing sex with gilda who could talk about little else
he read all the sex manuals ever printed
whipped a porn magazine out of his flight case after the first gin and tonic
he was coldly determined to be a good lover
for me that was a total
porn pictures are a to most women
women like words not pictures gilda said as she sipped her drink
but i starting to think that everything a for you doll
you clearly ca have sex with fellas you ai fond of
i expect you need a chap you know well someone you feel comfortable with not these
she swallowed half the glass
now me i the reverse
if i do give a damn about em i ai anxious and if i ai anxious then i come easy
she drained her glass
when tony could get me to climax he wanted to ask another girl over clare said
he automatically assumed that i was a lesbian
that not what he meant gilda said
lots of guys find it a to watch two women making love
how very odd
can you imagine a woman trying to get two men into bed so she could watch them
forget this guy said gilda
i know what you need clare someone you know and trust someone who wo make you feel anxious
then you relax and it happen then you stop being one of them miserable nymphos who hop from man to man hoping for mr right the man who can satisfy her
as gilda held out her glass to be refilled she added reflectively although you seem more lonely than horny
are you looking for sex or just someone to talk to
you ai likely to pick up prince charming in a bar
clare said i not looking for prince charming
i do want the disorder the pain the mess or the misery of being in love
i just want a relationship without responsibility
gilda laughed
so do these fellas you pick up
but i not convinced that right for you
you need a secure situation with someone you can trust who you know will stick around because he loves you
i tell you who you ought to fall in love with clare
who
yourself
you clearly think that you a piece of worthless rubbish and if i pick up those vibes then so do the blokes
why not give sex a rest for a bit and pay a bit of attention to yourself
you never want to make a man the centre of your existence
that place is for you clare
i am the centre of my existence clare sang as if chanting a psalm pitching her voice an octave lower as she pushed josh to her playgroup the next morning
a man stood on the porch his hands in the pocket of his beige mackintosh
good morning
are you a prospective parent
clare asked
she felt in her pocket for the key
no said the man
i an inspector for the local education authority
after examining the bathroom the inspector pointed out that legally one toilet was required for every seven kiddies
clare said but if each child goes there every two and a half hours one lavatory is adequate
there is a potty for emergencies
we have never had a problem
the inspector was not listening
he was making notes on other violations
half an hour after the inspector left as if to prove his point the lavatory refused to flush
the following morning clare playgroup was ordered to close
two days later clare mind was unexpectedly diverted from her personal problems no job no man when the cnd office telephoned to ask her for voluntary evening help they were organizing another protest after a nuclear accident
over spain an american bomber carrying an had collided in with another aircraft
the with an explosive capacity of more than a million tons of tnt had fallen into the atlantic ocean off southern spain
clare felt cheered to be back among people doing something worth while
monday february
valentine day brought two happy events
the radio reported that the missing had been located on the atlantic seabed
and to clare delight she sold the lease of the apartment in which she ran her playgroup for a profit of per cent
clare felt as if she had won a sweepstake
on the following morning she bought a portable tv a warm winter coat for herself and new clothes for josh
she did buy any toys for josh because she had decided to open a toy shop
two weeks later clare bought the short lease of a small shop in the pimlico road close to mrs gooden home
though there was a lot to do clare busy redecorating the shop and visiting wholesalers to buy stock still managed to work one evening a week for the movement
in just before her toy shop opened clare weary amiable national health doctor looked up from his desk and said about your vaginal symptoms mrs shapiro
you better go to st stephen for tests they properly equipped to handle this sort of thing
he seemed uneasy
what sort of thing
not cancer
no gonorrhoea the doctor said apologetically
clare almost fainted from surprise and anxiety horror and shame
then she wept
the doctor refused to give her more sleeping tablets but scribbled a prescription for tranquillizers which were increasingly prescribed for women like clare with symptoms of anxiety in stressful situations such as poverty divorce or bereavement women with marital problems and women who were out of work also found them helpful although the pills did nothing to resolve the problem responsible for the initial anxiety
clare who blushed with shame whenever she thought about it waited anxiously for the result of her tests at st stephen hospital
the tests were negative
but within a month she could get through the day without tranquillizers she felt less anxious calmer
clare managed to open the red rocking horse by
at the opening party an excited josh rode the pretty antique red rocking horse in the shop window
monday august
standing by the swimming pool at saracen miranda beckoned to adam who was floating on the water in a transparent plastic armchair
in a voice of soft persuasion she said will you do something for me adam
i going to learn to fly
i want you to break the news gently to gran
but you promised your grandmother not to learn to fly adam objected
it was a condition of her gift to you the ten thousand pounds capital to start kits
i did say for ever
i pay the money back to her
miranda was defiant
i always wanted to fly
i wo be held by a promise that was unfairly extracted from me before i legally became an adult
and i get bored with nothing to do on holiday but lie in the sun
when are you starting
adam asked resigned
this morning at the cannes flying school
they have english instructors
four hours of instruction a day for two weeks
and of course this time of year it perfect flying weather
miranda was triumphant now
i already passed the two written exams
did law and meteorology last easter and now i finished navigation radiotelephony and technical that was the toughest
so that why you so pale
three hours later two thousand feet above the mediterranean miranda alert and exultant sat next to her instructor at the controls of a trainer plane an ugly little rallye which her instructor described as efficient and forgiving you could do something wrong m a rallye without getting immediately punished for it
flying was even better than she had hoped better than skiing better than driving a sports car
as the rallye droned towards the lighthouse on the tip of cap camerat miranda felt as if she were breathing the air of the gods
gently they swooped turned and climbed in the azure sky
after they reached two thousand feet the instructor showed her how to fly level he then encouraged her to experiment with the stick manoeuvring the plane m every direction
miranda felt that the aircraft was an extension of her arms and her fingertips outspread in flight
heading west on the return flight path the instructor said this is the first time i flown with a pupil and have once needed to touch the controls
miranda pushed home this advantage
then can i land
the instructor hesitated then said why not
the girl was clearly a natural flyer
after being given clearance to land miranda following her instructor directions started her approach she throttled back to reduce speed and control her descent as she flew towards the threshold the point just before she intended to touch down
the plane was now moving at not much above stalling speed
as the rallye dropped to about thirty feet above the runway miranda throttled back completely and held the stick back
the plane seemed to glide forward and land itself
the undemonstrative miranda flung her arms around the instructor
oh thank you
thank you
quite a smooth landing the instructor said approvingly he hesitated then warned next time be careful not to land too fast or you run out of runway
this woman was adventurous and ambitious such pilots did not live long
he added careful pilots are the ones that survive
a good pilot never takes a risk
the opposite of a good businessman miranda said still on a high
a businessman has to take risks constantly and win sixty per cent of the time
in the air that risk factor would kill you
nine hundred years earlier the great hall had been the hub of castle life wolfhounds ate on floors strewn with rushes servants slept on straw pallets thrown on the floor
then the winter salon did not smell of lilies and expensive leather but of stale fat stinking human bodies and animal ordure
elinor sometimes thought of all the love and the hatred the treachery and the killing that this hall had undoubtedly seen when strong men fought to the death to protect their women and children
now the winter salon at saracen where elinor waited for adam was not only the coolest but the most impressive room in the
high arched walls of pale stone were hung with tapestries around the big stone fireplace where logs burned in winter stood sofas covered in the blues and greens of the tapestries here and there were lamps flowers books and piles of parlour games
what keeping adam
elinor asked buzz who was adding up the scrabble score
you said three
it only buzz said
for you two hundred and for me
that not a bad score for you nell
buzz never cheated to let elinor win she knew that elinor would immediately sense this and feel humiliated
after an intensive rehabilitation programme of physiotherapy and speech therapy elinor appeared to have completely recovered from her stroke although she could no longer think of three things at once which buzz said was a mercy for the people who had to live with her
elinor was sometimes at a loss for the right word or name and then became impatient with herself she was often frustrated because she could move as swiftly as she did before
at times she was downhearted and wondered whether she would ever write another book
when you want to write you write buzz would tell her then
now buzz grunted look what i tore out of the daily mail
she dug into her pocket unfolded a bit of newspaper and read sportsman jim clark today opened a splendidly equipped physical training college at larkwood in wiltshire formerly the family home of the family
lady commented i wish them well
i doubt that
elinor peered at the photograph of the new owner a hero standing with her marjorie
the doorbell sounded
i go buzz said
it either adam or the postman
buzz returned reading a postcard
it for you from sonia rushleigh
whoops i mean bromley
who have thought them two would marry
she says the colonel taken up petit point and miss hawkins is teaching him
remember her the schoolmistress
i do indeed said elinor
frumpy sourpuss
who the letter from
clare
buzz held the envelope out to elinor
elinor shook her head
you open it
it marked personal
i do want to read it unless she apologizes
buzz opened the letter and read it
she shook her head
it just a friendly letter asking how you are
but reading between the lines i think clare needs money
if she took her poor child back to his father and gave her husband a second chance she would need money
how about a bit of generosity
buzz said
you a silly stubborn old woman
and clare just as stubborn and just as silly
it would have hurt her to say she was sorry
elinor looked anxious
do you really think she short of money buzz
i would want her to have a rough time
this remark was overheard by adam as in pale blue shirt and jeans he sauntered through the door
he said elinor you allowed ample provision in the trust for helping clare if the trustees consider that help is needed
i check on clare when i get back to london
he put a pile of papers on a side table
there rather a lot of paperwork here things that you should be aware of
we had more paperwork not less since the trust took over buzz said tartly
and i tell you frankly that i ca follow it adam
i thought the trustees were going to manage the business
elinor should be made to wade though pages of paragraphs with no commas in em
of course the trustees manage the business and they do it very well adam said
and there no reason for elinor to see any of this if it tires her
in fact i about to suggest something that would simplify matters
what that
buzz asked
i like to substitute paul littlejohn for myself in the power of attorney that i hold on your behalf elinor
i trying to reduce the number of business administrators the fewer there are the simpler the system and the cheaper it will be
does that mean that paul will be legally responsible for elinor affairs instead of you adam
yes but that only a technicality
paul will do as i say
and i also like you to sign this document adam added which absolves me and stg from any further responsibility once paul littlejohn has been substituted
buzz said but surely
smoothly adam explained the responsibility must clearly rest m only one area
it in your interests to clarify the situation
it customary
if you think that best adam dear
elinor frowned slightly at buzz
adam decided to hold back miranda bombshell until later after elinor drank her evening glass of champagne
just before five when the business session had ended and the afternoon was still hot quiet and heavy with languor buzz left to get some tea
adam escorted elinor to the elevator after taking her to her bedroom he intended to go to the beach for a swim
in the kitchen surrounded by the smells of mint and basil buzz whistled roses of picardy with much dramatic warbling as she prepared elinor tea
leaves and yellow blossoms obscured the top of the window while the bottom was covered by aggressive pink hollyhocks seemingly determined to fight their way inside
sylvie the cook sat at the big kitchen table by the window writing a list and shooing pigeons away
the bane of sylvie life was the pigeon droppings that littered the windowsill and had to be cleaned up daily
with a shudder sylvie refused a cup of tea
still whistling buzz laid the tray
the soporific calm of the drowsy afternoon was shattered by the bell indicator above the kitchen door
someone was jabbing the bell in elinor bedroom
knowing that adam was probably in the elevator on his way to the beach buzz hurled herself out of the kitchen and ran upstairs
frantically she tore open the door to elinor apartment
in the passage she stumbled and almost fell then flung back the door to the bedroom
to her relief elinor was not slumped on the floor deathly white she clung for support to the silver brocade hangings of her bed
wordlessly she pointed above the fireplace
buzz turned her head to the left where the portrait of the three sisters hung
at first buzz saw nothing but then she gasped in horror
each of the three long creamy necks had been cut horizontally a small triangle of canvas hung downward from each slashed throat

wednesday august
in the foyer of the clanrickard club mike grant leaned against the wall at the bottom of a curving staircase
with his hands in the pockets of his dinner jacket he surveyed the room
it was going to be a good night in spite of the fact that it was august and a wednesday
making sure to appear casual he carefully watched the men in dinner jackets and the women in dresses move slowly over the red carpet towards the restaurant at the rear or climb the staircase to the gaming rooms
mike noticed a group of heavy gamblers most of them greek move towards the baccarat room where the sultan of rupolei had been losing for the last hour
his attention was also caught by a woman dressed in satin and diamonds the sister of a ruler she was known as an audacious gambler
he stiffened as he recognized a man move upstairs with a distinctive boneless saunter he had better send someone up to check the backgammon room
the club owners the casinos and the multinational bookmakers knew which professional gamblers successfully played games that contained an element of skill such as backgammon and and they preferred to have nothing to do with them ideally the house welcomed inexperienced rich idiots
this is certainly a good night to play the odds
mike heard a sarcastic voice from behind him
he turned and smiled at adam
come into my office for a drink
what up
in mike office furnished with heavily varnished victorian club furniture
adam shook his head curtly at the offer of a chair
i not staying he said
i merely wanted to tell you that you scared the hell out of everyone at saracen except me
so kindly curb your theatrical james bond streak
i knew immediately what your message meant if you do pay up one slash is all it takes
he glared at his brother
i thought you were fond of elinor
i seem to recall that elinor helped you to buy your first good bike
why drag her into my problems
you might have given her another stroke
i do know what the hell you talking about and i ca comment until i do
mike his face alert and wary lit a cigarette
adam briefly described how the triple portrait had been slashed and added d you really expect me to believe that you had nothing to do with it
someone told some cat burglar where to find that picture
mike stared at his brother then slowly said not me
i agree it clearly a warning to pay but i swear i know nothing about it
it could have been the brothers they be even less subtle
he inhaled deeply
who else do you owe money adam you stupid bastard
no one who do anything so bloody childish
how do i stop this bloody nonsense
how many times must i tell you that if you let things go too far nobody can stop what will undoubtedly happen
adam mike went on quietly you always taken full advantage of anyone who fond of you
you think you can push me around because you been doing that since we were in the nursery
you also grew up watching grandfather clients literally get away with murder
he sucked on his cigarette furiously threw it into the fireplace shoved his hands in his pockets and glared at adam
do you want to be found washed up on the seashore with a few vital bits missing
are you so anxious to know what it feels like to have both eyeballs gouged out one at a time
do you want to be slowly battered to death before dying in agony
of course not you bastard adam said
i only want to know who slashed that picture if you did
whoever they are and only you know that these people are serious
punters often try to avoid paying
examples often have to be made
you know that
mike started to stride up and down the room
take that fucking urbane look off your face and face reality adam
if you lose money that tough
but if you do pay up that insanity
i had enough of your melodrama adam snarled
mike glared at his brother again
i not exaggerating
remember that incident when the sultan sister had her rolls stopped at two in the morning on the grande corniche after leaving the casino
they blew away the chauffeur head with a machine gun
she was touched
she paid all her gambling debts the very next day
and when the story was carefully leaked to the newspapers quite a lot of other debts were suddenly settled in full
i not some goddamned sultan sister
no but you also like playing with fire
you never believe that the gods will really let it burn you
you think you omnipotent but you are
keep your voice down adam growled
i do what i bloody well like in my own office mike said
do you understand
i on your side adam
you the only brother i have
his voice deepened
i probably more worried about this than you are
if anything happened to you
i be left without you
so for god sake pay up you stupid shit
do think you can get away with it just because you always got away with everything since you set that nursemaid apron alight
i thought you were too young to remember that adam said uneasily
he added she should have left the matches within reach of a child
she was in hospital for six weeks and i was the only one who knew it was an accident
i knew you wanted to see how far you could go
let not argue about something that happened over thirty years ago adam said finally
can you raise money to help me fend them off
i promise you
within six months i know i have no more money problems
never again
you have money problems as long as you gamble adam
annabel was determined to get a grip on herself and do as scott advised remember as the year she stopped having to go to auditions and as the year in which she blossomed into a successful young new york hostess as she met andy warhol lenny bernstein baby jane holzer and all the other fodder
by july annabel was a junior friend of the metropolitan museum a friend of the museum of modern art and a patron of the bronx zoo
she also allayed her insecurity with a massive spending spree each charity dinner required a new ballgown and each new glittering friend contacts for scott required a glittering party
so the year thus far was a busy one
the long road home
cia hq langley
sorge had never been to langley before
it was not something a russian expected to do
it was after when nowak drove him through the gates past the guards and into the vast underground
why langley
sorge had asked him on the way out of washington
they want to show you that they trust you
i do expect i see much
nowak laughed
damn right
we park in the underground catch a special lift to the fifth floor and walk across the corridor into a special conference room
that trust
that trust
the executive director was already in the meeting room
welcome to langley
he held his hand out in welcome
when the introductions were complete the exec director the dda the ddi sorge and nowak settled themselves round the small conference table
we have a new problem kicked off the exec director
the english operative who was guarding trimmler has taken off
he also taken an agent of ours with him
as hostage
a woman
we believe they still in new orleans
why asked sorge concerned
i do know yet
what about goodenache
he decided to turn the pressure on the russian
he caught a flight to frankfurt
he hired a car but the car was found abandoned on the outskirts of frankfurt
we are trying to find our missing scientist now
are the german authorities involved
no
we have our own means
sorge saw the exec director look up his eyebrows raised suddenly
we both have our methods
even in an independent germany
after all it was the death of our people in these situations that has brought us together
the exec director shrugged
bastard russians were still upto their old tricks
he ignored the pointed look the ddi was giving him
i thought it best if the director of our operations in new orleans gave you a run down of what has taken place up to now
he sat back and let the dda give a full report including the trip to the voodoo ceremony and all that followed
sorge did stir even when they mentioned the gruesome spectacle of trimmler arms folded in the sign of a swastika
we still are convinced that trimmler death has anything to do with the death of our agents
there no definite link
the situation might be clearer when i finished
sorge looked round the table saw their undisguised curiosity
in in germany we had a gru network named the rote kapelle
what that asked the exec director
red orchestra
the nazis called it that because we had radio operators we musicians
their leader the chef we called him was leopold trepper
it was this group that radioed the warning of operation blue the attack on stalingrad that led to hitler biggest wartime disaster on the russian front
who was feeding you all this information in germany asked the exec director
officials
both in the military and in the government
they saw the damage hitler was doing
they did disagree with his aims only his methods
when they saw that the war could not be won even as early as some of them opened up lines of communication with us and the british
we did get that sort of stuff till late into said the dda
you were europeans
we had centuries of contacts to fall back on
for all their bravery and resourcefulness their information was often wasted because stalin did believe them
but then he found it difficult to believe anyone
the germans with more sophisticated equipment started to track down the musicians
even trepper was captured and the rote kapelle was wound up at the end of
our information continued for a while but it was of doubtful origin
trepper was interrogated by the gestapo and we believed he became a double agent a lot of misinformation was received in moscow
sorge leant across and finished his coffee before continuing
but we still needed information
the overall network with sources inside germany was the rote drei
the red what said the exec director pleased that he had deciphered the first word of the new
three
the red three
based in switzerland and named after the three transmitters that they used
the most important source of information from agents inside germany was from a group under rudolf roessler
his was lucy and his network the lucy ring
roessler or lucy was a swiss intelligence officer of german extraction
he had many contacts in germany
lucy four main contacts were major general oster who was the head of the abwehr admiral canaris who was later hanged for his part in the bomb plot carl goehdeler who was leader of the official opposition to hitler and colonel boetzel the commanding officer of intelligence evaluation
there were others but lucy never disclosed any of them to us
even after the war asked the ddi
the lucy ring was disbanded in after being responsible for some invaluable work
i wo go through all their successes but it was substantial
the british were involved with them through us and it was their advanced work on breaking cyphers that enabled the ring to establish such a great record
but the ring disbanded once more because of stalin penchant for secrecy after moscow tried to bypass roessler and go direct to his number two
so where the link interrupted the dda impatient as ever
it important you understand the background said sorge not allowing the american to get under his skin
nothing further came from the ring until the last few weeks of the war
with the allies advancing on the eastern and western fronts many germans were out to save their own necks
the lucy ring was reactivated this time without the knowledge of the british
or the americans commented the exec director
i suggest you take that up with comrade stalin replied sorge drily
it was an impressive list
they did just have knowledge
they also had wealth
in all forms
art cash in every form possible
they used the ring because of their line into switzerland
they wanted the security of the swiss banks and the russian bear
one was dependent on the other
so they bought immunity
while our boys were still getting killed snapped the ddi
as were ours snapped back sorge
but your hands were that clean
you were bringing scientists and others into america just as we were
scientists with nazi records scientists with a history of brutality war criminals
gentlemen please said nowak ever the diplomat
can we just stick to what we here to discuss
go on dimitri
sorge was annoyed with himself irritated that he had allowed the intelligence man to get under his skin
of course he smiled back
now ah yes we used the lucy ring
many germans with their prizes crossed safely into switzerland
they came in cars army lorries even an aeroplane
their riches were stored in the banks under private accounts and then they were brought through czechoslovakia and east germany into the soviet union
all of them asked the dda
those who broke their word were hunted down
and disposed of
some needed reminding that we expected them to honour their word
it was a cold reminder of their world of the business they traded in daily
we had a large colony of nazis living in the soviet union
they were all scientists in fact we had little use for most of them
they had their own estates and farms to the west of moscow
they kept their secret identities and paid for it through their swiss bank accounts
but they remained germans always dreaming of going back to the fatherland one day
how many nazis did you take to russia after the war
the narodnyi kommissariat vnutrennikh del our people commissariat for internal affairs was responsible for
i never heard of them the dda stopped him
nkvd explained the ddi patronizingly
wiped out twenty million russians for stalin
that right he challenged sorge
more
thirty million
according to official sources sorge riposted
a most useful organization
that should shut them up
he felt the look of disbelief pass between the exec director and the dda
the other just watched him the mocking smile still on his lips
he would be the one rostov had warned him to be wary of
he decided to wipe the smile off his face
thirty thousand
that how many east germans we deported into the soviet union after the war
the ddi smile disappeared
thirty thousand nazis
jesus
yes
and we kept another hundred and twenty thousand between and in hitler old concentration camps
many were nazis but businessmen and professionals were also our targets
a third of those died
the others were eventually released and absorbed into the democratic republic
including nazi sympathizers
probably
does that concern you
sorge shrugged
not really
i was eight years old at the time
it was the answer that the ddi expected and sorge regretted his words
he was here to make jokes
the thirty thousand in the soviet union as i said became a community in their own right
without our knowledge over the years with the use of their money and supportive people in the swiss banks they forged contacts with those left behind in east germany
they all had one dream
to see a unified germany
to regain what they had lost
they had a amongst themselves
something that linked them was a reminder of how they had got there
it had to be a safe name innocuous nothing that would draw attention to the past
they remembered the lucy network their gateway out of germany
they called themselves die lucie geister
the lucy ghosts
yes
did the organization extend to america
the exec director was alarmed
how the hell did they
goodenache
i guess he was one of them asked the ddi
we were sure but in view of his sudden departure i would say yes
which ties trimmler in
and god knows who else
the name grob mitzer mean anything
he was one of their leaders
it was the lucy ghosts who supplied him with the cash that helped him build his empire
why did you stop it
damn it you knew about it for long enough snapped the exec director
we did realize how important it was
we thought they were like any other wartime group nothing more than reminiscences and marching songs
old men remembering their youth
the importance of it did surface until germany was reunified
and it was only the englishman overhearing the conversation between goodenache and trimmler that finally bridged the gap
so why should the english guy take off with the girl
the ddi changed the subject
he not one of us
i suggest you ask your allies about that
maybe he just an adventurer
no more
you must have cleared him
of course
the exec director did want his dirty washing wrung out in front of this russian
was there anything else
only that the gdr east germany as it was is different to the west
there are still many there who have forgotten the war
their attitude is different to us
some are still waiting for the war to end
they a traditional people
many even gestapo working and living normal everyday lives
working for the stasi
the ddi reminded them all of the secret police who had run east germany with an iron fist
some yes
others returned to the jobs they had before the war
within the new germany many of them have become frightened
their secrets are no longer safe
most of all they fear the israelis
is frick one of these guys asked the dda remembering the name picked up by adam in new orleans
no lied sorge
his orders were quite specific
do ratify any names
they did want the yanks stumbling in and screwing up in an attempt to force the issue
so what all this got to do with the deaths of our agents continued the dda
we not sure
except that a lot of the information we have both lost was about the lucy ghosts
link that with trimmler death goodenache sudden departure for germany and the mention of the lucy ghosts during their conversation and i think you will agree that is the strongest lead we have to follow
nobody spoke for a while then the exec director reopened the discussion
has moscow any suggestions as to how we should proceed
no replied sorge which was what he been told to say
we hoped you would come up with something
i sure we will
can you tell us the names of some of these lucy ghosts cut in the ddi
the ones in russia
how high up the ladder did they go
sorge enjoyed his reply
in time yes
but i can tell you you wasting your efforts looking for martin bormann in south america
he died twenty years ago
he watched their stunned faces across the room
well and truly shafted
they said little after that and sorge was soon being escorted with nowak down to the underground garage
five minutes later they were on their way back to washington
bormann
fucking bormann
they had him all the time said an astonished ddi
believe it
they probably got hitler stashed away too
well it been a real said the exec director
but let not forget we still got a crisis on
find the englishman
that our first priority
find him and see what the son of a bitch is upto
the amtrak crescent atlanta georgia
the train pulled out of atlanta station at four minutes behind schedule
they had slept well eaten well slept again and eventually got bored with the passing countryside
adam had insisted they stay in the room and she had found a good enough reason to change his mind
he was thumbing through usa today for the umpteenth time looking for something he might have missed when he heard her giggling
she was in the swivel chair reflected in the window with the dark night as a backdrop her head angled towards him
what so funny he asked pleasantly putting the paper down
you sure know how to give a girl a good time
do i he grinned back
according to all the books a secret agent life meant to be glamorous
we spent hours together and in that time i been bitten by bugs in a hooker bed tied up a guy with no legs and stolen his wheelchair stayed cooped up in a train for twelve hours with an attractive man and behaved like a virgin
do take that the wrong way
but james bond would handled it differently
he was scottish
i english
they prefer the ram and bang method
we more sophisticated in our approach
what happens next
in which department
in the department
to nordhausen
that where trimmler said he would meet goodenache
trimmler dead
and goodenache running from the russians
he ca go back there
from what i heard germany was still their home
and nordhausen was where they shared something special
they wanted to go there
if goodenache frightened and he wants to hide that as good a place as any
nordhausen
where is that
central germany
south of berlin near what was the old border
an industrial town
it was also where the nazis built most of their rockets the and during the second world war
from what i remember they moved most of the rocket manufacture down there so that our bombers could get to them
built the factory right in the heart of the mountains
used slave labour
i think a lot of people died in the making of those weapons before they ever got launched and blew up half of london
why would they want to go back there
who knows
maybe it was a job they never finished
but they did
those guys put people into space put our people on the moon
that enough for most people
that was just their work
and they did do it for germany
they did it for their conquerors
you telling me that all those scientists spent their time in america and could wait to get home
not all of them
most of them became good americans
and good russians i suppose
but these two wanted to go home
they never stopped being germans
maybe it the only thing they ever dreamt about
weird
is it
to want to go home
all they after is their youth
catching up with what they thought they lost
are we all
she shrugged and looked thoughtful
penny for them he said
i was uh just being a woman
tell me
thinking of peter
ah
the venerable ex
i know
here us heading for trouble and god knows what else and in the middle of you talking about nordhausen i start thinking of peter
wondering what the hell he upto
the emotional mind of a woman
stop knocking yourself
makes a change
i usually leave that to you
he burst out laughing
ok tough guy
what got you so tickled
here we are crammed in a small compartment in a train hurtling across america being chased by the cia the fbi and god knows who else and you worried about your sex life
christ he must been good
he was a shit
so why
adam stopped and shook his head
because some of us like shits
do ask me why
she laughed with him
he cheap too
he once bought me a louis vuitton handbag
your travel case reminded me of it when we left the hotel
it was for our second anniversary
i broke the lock and took it back to the shop in la jolla
they told me it was a fake
a fucking hong kong fake
can you believe that
what did he say
that he bought it in new york when he was there on a visit
and if he could remember where the shop was he go back and sue the bastards
that peter for you
a cheapskate liar and womanizer
and i ca let him go
that really pathetic news
is it
no
just human
very understanding
what would you know
maybe not women but my parents
and my twin brother
you a twin
was
they all died when i was nine
you said they were out of the country
that you had guardians
we all have things to hide
was he an identical twin
yes
that means you came from the same egg
that right
something like that
he in his usual stoical manner did tell her that he had studiously learnt everything about twins and their relationships
i had a boyfriend in high school
he was a twin and his brother played on the football team
if he got hurt my guy used to suffer too
we used to watch the game together and i suddenly see him wince in pain
just like that
and i look on the field and it was his brother who been tackled
yes
something like that
he laughed
i remember once getting a tap round the head from my dad
i done something wrong
i remember him saying it was a shame that he had to punish us both when only one of us was being naughty
that tap sorted us both out
do you still feel he with you
he is
then you lucky
you not alone
is that so bad
i do know why i alive and he dead
what his name
marcus
nice name
i glad you got someone to love
it important
ours is actually a new house
it was but er the market was so low that he decided not to well i do think he could get a buyer actually it just stood there so he he he let it out rather than have it stood there with the option for us to buy it but i say now the prices are lower he not keen on selling it at that price
and i not prepared to go on paying three thousand a year renting it to give to him when i could be buying one myself
yeah

erm and instead of the bath in the bathroom he just got a shower up there
probably is wardrobes there
i must admit i like a shower but then again i do like the chance to have a bath now and again
bath every every now and again yeah
yeah that bigger
erm which is why i went for the downstairs cos i had a choice of either
but i went for the downstairs one because of the bath
yeah yeah
yeah be nice

i mean we just been to look at some others and upstairs and downstairs
but the upstairs one in the other one was was
was bigger than the downstairs
hell of a lot of difference really it surprising just a
yeah
i mean i must admit i looked at some other flats
erm and one i looked at i could believe it
erm i mean it was a top floor flat
and so i mean you had to sort of go up several flights of stairs and you walked in and it it looked lovely
thought oh this is nice it erm it it had got a separate kitchen it was sort of like a kitchen diner
yeah
mm
but it was very big
a studio
mm
it was very big
i thought oh well this is lovely
walks into the bedroom well you would have hardly got the bed in there never mind about anything else
and er there was a hand basin in there and when you went into
in in the bedroom
in the bedroom
yeah
when you walked into the well what i would call a cupboard but they classed it as the bathroom
you got the toilet there and behind the door i mean you had to sort of squeeze yourself and shut the door and behind the door was a shower
you joking
no shower curtain mind you
even so no room to swing a cat

instead of a doddering old bugger like who miserable
well well he has got a father so he regards you does he
if you wan na take it that way
if if labour say get in
if labour get in and they ca fulfil their promises
yes
like john smith made promises then that conservatives have done this that and the other he must be able to do them now must he
who must
john smith
well erm they they do know whether they can do it or not do they
no but he criticizing the conservative policies and all that and what we will do is this
i know for investment
yes but they all say that
industry
do they until they get into power
i know
and and then they all
they do
back down
they do
yeah
they say they they probably have got the finances to back up what they what they said they would do
yeah but a a lot of quotes gon na be made to them after are there
you know like you said this and you have done it you said that and you have done it and all that sort of
yes but once they in power there nothing you
well
can do about it
oh admittedly no
no
but they must feel a bit stupid to er
well i ca well i mean there an awful lot i mean would no no matter which political party it is they all make promises but they do carry them all out
no
course not
but i mean these are these are major things
getting the economy right
now john smith
but er well john may have
we get the economy right
now if he does get the economy right he gon na end up with egg on his face and
of course he is
but you tell me how just how is he going to do it
i mean ee they do explain to you how they going to do it do they
no
they they just come out er
with statements
glibly with these these statements
mm
mm
i sure that if there is an easy way of doing it the conservatives would have found out and done it
i do think there any any easy way
i do see how they going to do it
no
i really do
i mean where are they going where are they going to get the extra money from er to pay for the old aged pensioners er eight pound rise
mm
or so they say we get eight pound
somebody got to pay for it
so it be the working people er probably the the national er health stamp have to go go up
it be a sorry day if they get in
it will gordon
oh
i do know
you a real turncoat you are
mm
are you
mm
i was listening today to erm a man on the radio and he was only thirty four and he had a stroke and they were saying he they er they were asking him they said well how did it happen
they said did you have any warning
and he said no
none at all he said
i was gardening and he said er er i bent over to do something and he said i just went dizzy he said and i fell over he said and then i realized my right side was paralysed
and he said i was completely confused and i could he said i was trying to shout my wife and erm and er you know my mouth would work he said but she said fortunately she looked through the window and er found him and they took him to hospital
and they were saying they were saying that you know you associate strokes with older people but there a hundred young people a week have strokes
tt
aye
and he said erm like it the clots to your brains that erm that cause it you know
they said well did you have any warning about it
and he said er no he said i did think i had he said but now he said i realized that how i was forgetting er i be talking and i forget sort of what i was just talking about that split second
mm
and now the stroke has affected him that way
he can be talking say about a well you know about any er about say a a video recorder or something like that
mm
and for a minute he can forget that he talking about it
mm
you know but erm he he recovered reasonably well in the same you know but
got his use
very
back
er partly back
partly back
not fully
you know
thirty four
i know
i mean you just do you do imagine that do you really
no
it terrible
but a hundred young people a week
i mean i i could believe it when they were saying that
that terrible
it is
it an awful thing
see i never i never across anyone that like know you
what do you mean
well i known anyone to be five years and no use whatsoever
ah well and i mean aunty lilly was like that gordon
she never got her use back and she never spoke again
yeah but she did well she did live long after her stroke did she
oh she did you know
er not as
mind she was in bed all the time
oh she was in bed all the time
yes
how long did she live after the stroke
only months were it
oh no
oh no
it was months gordon
no
i mean she was in park hospital for so long and then she was transferred to a nursing home in thornton
er do do you remember us taking iris and ian down to see her
i did see her did i
no we did go in but iris and ian did
did he
yes
well i i we i i drove them there
you was with me
yeah
yes
well i reckon she lived er a couple of years after the stroke gordon
i mean and she was in a terrible i mean she could even speak
no
i mean er erm and i went to see her in park hospital and she was very very frustrated because she could speak
no
what was she doing in park hospital
she took ill at aunty edith
well was it edith
yeah
i i think they been on holiday and she took ill on the holiday and and came erm she was stopping at erm edith and er it happened then
well you know i ca recall any of this
yes
did we we go to edith to see her then did we not
no but i went to park hospital to see her
because edith now edith was going away for some unknown reason i do know she must have been going on another holiday anyhow
no she was in park hospital a long time
that was it because edith was going on another holiday and she was er she wanted someone to go and visit er lilly and i said well i go
and i i it was when i had my own car and i drove there
and i wanted to see her
she was very very frustrated cos she could speak
mm
and she could write anything down
i do think you saw her actually
i do think i did
i never recall seeing her when she was ill
never
no
no
well you must have been going during the day while i was at work then
no it was night time i went cos i was working
well why in the bloody hell i did go then
why did i go with you
i do know
was it night school or something like that or what
i do know
i think you d ya know i think you were at night school gordon when i think about it
i think you were teaching at night school
it must have been something i was doing
no
i know why gordon
because the the children were small
one of us had to stay in
oh yes
aye that right
of course yes
you know i mean they were only small
aye that right
did we live in ashton lane then
erm no we were here
were we
yes
well i did have my own car in ashton lane
no you did
that right
so we was here
well about nineteen seventy then seventy one
no you got your licence in erm was it it were early in the year when you passed your test
yes i think it was
well it were seventy one
mm
cos did you phone me at lillycups to tell me
yes i think i did
yes
yes
well i was only at lillycups from august seventy till august seventy one
yes
only a year
and if you phoned me early in the year it must have been just after we got the v w
yes
i think it was
just a couple
so
of months after we got that
i think it was because er cos we got iris er er triumph did we
that right
yes
soon after that
yes
i think we did gordon
and you were driving that about
that right
that right
well carl had passed
and you went you went in that triumph did you to the
i did
yes
well it it was later than seventy one you see
mm
and you had that car about two years did you
oh yes
perhaps a bit longer
two years
yeah
because i came i came to er dellasel
yeah
when carl passed his er to m g s
yeah
do you remember
yeah
blimey
do you mean must be about twenty years ago then
yes
yeah about twenty
this is why you know i i think you should keep i keep diaries from years ago because i know you do like nostalgia and i do but it interesting
mm mm
to look up
yes
er events
yes
i mean i got no diaries dating back that long
no i know
well i have
i have no record of anything
no
happening then
no
but just one line of things that you know i do mean a diary where you write a page every night but just two lines you know
yeah
all and what you did and when i got the car the date and when you got that triumph then
yeah
you know little just a line
and then when you look at it er you can recall then
oh yes
other things
that right
the one line sort of sets it all off you can remember
that right
yeah
mm
yes but i remember i can remember edith phoning me and and saying you know she was going away you know is you know could i go down
and i said yes
mm
i cos i remember coming coming back i got lost
you know where er that circle is where there the shops well instead of taking i know instead of taking one road i took another and i got completely lost
mm
mm
i would now but then i i i did know er round that area
no that right really i mean if you do know the area you do know which road to take on the islands
i know
but i mean you would have thought that er lilly i mean she had no weight on her or anything like
no
that did she
no
she always been active all her life
all been active all her life
no you ca understand how these things happen
well they give you all these bloody tips and papers about what to do to avoid this and avoid that
and what to eat and everything but
this bloody footballer i mean it a
i know
a really fit man
i know
he er one artery was seventy percent blocked it was in the paper
yeah
and the other artery was ninety percent blocked
was it really
yeah
yeah
good god
i mean he could have gone any time
graham sounness i mean he only thirty eight
could have gone any time with with nothing through his bloody arteries
good god
but that i did know it was that bad
it was in the paper this morning
and er
goodness me
well he a he he did smoke
no
he was an athlete
he been an athlete
he obviously ate like everybody else
mm
and he
i mean
was overweight in any way
was overweight what more
no
the bloody hell do you have to do
that incredible that
see they say it was a it hereditary
well
cos his father had a bypass did he
oh did he
i think some other relative died er
oh
youngish
yes
oh well i bet i think perhaps it is really
i know
it still going
i know
yeah and you ca you ca understand it can you really
well look at the old lady that walks past here at ninety one
that right yeah
yeah
and she does all her own shopping
mm
you know i mean she keeps stopping but she she remarkable
she really is
mm
but they few and far between are they
when you like that
yeah
mm
but what i could understand with this this fella that
this sounness
aye
he he found out cos he went for to for a check up and they took his blood pressure
yes
and well lots of people go and have blood pressure taken they find it high and they
yes
give them tablets
yes
go home
why did they take it a stage further with him
he got high blood pressure he was in any pain he living a normal life
similar to what i was when i went
yes
and they just give me tablets
yes
now why what made them take it to the stage
well er well first
where he wanted a heart bypass
first and foremost he was in a private scheme
well probably that it then
yeah
and probably because because of his father and er the the other relative having the bypasses done
so they took it
mm
a step further but i think probably it because he was in er er a private scheme
very likely in n it
yes
so there a lot of people walking about with just taking bloody tablets who probably really should have a bypass
ah well i well i would say that really gordon
i mean i think er when your blood pressure was found out and you been taking tablets ever so i think it kept it all under control and you you we eat a sensible diet
the only the only er thing i complained about with you is is the butter
mm
i do have that much now
but i think everything in moderation but you do eat as much butter now as what you used to
i do eat that much bread you see
no
so i i think really and i think what i think with him i think definitely i think it must be the private scheme and plus that his own family it runs in the family
mm mm
must be hell of a shock being told
oh god
it must have been
see how much it costing
two hundred and fifty pounds a night
yeah
phworgh
that without the operation
yeah
well he earned three hundred and fifty thousand a year then
oh i know
and plus he he he he he married an heiress you know
did he
er him er they live in spain now
oh er he he worth a pretty penny is sounness
he went in carl shop the other the other week
did he
yes
mm
must have been looking for a house
carl said he he looked er well er his face did it were very he got a very poxy skin
has he
you mm
yes
he was having it done this afternoon were he
yeah
some time today
aye
i tell you what that quick int it though gordon
with only going in last night and
mm
having it done today
it is indeed
i wonder how quick they would have got him in though if he would have been in a private scheme
he could wait six months could he
well he could have been dead by then
well er yeah exactly that what they moaning about int it
terrible
put them on a list and wait
i never heard so much talk about health as we do nowadays
oh i know
when i was young i i do remember talking all the time about bloody health and what you should do and what you should do
no i know
did you
no
but we were educated in in in health though
we just we just lived and that was the end of it

half a case
and i sold four of those as well like
yeah
they carry out
and i sold three three double gin three you know

well that why they brought it
most probably take out and sell them what
yeah
left at the end of the night
i mean not all our customers are absolutely stupid
buy a bottle at five to two and leave it at two
it the nice ones that leave their drink there
mm
i amazed they have
well anyway i was talking to er rosette tonight cos i went to the office for some change and i then i had this like
she said i hear the empire or or hear the garden doing well on a friday night
must have heard about that from alan
he goes it too fucking dead
well it it last day of week
where
popping up to christies and just after you go up the top
no no no where
where are you talking about
the empire
but apparently they doing quite well on a wednesday with the students
students yeah i know
and erm mark was in last week he said
they getting six hundred like
well mark said it was mark er guessed about four hundred
he he he went in last week he went in this week and er
well paul paul said to me six hundred about seven hundred
yeah
normally he said he said well there would be about six hundred
nigel mentioned he told me it was erm er like four five hundred in tt to
not bad though is it
well it very good in n it
i mean on a wednesday
and it only a quid to get in and it a pound pound a pint
two quid and and a drink yeah
but on the other hand they making a little bit at a pound a pint
well they making five or six hundred they bound
to be getting on with it
that right
that getting in the
i do think they got a lot of staff on
i would have thought they bother with a
no
student night having a lot of staff on it pointless having ah i mean the bouncers in that situation
well you only need one
but we do need a bouncer on
except mind you the the rough the erm rugby club gave the band a bit of er a rough seeing to
what band
he had some band that were awful apparently and the
whole of the rugby team were lying in front of stage with their
they they never left they were playing the rugby club
fingers up
no no no no no
no
university
university rugby club
oh
the uni
yeah
mhm
yeah
the band went ran off in tears apparently
could cope
seeing the university rugby club i would i would have eh
mm
must be some narky bastards in the rugby club
oh
i ca get it out it stuck on his collar i hope she comes back for it next week
but six hundred on a wednesday night that pretty good
mm
does the sugar house get that many people in
no
no
the sugar house only opens er thursday friday saturday
or or we always have done
i mean we we opened originally first year every night of the bloody week and it was pointless absolutely pointless
is that bigger than the empire
i never been in it
yeah
no
er yeah
yes it is
is it
it legal it legal
well it on it on a thursday yeah
it it legally bigger than the empire but the empire can get more people in cos he got upstairs and
yeah
that
mm
see
but of course erm for licensing they do take that particularly into consideration up there
well they half upstairs straight away
yeah
yeah
so er
i mean i think i i think the empire legally is well i thought it was nine hundred
seven fifty i think
i ca think er i do know
i think it nine hundred
i mean you could you could
well i thought it was seven fifty
certainly get seventeen eighteen hundred in there
well yeah
even that bob monkhouse opened up quite
yeah
quite nice
yeah
well they have the garden wo they
oh yeah
mind you
probably fucking tell by cos there was i thought
they
there was too many
yeah
but i mean they were banging they were banging fifteen hundred in for that disco for the first
mm
few months were they
no twelve twelve or thirteen
they never had fifteen
did they
i mean the sugar house his capacity
just been upped to eleven hundred i think
erm i mean it was always nine hundred but it been upped to eleven hundred last year i think
well we used to put i mean i put twelve thirteen hundred in the sugar house
but but you it full at that you know
mm
whereas the the the you you could you could you could fit sixteen seventeen hundred
no i reckon there was they reckon between a a thousand and eleven hundred for a night you know
but you could fucking move at that
yeah but it was a it was also a it was a bit of a celebrity i mean it was people people were crushed around bloody hell i mean
yeah that right
yeah
all the downstairs i mean all the plebs were upstairs all the downstairs was erm
yeah but maybe maybe a hundred people
mm
i sure
i mean i do know i you see i left i had to come here so i left before bob monkhouse and everything i just i all i did was go for couple of free drinks and plate of free food which i do think i got
and left
you get a few fucking with the chef
you know deep sea diving at
yes you would
you you betrayed us then you left had you
you left me
i had to leave
you fled us
and gone to work for the opposition
were you well i did reckon you were opposition
but i did go out or something
just cos you thought you were
it funny though
just cos you you were coming out with about two hundred and fifty quid a week for working seven nights a week
no i originally they they were open seven nights a week
i know
no
was it four times a week
and you were secured were you secured there
mm
oh
seven nights a week two hundred and fifty in my pocket guaranteed
going to bed with jean fucking fucking shite
kelly
christ
some of the schemes they come up with
get your blood going
i mean i i i be interesting to see how they they start next week with a a load of er bands on thursday nights
mm
i mean they all chartsey stuff but
mm
you know i i that kind of stuff does draw punters generally chart stuff cos the people who go
i du n no i think the young
the people who are interested
i think the young people go to it like
well yeah maybe
maybe some of that will
yeah
but generally pop poppy type
a lot a lot of
top of the pops stuff does in the sense that people who like to go and see live music do people who like that kind of music prefer the prefer it in a
yeah
disco context
yeah
yeah
not not seeing sort of a live concert
anyway
in fact in fact most of the stuff they do like anyway

it was it was on the regional news it was peculiar
well we did
it was on the six well it was on all day one two three
yeah the
four six
normal news
nine yeah
it was on the regional news
where were they
salford keys
he was up seeing all the north west candidates parliamentary candidates
jean was in that horrible mustard and black striped
contraption
stuck out like a sore
so that everybody noticed
yeah
her dressing up outfit
hear labour are one point five i heard it yesterday
yeah
all the
i thought she was going to be meeting him next weekend then
all the dirty tricks start now though
at the regional conference at blackpool
erm
i do i do i do whether he going to that
forgotten what it called
yeah it i know it north
yeah
west er no regional councils labour council the urban councils or something like that
something like that yeah
no well i do know he might be
i do know whether he going to that he might be but this was this he was up sort of seeing meeting all the labour party candidates for the north west
well if i had a million invested have it all invested
yep
yep
i agree
seriously i fucking have it out of there everything i own
but he all the dirty tricks are starting now
kinnock a funny he really is
he er the sunday times tomorrow
er i remember you said about
full sunday times tomorrow major expose on the the the labour leaderships ties with a moscow moscow company
did you see it
yeah
oh you mean they still getting moscow

oh
er sunday times
personal view of the files on
typically
dennis healey fuck
he gon na out with some stick
kinnock was saying to erm the candidates you know we i realize that a lot of you are getting it rough at the moment cos there about five labour
yeah

yeah
west mysteriously
but er jean not a
yeah
derek there somebody derek
derby
derby that right
blackpool under investigation

photographing who comes in
they been to his little boy primary school interviewed the teachers and headmistress and all the school friends and everything just trying to get a dirty story
the two companies concerned are trying to record the spoken word
we do want you on tape
so the thing the thing to do is to sort of dot around in the conversation things like antidisestablishmentarianism
and hopefully
this will get modern usage of words
of one of the words that she was talking about people have started using wicked for a normal phrase
i mean it does mean what it says in the dictionary any more
that a really wicked thing to say he went no it not it bad it not wicked
he thinks of wicked as being good he does cause mandy says wicked
yeah

right o k now we can go now we can go home
four add four and then
four add four equals eight
two times four equals eight right
yeah like that
and then two
and two times four is eight
erm i did write it like that then
right
share the total of fives
yeah i done yeah i done
er
five five five is fifteen
five add five add five
erm is fifteen
and then erm
right
is fifteen
and then
and sixes
sixes six

add six add six
add six
add six
is thirty six
right
six times six is thirty
i done that one
sixes
that it
okay
erm this
i leave that out
leave that out
add them up
mm
that much closer can use those pictures
take a look
are they near the box
yeah
is that right
four
four is twenty
so it four so
four times five is
twenty
four times five equal twenty
er two times six equals twelve
er four times three equal twelve
er two additions left
alright
those two add
so it like one two one two and one there and but put like erm seven add seven add seven is
is twenty one
yeah
seven add seven add seven is twenty one
one
and three times seven
right
is twenty one and do it that way five and fives
okay
two addition questions
hang on
two yeah but you got right two multiple and two addition equations
not equations
you told us this
but like these these are equations
so two addition equations er three times seven plus seven plus seven is twenty one
right
oh
so but you can also go
yeah
yeah add three
three plus three plus three plus three plus three plus three is twenty one
do it that way on
do you follow
yeah
me
yes i do
right
two multiplication
yeah
and two addition
two addition
right
so you like you
yes that right
then it like erm
one
seven times three and three times seven
and three times seven
that right
and you do the same there
same on the adds
and then this we do like
right she wants currency in two divisions in each right
so it one two three four
that multiplication is a
yeah well divisions okay so it twenty one shared by say if that one two three four five six int it
oh i know what i got
six times three is eighteen or three times six is eighteen
i know what i done
i put the i thought it was er okay
six
and division is shared by
so you got to do eighteen shared by six is three and eighteen
have you got
shared by three is six
so like you go one two three four five six six times you swap
three
six times three
times three is eighteen
is three times six
six
yeah and and you got
six times three and three times six
and division is eighteen shared by three is six and eighteen shared by six is three
yeah
got it
i can not read
three sixes are eighteen
you got it
and you do the same there
hang on
i have finished thirty three
one yet
that what i do get
why do multiplication equation for this similar line i do get how you do that
is it would you like us to put
it fours int it
it fours
no two four six eight ten twelve
yeah
it
that twos
no but it going to fours look
it going to fours
alright
going into fours
what would i put
er one four is four two fours are eight and three fours is twelve
as this is been shared by lines int it
yeah and it on that one
you do it like that do you
yeah cos it being shared by
oh
so it i would say that is er nine times four equals thirty six
and on that one is er sixty three shared by nine six time sixty three divided by nine
four
no
sixty three divided by nine is six
write six through it
ten six in n it
no it ten sixes
no no wait a minute
nines
what should nine times ten emma
one nine is nine two nines are eighteen three nines are
twenty seven
four nines are thirty six five nines are forty five six nines fifty four seven nine are sixty three
oh thank you
right
yeah seven nines are sixty three
hang on a minute
six nines are
seven nines are sixty three
hang on a minute
seven
seven nines are sixty three
sixty three
yeah
you work them out like that look
yeah
well seven nines well ee er it takes you so long
look one one nine is nine
yeah
two nines are eighteen
so that one there is sixes into thirty six
i know
but i still do get what you have to write
well multiplication equation for this number line i would say is er i already told you that
no but i do know what i have to i have to write
eight times four equals thirty six
do get it
because it one two three four five six seven eight no sorry nine times four is thirty six
nine times four equals thirty six
like this look
write it out on a piece of paper and you and i write them down
no
you do it yourself
i told you what to do
you do it like that
i do get it though
i tell you if it right
i just writing the answers out for you
i told you what to do
that lazy
int it
you crafty cow
if i give you a bit of paper and the lot yeah well you know what to do and go to school and fill them in

and a man came back and
oh
and went back
pardon
skinlid
the skin
well he called skinlid
is he
i do know
i did watch it that closely
have some more tea
ate it all up
mhm
so if it a puppet show did rosie and jim do some puppeting puppet
no
they were in the audience shouting and cheering from what i saw
where they
mhm
then they went round the back though did they
did they
mm
they run round the back and played with the puppets
when the show was ended
nobody mentioned that they were puppets themselves
that what i call a miracle
i do that
i do think they like it
mm
it was nice to see stratford
i wonder if that they filmed that at the time when the boat was in stratford
do you remember when we went to
yeah
yeah
we nearly went to see it but we missed
yeah
cos it had moved by the time we got there
so it might be then they might have taped it
mm
it could well have been
but mum it a bit late from that
well it always takes a long time
they they do these things months beforehand
and then it comes on the television later on
how to get to know about these things
mm
this chap we were sitting next to involved in all these canal projects
oh yes that right
he was
apparently he a director of various canal preservation bodies and things
oh
he was certainly into canals in a big way
yeah
yeah he is
mm
you have to get to know is he in your
no he at solihull
oh solihull
what was he called
jonathan
jonathan
he was a pleasant chap i thought
oh yes
as these chaps go
it was interesting discussing various chaps after
oh right
only just sort of see them occasionally to get the inside stories to
have drunk
mm
how julia
she was okay this week
well she a totally snowed under
well it not
with work
surprising
like i had to give her some top priorities yesterday as she was going to be about
actually she did very well on one of those
she did far better
did you tell her

cos he was desperate for cos he needed an answer for monday morning for dave

it might be or it might not
mum is the video on

why
i not quite sure what happens you see
that why
i just pressed but cos there a little line
hear the sound of the video
when
well i can hear it now
oh
yeah i wondering whether it playing to itself with the television off
do you think that likely
or does it not do it
no cos it not got the aerial it would do
it would do
would it
oh dear
it not got the aerial in
no
should
it is it on it on the video
it just that i can actually hear it
i can actually hear the motor on

something weird is happening there
i know that
mummy wash up
this thing is it on off
has it been on
it not been on no i just switched it on
right toast and marmite times two
i think everything on this erm machine is to do with food do you
probably is
you need to sort of stop and talk when you have food
yes
yes please cup of tea are making it then good
i did manage to sort out the food for tomorrow and
did you really
that very clever
well i thought
did you manage to do alright
yeah
found
i mean pinched one of for starters that makes a difference
did you try it did you
no
ah ho
a pathetic film on i do
ah
know what it was about but it was pathetic
ah
mm
what happening tomorrow
what do you mean what happening tomorrow
well what is it tomorrow morning and evening and things
what
what is it tomorrow morning and evening and what are we going to do in the afternoon without

i know we cope but what are you going to do
are we inviting anyone
i know we not inviting anybody for lunch christmas day could cope with that but it would be quite to have them in the afternoon ca cope with the people
oh yeah
suppose we should do something yeah
well that what i was thinking perhaps we could go with somebody somewhere
you know like by a canal or something
perhaps well if it snowing it wo be quite the same
that right
conducive to tripping about
but if it quite nice weather it would be nice to invite somebody along i expect
they could just
stratford
yeah the stratford warriors running about every six weeks something like that
is it six weeks since we saw the last one then
they did they they have them more frequently now and they getting even more and more infrequent now for the rest of the year
mm
and next one
that mother day twenty second
is it
no
mother day a fortnight
twenty ninth
somebody will organize a party for tuesday
yeah they want a party piece on tuesday
it alright you do have to of cake
if i do bake them now my mother
yeah well tell your mother
i have to
yeah i will
get one
and it better be a nice one
pop into marks and spencers they have some amazing shapes in marks and spencers that the children will enjoy
really
mind you it might be expensive
tesco are probably cheaper
you remember that tom and jerry i got for tim
because i could be bothered to cook it
well leave it up to me i see what i can get i get for the party
thank you dear
is that alright
yeah
i get you some
and i just make the rest of the with salad in
you not supposed to
i told you what we gon na for christopher have i
i know he went to school to do
yeah
housework
is that naughty
thursday morning
right christopher will be back too
i wish i could i like to
you what
out at the meeting again on monday night
on monday
where are you going monday
going to sue house
oh right the big housewife
the housewife mhm
like cooking this week
ah i having jane for a piano lesson are i
what day
which day
monday
are you
oh well
so that fits in quite well i could remember what i was doing on monday but we said sort of tentatively monday would be probably quite a good day i think
better than thursday anyway
so could tuesday night be inspector morse night
yeah cos my mum will be here then
oh right can we not take her home
unpaid
well she
we shall see
have been here all day wo she
so she might want to go home
she wants to tell us all about her wedding
could you tell her we going to watch inspector morse
for the third or fourth time
will she have watched inspector morse
she wo of watched it cos it bound to be on a wednesday night
does she like inspector morse
i do think she watches it normally
no she probably does like it
a bit spicy
i bet she would she loves anything like that
bit of a body
mind you it might be too complicated
it was i remember reading in the paper that it been it been filmed at a house which no one ever been allowed to go in even the great sort of one of these country mansions it was not
right
and even people who write about
if it was not it ca be again they always going in there
well that fine
it was some country mansion in oxfordshire you know
mm
it as you come off the
and how did
and
they get permission then
they somehow managed to persuade the owners apparently it was and it was and nobody else had ever been allowed in this place not even erm historians who write about famous buildings even they had been refused access
where is it
somewhere in oxfordshire
oh
they do know where
oh
so
this was about last week episode
i think it was about last week but they seem to imply that it was last week episode that would
oh
do it
we seem to have got one spare video if we do get it watched before wednesday
alright
well that the only chance
oh yeah cos we going to maryland tomorrow
your dad
mm
erm not it was about your dad it was about my birthday cos
cos
he realized that it was my birthday and what did i want
so i said send me a cheque and i go and shop
and
and last week cos she quite generous is she
she is a bit but it
no i did say anything
i think that the thing
so your dad sent a cheque
anyway i asked her if she heard from your dad and she has heard from your dad apparently on friday he went to the consultant
mm
and next week he got his first well she did know whether it was radiotherapy or chemotherapy
and she said he has to go trotting to exeter two or three times a week now
mm
i do know how long it going to go on for or what it is exactly but i thought it would be a good idea to ring your dad up and see
mm
but at least things have moved and at least they gone round
so i pleased really are you
interesting that they done it so quickly is it
after seeing him because he thought that once he seen the consultant it would then take some time to get the treatment started but they must have got themselves over that
yeah
well i mean everyone
yeah
i think
got ta get moving
and presumably whatever it was the gp had give him has had upset that thrombosis again
i do know whether to ring him tonight oh it too late tonight now
it much too late
perhaps we could ring tomorrow afternoon when the children are up
well they love talking to them on the phone do they
i know they do
we could can prime them up on what to say and types of things to talk about so they do get moaned down or something
bogged down
so he had to go in what did you say
three times a week
i do know she just said
something like that
a few times a week and i think it sounded like three cos she was wondering how he would cope with driving and everything
mm a trial
well i hope not i mean no he wo be able to drive
but presumably your mum can do that for they got hundreds of people there he always driving people everywhere
that right
so i do see why they ca drive him
i sure they will
yes
cos they very good are they
i mean look at that woman doing her er from the from the church
at times like this it would be nice if we lived nearer could help out
it would nice if we lived there but we ca so
it about
and write as well
yes
double dose
yes
and pulled out
well it sort of pulled out but at least it
we be paying for it as well
and it hard as well
we been paying anyway so it must of you know
what does erm you see er eileen and she having chemotherapy is she
by by medication is
that right
well she takes all these tablet things
that right she has a sort of massive dose every now and then
and that makes her feel what
she not in pain is she
more sort of dopey
i would care if they made me dazed
yeah

yeah
i du n no
not gon na
difficult to know
oh yes that was it
i wonder how bad it is that feeling like we do really know how bad it is do we
no
perhaps he will be able to say you know
but whether he tell us over the telephone you think ask
i think he would would he
i think so
cos we got the agm in two weeks time
mm
and we voted all these people that are here
what type of this
well you just
it does matter
you just come along do you find out
what we do with all the money and you find out who doing what and who doing you know
mm
it it quite exciting really
if you
but i
these little things
you could show me something
alright
you see cos it
we confusing her now cos
this is where we going not towcester alright
this page

oh right yeah well i was so worn out
what have you got
that the pages are always sticky with sellotape and so on
actually it must be quite interesting looking at the development of language as time goes on
mm well that that all that for
it be interesting in the year two thousand and ninety to look back and see what we used to do in the nineteen nineties
i should think i be dead just then
i do think i be around then
well you wo
somehow
be around but it be fascinating cos you be recorded for life june
that it
and i
sorry i going to speak to dot i was just going to speak to dot and i
oh

come to tell you
alright
how many little do you have
it varies considerably you can have eight you can up to fourteen except fifteen why how many do you want in
no it alright cos someone rung up from home say be in eight so she wants to do something
right
she said ooh you know can i invite a couple of friends can i invite sort of you know people back to lunch but when it sort of the list i mean cos i i not
invite
well i got to know cos sort of adult as well i mean you included as i mean it to put
getting a bit long
yes

it more cosy
and at home
if she wants her sister

erm
i know that but will you make it stick
yes oh well
can you be a path finder leader on the sunday because
no
no you know what i mean
but if you can you know agree to tell him
and the
but i find them and you wo have any bother
oh i know but i mean sort of there i do know she would actually when it comes to it but if we see her up there cos we can do the
it nice to see erm michael and sophie
yeah
actually it quite a cosy group so they probably know each other by
yeah
now then
yeah
looks a bit agitated
but anyway
that somebody that would would be a few
telling everyone about her mum and dad when they and erm how she talked to her mum about that and it helped her
but her mum i mean i know
cos i mean i know her mum
she
well vaguely but
are they moving to to be with someone else or
i do know i mean i do
but perhaps he does want to change till cos she
yeah but she
so whether they think well so it after six months
well
i du n no
is that alright
they were they were really nice
i hate being sick and one thing another well it turned out
yeah you do
yeah
sophie was supposed to be doing the chorus so i grabbed mary and said come with me on the half way through called sophie why are you doing all the talking dot and not mary
cos she
cos she supposed to be andy
oh
so sarah had a job to do but it was sort of till the end and we gon na finish too quickly because normally we have it like paul and helen being really with it and look there sort of upward
oh no
and then down below there helen you know christopher and
yeah
then laura with him
but none of them turned up to today so
actually can you really face the from the other pathfinders
mm cos she see you there
cos we having not problems but at school it really it unfortunate because she was put in a third year and she only a third year now and she was on a third year class last year
who else is there with her in there
they all
well we actually chose the brownies now her age
yeah
yeah
but it really hit her this year we felt quite disgruntled
yeah
that i really but i mean last year still not finished
she really funny
so we had a laugh well said he when he woke up he said day one you can do three on one day
mind you she like that better get
when you feeling keen i said you can do a lot and then
they rather weed i know my two even
erm rather than

you know or patrick into psalms she loves poetry
psalms i thought
why not
i used to do it oh what psalm is it she
i forgotten about being in mud was it a
she did it
yeah
but as they do it gon na hit her cos it not year that it does help see if she in a third year class she was always as she is now in the top of that but even
that right
when she was only a second year therefore that means she not given enough work but i mean
i know what you mean
she sort of got with children then because this erm testing they got to a school work outside
curriculum
they that it they do have to take them on to

the next
i mean
yeah well she sort of with the third year and will admit she so fed up
but i i
oh yeah

i mean i glad she er september and an august birthday i would of hated to have gone
