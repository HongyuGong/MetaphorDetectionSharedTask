the labour party conference : policy review throw a spanner in the whitehall machinery
by colin hughes , political correspondent
an incoming labour government would turn large area of whitehall upside down — but the party 's policy review barely considers the implication of it plan for restructuring government department .
scattered through the policy review are proposal to : drastically alter the status and organisation of the department of trade and industry ; create two department — a department of consumer affair , and a department for legal administration ; create a department of environmental protection within the existing department of the environment ; set up a plethora of new commission and executive agency ; set up a woman 's ministry .
those are only the most overt change advocated in the review paper .
the only department which explicitly escape unscathed is the one which conservative would most like to abolish : the department of energy .
in virtually every case the aim of causing upheaval is explicitly declared , because labour 's aim would be to upset the bureaucratic order it inherits .
new department and quango would , according to the review , be designed to act a irritant and antagonist within the civil service system .
but the policy review nowhere considers the overall effect of the individual change proposed , or how they might be co-ordinated .
nor doe it contemplate the knock-on consequence for labour minister of attempting to implement their programme while rebuilding the governmental machine .
the ‘ medium term industrial strategy ’ which would form the centrepiece of labour 's economic policy would , according to the productive and competitive economy review group , be ‘ administered by a transformed department of trade and industry ’ .
the review add : ‘ what we now seek is a dti which will have an equal , if not superior status , to that of the treasury . ’
that approach would seek to knock out a keystone of civil service tradition .
labour policy ha long sought to challenge the treasury 's dominance in government .
but it last effort — the department of economic affair , set up by harold wilson and headed by george brown — ended in futile departmental and ministerial infighting .
there would in addition be a minister for science and technology at the newly supreme dti , with responsibility for determing investment in research .
there is no mention in the education policy of how that might affect the department of education and science .
but while the dti would override the treasury , a new ‘ powerful department of consumer affair ’ would antagonise the dti .
it would be headed by ‘ a minister of cabinet rank ’ and act a ‘ the consumer ’ voice with other government department ' .
it remit for inter-departmental intrusion would be wide , with ‘ a watching brief over government action ’ and the ability to initiate consumer legislation .
only the woman 's ministry would be given equal license .
it would be able to ‘ require each government department to review it policy , practice , and existing and proposed legislation ’ .
while new department are born and others extended , one of the oldest — the home office — would become a shadow of it present self .
labour 's proposed department for legal administration would take over responsibility for court and tribunal ; court procedure ; organisation , training and appointment of the legal profession , magistracy and judiciary ; legal aid ; legal service ; and the sentencing council .
that would leave the home office with policing , penal policy and the criminal law .
responsibility for the sex discrimination act , the equal pay act and the equal opportunity commission would be given to the woman 's ministry .
the concept of a minister having cabinet rank — and therefore implicitly not being a member of the cabinet proper — crop up again on environment .
a ‘ new minister of environmental protection ’ would operate inside the doe .
that could work — though it is easy to imagine conflict of interest with the housing and planning function of the department .
more problematic will be labour 's plan for the ministry of agriculture , fishery and food .
‘ the priority of maff must become food , not farming , ’ the policy review say .
‘ it main concern would become food and the people who consume it , not farming and those who produce it . ’
but the regulatory function over the food industry , now split between maff and the department of health , would transfer to a new food standard agency .
that is the first of many agency , executive , commission , and other quango-like body recommended by the review .
in some case labour 's quango merge existing one , or replace well-established body .
the funding of higher education would become the responsibility of one body , rather than two .
labour 's quality commission would replace the audit commission .
but there would be new regulatory commission and consumer council for every utility , along with ombudsman , and public interest commissioner appointed by the secretary of state .
there would be skill uk — a locally structured training commission — a fair wage commission , a health technology commission , a health quality commission , an education standard council , an independent sentencing council , a child 's commissioner , an environmental protection executive , and a social insurance fund administered by … ‘ an independent commission ’ .
an atmosphere poisoned by mistrust
by nicholas roe
the disposal of toxic waste is one of the most intractable problem facing industrialised society .
even though some of the most dangerous and persistent toxin , including polychlorinated biphenyls , pcbs , are no longer manufactured , quantity of them still exist , and must be got rid of .
but how ?
and where ?
on this page , nick roe visit a plant which , despite strenuous public relation effort , ha failed to convince it neighbour that it ha come clean .
and richard north look at current provision for the destruction of pcbs , and at the history of british involvement in a rather uncomfortable growth industry the security guard at the entrance to one of britain 's mightiest hazardous waste disposal plant pressed a button and the gate opened .
then he pressed another knob and a big toy doll in his office window dropped it trouser .
you had to laugh .
yet this wa rechem international 's high-temperature incineration plant at pontypool in gwent , south wale .
hardly a laughing matter , surely ?
beyond the barrier lay some of the most toxic chemical known , awaiting destruction by fire .
what else ?
a vast , smoke-blackened furnace ; 100 people to do the work ; massive investment — the company spent £2m last year on cleaning up smoke emission .
plus a backdrop of house covering the valley wall on either side , a reminder that wherever industrialised society decide to deal with their most intractable problem , they are unlikely to find a place to do so which is not in somebody 's back yard .
britain grind out almost five million tonne of hazardous waste each year , of which about 63,000 tonne are so difficult to store or treat that they are burnt at high temperature here in gwent or at one of three other centre : ellesmere port ; fawley , near southampton ; and the unfortunately named killamarsh , near sheffield .
five more incinerator currently proposed in various part of the country will double capacity .
then there are the import : 83,000 tonne of toxic waste enter british port annually for incineration or other treatment , a figure which ha increased 20-fold in just eight year .
in these environmentally conscious time , this is an uncomfortable growth industry .
liverpool docker recently turned back part of a 1,500-tonne consignment of canadian pcbs ( polychlorinated biphenyls ) bound for this plant in gwent .
in doing so , they underlined a fact which is likely to attract more and more attention a tanker continue to shift toxin from town to town , country to country : the waste chain is long .
it snake in and out of port , along our busiest highway and through our most crowded city .
anxiety which are currently felt most acutely by those living near destruction plant themselves may not always remain so localised .
at pontypool , the collision between a precise , scientific industry and a diffuse , unscientific local suspicion is painfully apparent .
local people mutter and march , make speech and throw thing ; staff face sarcasm in nearby pub ; and for year there have been demand for a public inquiry .
rechem ha responded with a rather desperate open-door policy aimed at soothing fear , and more recently by issuing about a dozen writ against the fiercest critic .
‘ we are an aggressive company , ’ admitted david wheeler , operation director at this plant and at rechem 's other incinerator , at fawley .
for a place so hated , the pontypool plant look innocuous inside , like a cross between an oil refinery and a crematorium .
mr wheeler , an engineer who worked for many year in the oil business , is a pleasant , slightly worried-looking man who can not bear the fact that no one seems to realise just what length he go to in order to keep the plant squeaky clean and emission-free .
in hard hat and protective glass , we walked past the huge ‘ fume cupboard ’ where the most noxious barrel are opened , and arrived at the vast , closed mouth of the furnace itself .
it wa hot , but not burning .
there wa a fault on the computer governing the plant , said mr wheeler , and the fire had automatically shut down .
these pipe stretching thinly in a bridge across the service road injected a mix of chemical into the wall of the furnace itself ; did i know that fuel wa only used in the start-up process , after which the chemical themselves provided the fire ?
worker in blue overall drifted around u and cracked joke in gentle welsh accent .
in the furnace control office i found shift foreman keith thomas and asked innocently if he had any physical problem : ‘ not since my vasectomy . ’
a grin .
he lived locally , so how did neighbour view his job here ?
‘ you get sarcasm mainly .
a lot of my friend are pleased that the company is doing the job they are doing .
others are not so well informed .
you could n't hope to convert them . ’
at a nearby house , leonard hough , a retired schoolmaster , had earlier told me about ‘ the fog ’ which he say come from the factory .
‘ it blow along the valley .
they 've improved the chimney recently and it 's very much better than it wa but we still get the smell .
and since they 've refused repeatedly to have a public inquiry into what is going on there we 're not certain of the safety of what 's coming out .
we get smoke from the steel work across the valley , but we know what that is and we 're not afraid of it . ’
keith thomas pressed a button and a huge door clanked upwards so that i could peer into the heart of the furnace .
pile of ruddy-brown ash lay heaped on the floor .
pump sucked air inwards .
heat shone out .
in here , they burn about 30,000 tonne of chemical a year , a quarter originating outside britain .
the waste arrives at the rate of up to seven tanker-loads every day — that is seven lorry passing thousand of doorstep .
right here , in this gaping mouth , lie the end of the chain .
the waste include lindane , ddt , out-of-date drug , carcinogenic chemical , old cigar and even pornography ( a different kind of pollution ) .
about 7,000 tonne of the total waste is pcb-contaminated .
pcbs are so difficult to destroy , that rechem 's emission-monitoring system are geared to detecting them on the ground that if you destroy pcbs you destroy everything .
this , of course , is a key point .
if you did not burn chemical like pcbs , what else would you do with them ?
the sea ?
the earth ?
‘ we are not in the business of polluting the environment , ’ mr wheeler insisted .
‘ we are on the side of the angel . ’
environmental organisation , however , put the emphasis elsewhere .
‘ there is no incinerator which completely destroys toxic waste , ’ madeleine cobbing , greenpeace 's toxics campaigner , told me .
‘ the crux of our argument is that we do n't need to have toxic waste and the fact that plant like rechem exist , providing easy option for company , is acting a a disincentive for company to clean up . ’
but — another but — what about the pcbs that already exist ?
although they are no longer manufactured , they are still present , for example in electrical equipment .
no one could therefore call for the closure of incineration plant at a stroke , because noxious chemical have to go somewhere .
so a part of the argument switch to the kind of incinerator you allow while industry is forced to clean itself up .
also , how these should function and — perhaps most important of all — where you put them .
mr wheeler , now moving to the rear of the plant to show off the £2m smoke-cleaning section , which had just broken down , pointed out that his company achieved destruction of at least 99.9999 per cent of all material .
the company 's figure imply that when you have burnt 99.9999 per cent of a 30,000-tonne annual throughput , a figure of 0.03 of a tonne remains .
in 1986 , according to friend of the earth , a survey of the home clustered on the surrounding hill found that three-quarters of 800 resident were opposed to the rechem plant .
‘ the plant should be relocated because it 's in the wrong place , ’ llew smith , the local euro-mp , told me .
‘ it is in a valley and in a highly populated area . ’
what did mr wheeler make of that ?
‘ if we do it properly any spot is the right spot , ’ he insisted .
stack emission of pcbs were below the american standard for breathing air - 1,000 time lower than the british equivalent .
regular soil and grass test showed no difference between pcb contamination in the immediate area and elsewhere in wale — though there are no established ‘ safe ’ level for these .
five air-monitoring plant had been installed ( he took me to see them ) .
and here were drum of chemical , each labelled , each with a job number to check against sampling .
and yet there are accident .
in 1987 , aluminium melted in the furnace , reacted with water and exploded , sending a black cloud over nearby house .
later , drum supposedly containing carcinogenic drug were not opened for checking before burning ( for health reason ) and three were ‘ misdescribed ’ .
they , too , reacted with water , and a plant operator wa burned by a cloud of acid gas .
we walked past a tanker where a huge man named andy matthew wa pumping vinyl acetate into a 10,000-gallon vat , wreathed in it sweet , sickly smell : ‘ i 've been here two year , ’ he said .
‘ my father wa an industrial chemist and he said if you want to go and work for them , go and work for them . ’
were there any spillage ?
he shrugged .
‘ nothing major .
i might drop a pipe — a little bit of a splash . ’
in a large , prefabricated shed we wandered past stack of 45-gallon drum of pcbs , two drum high , about 10 deep ; and there were contaminated transformer waiting to be cut up and roasted in the flame .
back along the waste chain , the liverpool docker who objected to the import of exactly this type of chemical should be aware that pcbs are moving about our road all the time .
there wa no difference between the liquid in these drum and the liquid in the cargo they refused to touch .
in liverpool , a docker ' spokesman with the transport and general worker union admitted : ‘ driver are n't happy handling some of these commodity , but at least a lorry-driver ha more idea of what he is handling than a docker , who could have a consignment and just not know what it is . ’
yet he did not oppose all toxic waste movement ( after all , the same union represents worker at rechem itself ) ; he simply did n't like the idea that big industrial nation like canada could dump their dirty problem on this country and his member .
driving away , i noticed that the vast chimney wa still not functioning , but when i called at a neighbouring house a woman showed me video she had taken of smoke coming from the plant , settling in her garden .
certainly the incinerator seems well controlled .
certainly there is no scientific evidence that living nearby increase the risk of sickness .
certainly , mr wheeler convinced me that his company wa going to huge length to keep itself clean .
‘ we must run it safely in the short term and long term , ’ he said , ‘ because if people are able to demonstrate that we are causing an environment problem we will be shut down . ’
in april 1985 a tanker spilled 200 litre of pcbs over the main trans-canada highway on the border between ontario and manitoba .
a section of the road wa shut for a week and motorist were warned to clean their car and to dispose of the rag in plastic bag .
law : always take along a friend to sue : litigation can pay off even in the unlikeliest circumstance .
stephen gold explains
by stephen gold
when thing go wrong you can sue more often than you may think .
money may not have changed hand .
someone may have even done you a favour .
it doe n't matter .
a long a you can show that they owed you a legal duty to be careful and have been negligent , damage could come your way .
there are a number of point to bear in mind .
take up reference before giving credit , lending money , letting in tenant , taking on staff .
ask bank , building society , former landlord , present and past employer .
if you rely to your detriment on a misleading reference which wa given negligently , you should be able to sue the referee .
the subject of a bad reference can sue the referee for libel but ha to show the referee wa upto no good : spite , ill-will or some improper motive will do .
take along a prosperous adviser on all shopping spree , demonstrate a high degree of trust and strong reliance in what they say and you may have unexpected protection should the seller go out of business and the good fall to piece .
a 26-year-old woman accountant who knew nothing about the mechanical side of vehicle asked her more knowledgeable friend to find a car for her .
she stipulated that it must never have been involved in an accident .
the friend found one at a garage .
although he failed to check it had been accident-free , he assured the lady that this wa the case .
she bought it .
it had been in an accident and it wa worthless .
in may last year the court of appeal upheld a judgment against the friend for more than £5,500 damage for negligence because he had owed the accountant a duty of care .
your conservatory collapse a a result of negligence of the professional who were engaged by the previous owner to put it up .
you can sue the professional — builder , architect , surveyor or engineer — by courtesy of the defective premise act 1972 , despite the fact that you never had a contract with them yourself .
there are strict time limit : generally , six year from when damage first occurred ; where the damage wa initially ‘ latent ’ you are given longer — three year from when you could have discovered it , with a longstop of 15 year .
it may also be possible to claim damage against a local authority for negligently failing to ensure that construction work complied with the relevant building regulation .
a solicitor fails to draw up a will within a reasonable time for a client who subsequently dy .
you lose the gift which the will would have made .
you can sue the solicitor for what you would have collected , had he done his job properly , because the law reckons he owed you , a well a his client , a duty of care .
when you want to borrow on a mortgage , the prospective lender will have the property valued at your expense .
there is no contract between you and the valuer .
but if the valuer is negligent and you buy the property relying on his report , you may still be able to sue him for damage .
this is what the house of lord decided in two case last april in spite of an attempt to get the valuer off the hook by a disclaimer which said : ‘ i accept that the valuer doe not warrant anything stated in his report a being accurate …
‘ ala , disclaimer may work if , for example , the property being valued is industrial or an expensive house .
disclaimer may also be used by referee and others to rob you of a claim for damage .
whoever attempt to hide behind a disclaimer must prove it is fair and reasonable to do so .
but a disclaimer can never take away your right under the defective premise act 1972 for the collapsing conservatory or prevent anyone being sued for negligence which ha caused death or injury .
have we yet reached the point at which we would be awarded damage against the meteorological office because we went camping on the day of an unforecast hurricane ?
or after we followed the duff advice of a legal journalist in a newspaper ?
mercifully , we doubt it !
book review / the cause without a rebel : ‘ the pale companion ’ — andrew motion : viking , 11.95 pound
by martin pacey
it wa unfair of auden to suggest , in his ‘ letter to lord byron ’ , that a poet 's ‘ sense of other people 's very hazy ’ .
but the vaporous presence that float through this slender and anaemic first novel by a notable poet would appear to support the claim .
the book — which open a projected sequence of novel that will cover the period from 1968 to the present day — aim to explore what the blurb describes a ‘ the painful transition from youth to adulthood ’ .
this , of course , is a popular subject : it seems particularly attractive to the poet-turned-novelist because of the scope it offer for the tremulously sensitive probing of feeling .
sensitivity , though , is not enough .
what andrew motion present u with here is a static and humourless mood-piece filled with over-elaborate imagery .
the hero , francis mayne , is suffering from the adolescent 's emotional confusion and acute self-consciousness .
he find it hard to communicate with people , not least his separated parent .
his father is a faceless figure : a retired brigadier , reserved and taciturn .
his mother , by contrast , is the most vividly realised character in the book : nervy , flirtatious and selfish , already on her third husband , she think primarily of her appearance , even when visiting her dying daughter , francis 's twin .
the first half of the novel is dominated by the girl 's death from leukaemia .
there is a refreshing simplicity and tenderness in motion 's account of the way francis nurse her , but she herself is too sketchily drawn for the episode to carry much weight .
meanwhile , at his public school , francis is conducting a love-affair with an older pupil named keith ogilvie .
he is finally rejected by the devious , arrogant keith , who informs him that he is ‘ obsolete ’ because he doe not ‘ know how to make thing happen ’ .
his response to this rejection is a flat a his reaction to the massive demonstration which keith ha earlier persuaded him to join against the vietnam war .
this violent event , described at length in hysterically colourful term , is the only piece of history to be woven convincingly into the plot .
other broad hint a to the date are inserted with a comical lack of subtlety : ‘ my god , darling , have you heard ? ’ exclaims francis 's mother one day a she greets him , ‘ czechoslovakia .
it 's been invaded . ’
motion will have to do better than this if he seriously intends his series of novel to capture the feel of a period .
but the book 's principal defect remains the vacuity of it protagonist .
in his eagerness to depict the cloudy psychology of an adolescent , motion ha forgotten to give the boy a personality .
he ha , however , given him a psychotic compulsion to formulate fanciful simile .
hardly a page go by without the hapless francis noticing something which reminds him , improbably , of something else .
sometimes he is reminded of several thing .
one moment an avenue of chestnut tree look ‘ like a child 's drawing of ghost ’ ; the next it appears ‘ frightening but derelict , like extinguished chandelier ’ ; and finally the chestnut ‘ prance at him , holding up their gleaming branch like hysteric . ’
such writing rapidly pall , and i hope that in the novel to come , motion can curb his reckless passion for it .

secateurs are likely to be the tool most in demand now .
the summer 's sprawl begin to be oppressive at this stage in the year and trigger finger are itching to snip back overgrown mallow , clear out the mildewing foliage of golden rod and reduce the overpowering bulk of bullyboy ground cover .

buddleia , although messy , should not be cut back until spring .
dead , ragged head of the climbing hydrangea can be removed , cutting where the stem join the main branch .
virginia creeper need to be clipped back from window and hauled out of gutter .
mulching is a pleasant activity for october .
it can be done in spring too , but there are usually more pressing job then .
shrub such a hydrangea particularly relish rich ration .
it is a good time to plant hardy shrub too .
clematis so bristle with brittle green shoot in spring that planting then is an anxiety rather than a pleasure .
runner bean and french bean have now given up completely and can be cleared off vegetable plot .
globe artichoke are sprouting new leaf and may need protection from frost in cold area .
summer bedding is looking tired and should be removed so that the ground can be cleaned and fed ready for spring bulb or wallflower .
design : crossed line over the toytown tram : city transport could soon be back on the right track , say jonathan glancey
by jonathan glancey
modern tram , a most continental european know , neither shake nor rattle , nor do they roll .
sleek , solidly built , gentle on the environment , they are often an ideal form of city transport .
they also exert a fascination very much of their own a they slither round circus and brush through old city gate , flashing arc of lightning a they switch track on winter night .
single-car , articulated or double-decker , tram are one of the most reliable and enduring form of public transport invented .
the orange-liveried ‘ 1500 ’ series tram in milan , for example , date from 1927 .
eventually they will be replaced , but more than 60 year on they run with the rhythmic reliability of a swiss watch .
they are a much a part of milan a la scala or the galleria vittore emmanuele .
last month it wa announced that britain will get it first new-wave tram in 1991 .
destined to run in manchester , they will relieve traffic congestion and help to reduce the level of carbon monoxide in the city centre , outlying suburb and satellite town of bury , altrincham , salford , oldham and rochdale .
in britain , with the main exception of blackpool ( not forgetting the single-deckers of the isle of man and llandudno ) , tram had been largely relegated to the history book .
otherwise , the best place to see working tram ha been the tram museum at crich in derbyshire or else in old british transport commission film and ealing comedy .
tram disappeared from most british city in the 1950s .
london 's venerable red and cream double-decker rumbled along the thames embankment for the last time in 1952 .
somehow the image of the tall , thin , mournful double-deck tram with it wooden body , slatted wooden seat and growling electric motor ha stuck in the british mind .
tram , it wa believed until surprisingly recently , are old-fashioned .
they had something to do with fish and chip wrapped in newspaper , men in hat , national health spec , smog and powdered egg .
they held up the bright new diesel bus and , even worse , blocked the progress of private motorist in bulbous austin and lumpen humber in canyon-like city thoroughfare .
they picked up power from a spider 's web of unsightly overhead wire .
they were inflexible in operation , draughty , and mobile reminder of tb epidemic with the enamelled ‘ do not spit ’ sign screwed to their bulkhead .
but the modern tram could hardly be more different .
it play a key role in keeping city street on the move and is even the object of the best modern designer ' desire .
in milan , for example , the commission to design the new generation of ‘ jumbo ’ tram , which went into service in 1979 , wa one that leading italian architect and designer fought over .
after all , the jumbo , a handsome and imposing articulated unit designed by architect , engineer and critic klaus giovanni koenig , will be seen on the street of milan for the next half-century .
spotlessly clean and popular , the jumbo is a long-term advertisement for koenig 's design skill .
the modern tram is a green machine .
assuming the power station at the end of the line burn cleanly , the tram is virtually pollution free .
standing at traffic light a koenig-designed jumbo is , save for the chatter inside , completely silent .
the overhead wire are so slight that you have to look hard to see them .
power of acceleration and braking are remarkable , the latter far greater than any car .
but sadly , there is no indication that the gma consortium which will design , operate and maintain the first of the new generation british tram in manchester will share the look of their milanese counterpart .
artist ' impression show a tram that ha more in common with the flat-faced , characterless light train of the toy-like docklands light railway .
there is still time for gma ( gec , mowlem , amec and greater manchester bus ) to consider employing an inspired architect or industrial designer .
after all , mancunian and visitor to the manchester conurbation are going to have to look at these mechanical millipede for well into the twenty-first century .
now that bus are no longer designed to enhance the street they serve , manchester ha a chance to make a fresh start with it tram .
manchester is not alone .
other british town , croydon and southampton among them , are also considering modern tramway .
these are all referred to a ‘ supertram ’ network , the implication being that the new-generation tram is an altogether more dynamic form of transport than it pre-war predecessor .
what it really mean is that the new tram are a hybrid between street car and lightweight suburban train .
although they will slip through the city centre serving the essential part — shopping mall , leisure centre , theme park , amusement arcade and museum — the manchester supertrams will also head out of town on a mix of reserved track and existing railway line .
the supertram is , in effect , a low-cost replacement for british rail 's ageing fleet of suburban diesel multiple-unit train , those rasping diesel which change gear to the accompaniment of voluminous cloud of acrid black exhaust fume and the blessing of train spotter .
they will perform some of the same function , but they will not be an exact replacement for traditional tram .
and although the supertram concept will spread through major city during the next decade , blackpool will still be alone in it use of traditional double-decker .
musical / bow of holly : mark steyn review london 's latest musical biography , buddy , at the victoria palace
by mark steyn
the texan drawl ‘ y'all ’ , black go ‘ yo ’ , hispanic leer ‘ hey , ameeeeeeeego ! ’ .
and towering above these stage cliche is , of course , the driven genius whose music can not be stemmed by the force of reaction .
who is it this time ?
wagner , glenn miller , jason donovan ?
no matter ; only the accent change — and the pant : here , the square wear slack , the good guy blue-jeans .
warned not to sing rock'n'roll on a c&w station , buddy holly insists , ‘ i got ta play ma music . ’
misunderstood by decca record , he maintains , ‘ i wan na play ma music ma way . ’
even when the hit start , he 's not content .
‘ we got ta take our music more serious , ’ he tell the cricket , who remain unconvinced .
‘ you got money , you got fame , ’ he pleads , ‘ what you want to booze for ? ’
booze ?
we 're midway through act ii and a solitary six-pack ha yet to hove into view .
but this is a plot development — the plot development — and , if it involves turning a couple of aled jones type into oliver reed , why let logic get in the way ?
a it happens , there is a kind of logic behind buddy .
the most common reason for a biomusical is opportunism : take a star like judy garland or john lennon , and you pick up a hit title and a hit score ready-made .
now , alan janes 's play match the well-loved song with equally well-loved dialogue in a k-tel golden great collection of dramatist ' reliables .
choke up at the price of fame : ‘ i give ‘ em everything and they stick a knife in my back . ’
fight back those tear at the inevitable parting : ‘ you and me , boy , i reckon we 've come to the end of our road . ’
marvel at the little woman behind the man : ‘ i 'd like to sing a song fer a special girlfriend who 's kinda important to me . ’
the justification for this is authenticity .
‘ all that happens in the play is based on fact , ’ janes pledge solemnly in the programme note .
‘ a we know , truth is often stranger than fiction . ’
often ?
most of u prefer to watch dallas than our neighbour ' home-movies , because , when it come down to it , we know that truth is generally a lot duller than fiction .
occasionally , though , a dramatist will uncover someone with an interesting story , regardless of how unknown or vaguely remembered the subject is .
how many of u can now recall the real maria von trapp or fanny brice ?
they live only through the sound of music and funny girl .
buddy holly come somewhere between the subject of those and more parasitic biography .
his record are still played , but his personality , unexposed through movie or extensive tv interview , is almost entirely unknown .
it is , in theory , the best of both world — except that buddy holly , by all account , wa not terribly interesting .
he wa born in lubbock , married a nice spanish girl and died young in a ‘ plane crash in 1959 .
all that count are the record , a rhythmically unusual tex-mex fusion of rock'n'roll and older western element , pioneering what became the standard pop instrumentation of two guitar , bass and drum .
the lyric are another matter .
of the two prototype rock songwriter , it 's the more worldly chuck berry you turn to for the authentic picture of teenage pleasure in eisenhower 's america : ‘ gon na write a little letter , gon na mail it to my local deejay . ’
or : ‘ cruising and playing the radio with no particular place to go . ’
berry 's song are plausible emblem of rock'n'roll rebellion or , at any rate , youthful hedonism .
buddy invite u to regard holly in the same light , mocking ( in a horribly nudging re-creation ) lubbock old-timer like the hayriders , who sing : ‘ when the sun go down on blue ridge mountain it 's the time to whistle in your ear . ’
at least , this ha a surreal daftness .
the voice of rock'n'roll , in contrast , is almost unrelievedly soupy .
if you did n't know the tune , you 'd assume holly 's lyric decorated some innocent backporch spooners from the turn-of-the-century : ‘ star appear and the shadow are fallin' you can hear my honey callin' . ’
or : ‘ you give me all your lovin' and your turtle-dovin' . ’
or : ‘ when cupid shot his dart he shot it at your heart . ’
not only are these song impossible to use dramatically , they 're also too vague to use a incidental music , to underline or punctuate aspect of holly 's life or the 1950s more generally .
‘ i wrote it for you , ’ he assures his gal before the ballad , but how can you tell ?
all you can do with these song is sing them , and buddy fails even to manage that with any subtlety .
the finale to both act are effectively concert , the sort of agreeably naff rock'n'roll revival that might just about pas muster a a capital gold one-nighter down the hammersmith palais .
and , for all the appeal of his singing and playing , paul hipp come out pretty dull between the number .
to camouflage the failure of the play , andy walmsley ha created a set which resembles a pile-up of roadside hoarding : oldsmobile , van heusen shirt , texaco premium type .
rob bettinson , the director , ha deduced that he ought to have these image plus disc-jockeys , radio commercial , midwestern hop , but he doe n't seem to know why .
like most show which are manufactured with an eye to commercial success ( winnie , high society , to name only buddy 's predecessor at the victoria palace ) , this one will probably fail .
it 's not a if there are n't aspect of his career that are n't worth exploring : how did he come to use drum , then almost unknown in texan country line-ups ?
wa it true , a the chart performance of ‘ heartbeat ’ ( his last release ) suggests , that his three-year career wa already on the wane ?
and surely any dramatist ought to be able to move u with that final night of holly 's life , when his musician ( including waylon jennings ) gave their place on the ‘ plane to the big bopper and ritchie valens .
the author 's job is not merely to offer an illustrated who 's who entry , but to turn element of a man 's life into a dramatic entity .
and , if holly 's too boring for that , perhaps the best approach would be to write about his impact on others .
that , after all , is what don mclean did so brilliantly in ‘ american pie ’ , a personal reaction to ‘ the day the music died ’ .

canberra may seem an awful long way from exchange on the floor of the house of common over the european monetary system .
but were it not for the perceived economic might of a more unified economic community , the dozen or so nation of the pacific rim , who have been meeting in australia , might not have bothered .
the first , albeit tenative , step towards forming a new pacific-based economic union display an astute awareness of the way event are moving within europe : movement with which number 10 ha yet to come to grip .
not so long ago it seemed a if the world wa to divide into three main trading block : the ec based around the west german economy ; a northern american block based around the us-canadian free trade area , and a pacific unit incorporating the asian tiger with japan and the yen at the centre .
but the metternich-like skill of the u secretary of state , mr james baker , are ensuring that america maintains a strong stake in each forum .
it firstly boldly asked for a seat at the top table at the european community : a suggestion rudely rebuffed .
the u ha talked of a genuine north american free trade zone incorporating the u , canada and mexico which would have the best of all world with high-technology skill and a cheap labour force south of the rio grande .
now it is making a third bid for influence .
it ha turned up in canberra with japan to develop asia pacific economic co-operation ( apec ) and a new 12-nation organisation which will mimic the role of the organisation for economic co-operation and development in europe .
preliminary step taken to conduct study on trade , technology and investment flow in the region may seem insignificant .
but mr baker plainly view it a otherwise .
he noted that the canberra meeting ‘ is the start of something which could grow into a very significant development not only for the region but for the global economy . ’
if the more economically puny asean country ( indonesia , malaysia , singapore , brunei , thailand and the philippine ) were to bury their reservation , then the high growth from other partner , including such tiger a thailand and south korea alongside the more mature economy of japan and australia , could mean a dynamic coalition .
it would then be up to the u and canada to decide whether they want to face towards the atlantic or pacific — or be caught between two great trading ocean .
heading for default .
the question of just who would even want to be a partner with the u wa underlined last night a the american administration headed for default for the first time in it history .
congress wa frantically trying to complete a bill raising the federal debt ceiling in time for president bush to sign today .
leader on capitol hill virtually put all other business on hold a it sought to hammer out a debt ceiling increase .
the treasury secretary nicholas brady , a level headed figure , warned that the imbroglio may lead to higher interest cost for the taxpayer .
what should have been a routine exercise in extending the government 's borrowing power to $3.1 thousand billion became bogged down in wrangling over legislative initiative lawmaker wanted to attach to the bill .
a a result of the stalemate , the treasury ha been forced to postpone $40billion in debt auction this week .
lack of congressional action also forced the treasury to suspend new sale of u saving bond and of special security for state and local government .
this market sensitive dispute ha taken place a president bush and congress continued to spar on a primary cause for government borrowing — the budget deficit .
at a press conference to mark his election victory a year ago , mr bush threatened to veto the budget unless it contained real cut .
otherwise congress would have to face the consequence of automatic across-the-board cut under the gramm-rudman-hollings budget deficit reduction law .
america may have changed president a year ago , but the fiscal thicket remains a inpenetrable a ever .
political expediency .
no longer can the government disguise the crisis surrounding electricity privatisation .
minister have already had to pull britain 's fleet of magnox reactor out of the float and delay the sell-off date by up to six month .
but it ha now become clear that further drastic amendment are needed to flotation plan .
after month of turning deaf ear to warning by the city and industry , the department of energy ha at last conceded that nuclear plant can not be included in the share float without state support .
this leaf the energy secretary , mr john wakeham , with two option : he can either agree to underwrite any cost escalation in nuclear handling cost after privatisation , or he can swallow his pride , and pull all nuclear plant out of the impending sale .
whatever the outcome , the government 's willingness to continue pushing through the float during this parliament show how minister are prepared to put political expediency before the interest of the industry .
for the nuclear element in electricity privatisation is the coping stone on which the flotation plan are based .
national power wa given 70 per cent of the cegb 's generating capacity in order to give it an economic mix of power .
the other 30 per cent is to be operated by powergen , the other cegb successor company .
take away or subsidise all nuclear power station and you lose the commercial logic of the privatisation plan .
electricity privatisation need to go back to the drawing board .
at the very least , the cegb should be divided into a wider range of generating company to stimulate competition .
is it worth sacrificing the long-term future of britain 's biggest stateowned industry to make political capital in the run-up to the next election ?
22comment the guardianwednesday november 8 1989 more than just another disaster .
thirty five people died and others were maimed for life in the clapham rail disaster in december last year because work wa done in a slovenly , haphazard way and wa then left unchecked .
the disaster wa all the more stunning because people had come to assume that such thing did n't happen .
in most year , rail death are few : in some there are none at all .
clapham , indeed , account for nearly half the 77 fatality of the last ten year : compare that with the 5,000 death and 300,000 injury every year on the road .
yet yesterday 's report on the clapham crash , confirming the picture which emerged throughout the hidden inquiry , make an event which seemed at the time totally unexpected look almost inevitable .
this wa a system hopelessly under strain .
under strain for a start because it wa technically ill-equipped to avert disaster or to cope with the consequence when disaster struck ; under strain from commercial pressure which , a the inquiry put it , ‘ compromised ’ safety ; under strain above all because the people on the spot could n't or would n't cope , were weary from gruesome working hour ( the senior signal technician who head the list of the culpable had had only one day off in the past 13 week ) , lacked adequate training , or simply could n't be bothered .
the bulk of the blame for all that is placed on british rail , which knowingly permitted these thing to continue .
though individual are nailed , the greatest villain of all is the system .
in a desperately competitive climate , where anyone bright and competent could go down the road and pick up a better paid job with kinder hour and more congenial working condition from someone like british telecom , the railway ran a service dependent on people who belonged to a narrow and inbred working culture , with outdated procedure of training and promotion , and an institutional reliance on overtime working , whose wholly disgraceful dimension are symbolised by the fact that maximum weekly hour were only recently cut to 72 hour a week .
the transport secretary , mr cecil parkinson , assured the common yesterday that financial consideration would not stand in the way of implementing sir anthony hidden 's 93 recommendation .
on the technical side , remedial work is in many case already on the way .
but the job of lifting the standard of people employed , giving them proper training , and paying a wage which break dependence on overtime and lift morale : this together must far exceed the cost of the technology , and it is n't by any mean clear what the bill will be or where the money will come from .
all of which is not just a problem for a properly penitent british rail : it 's a problem for government too .
government fix the format in which br ha to work ; and if , a the hidden report attests , many of it problem today reflect lack of past planning , lack of farsighted investment , living from hand to mouth , then that is not just br 's doing .
government compound all these problem when it set down working parameter which fail to reflect the value the country get from a system that is run efficiently , can shift people to destination with exemplary speed and safety — a europe consistently demonstrates .
it is sad , and somewhat ominous , that so little of that should have been reflected in the sombre statement which mr parkinson made in the house yesterday ..
a service in chaos .
the nation 's ambulance service wa in manifest chaos yesterday .
there wa no service in london , with all 71 station and 455 vehicle off the road .
the only accident and emergency relief wa provided by the police , part-time st john ambulance volunteer running 20 vehicle , and the red cross .
outside the capital , accident and emergency service were being provided in most area , but the ban on emergency work wa tightened .
the service wa facing it biggest crisis since the ambulance came to a stop in the winter of discontent ten year ago .
like labour in 1979 , the conservative have put military ambulance on standby .
they move in today .
what ha gone wrong ?
there are three key cause of the shamble : mr kenneth clarke ; the failure to separate emergency from non-emergency work ; and the whitley council negotiating machinery .
the health secretary accused the union of ‘ posturing and pretending ’ to run a 999 service yesterday .
he wa right .
by refusing to keep open two-way radio link , the crew had effectively ended a proper emergency service .
the move wa signalled last week and , true to their promised response , management suspended the worker involved in the disruption .
but ‘ posturing and pretending ’ went far beyond the union .
mr clarke ha been indulging in just that himself , putting up the luckless duncan nichol , chief executive of the health service , to take the initial flak under the pretence that the dispute is not his direct responsibility .
yet it wa mr clarke , not mr nichol , who wa involved in the critical decision — the cash limit for the nh , the 6.5 per cent offer to ambulance worker ( compared to seven per cent for nurse , eight per cent for doctor and nine per cent for ancillary worker ) ; and today 's introduction of military ambulance .
ambulance worker on emergency work do deserve a much higher increase .
they have progressed far beyond routine first aid .
their paramedical skill cover highly technical procedure : intubation , infusion and defebrillation .
the crew are able to resuscitate heart attack patient , replace fluid intraveneously after severe blood loss , and insert tube to maintain air supply in unconconscious casualty .
yet the ambulance worker is only being offered £10,000 , when a fire officer is being given £13,000 and a metropolitan police constable can earn £25,000 .
but only two million out of the 20 million journey which ambulance crew carry out each year are emergency call .
nine out of 10 are routine call , many of which could be carried out by mini cab .
mr duncan nichol want to separate the emergency from the non-emergency work .
he is right to pursue this line .
wiltshire and northumbria have already shown how much can be achieved .
the ramshackle whitley council negotiating machinery is the other reason why the ambulance worker have lost out .
until this year , the three independent review body which make recommendation for nurse , doctor and the profession allied to medicine have given much higher award than the whitley council .
a lord mccarthy noted some 13 year ago , the management side of the council comprise ‘ employer who do not pay and paymaster who do not employ . ’
a much more flexible system which would allow local manager to negotiate local rate — on a national pay spine — is needed .
a crisis ; an agenda for reform and honesty .
one mr clarke can not duck away from if he want to avoid a second winter of discontent ..
opening , closing .
prince charles is jolly good at opening thing .
he need to be for the next four day in hong kong , because he will be hard at work cutting ribbon and laying foundation stone .
the hong kong university of science and technology , the hong kong island divisional headquarters of the red cross , the new cultural centre , and many more .
he is even re-opening the already opened eastern harbour tunnel and subway crossing .
it is all standard royal stuff , but not much help to the million who fear that hong kong will not remain open after 1997 .
the whole point of a visit to hong kong now , five month after tiananmen square , should be to declare with royal authority that britain share the concern of the hong kong people and is determined to do something about them .
there wa already a rather perfunctory air to the queen 's visit three year ago , a if it were just a required coda to her tour of china .
when the prince and princess of wale quite rightly scrapped their tour of the mainland , they had the opportunity to make a contrasting point in hong kong .
unless they can say something relevant in the next four day , the many hong kong critic who believe the visit is a waste of dollar will be absolutely right .
it did not help at all that upon arrival yesterday the royal couple instantly touched base in that comforting symbol of past british power , the hong kong and shanghai bank .
if there is a failure of imagination to use the royal visit creatively it will also be a failure of nerve .
britain still can not decide when to play the mandarinate game of silence with the chinese and when to break the rule ( a beijing doe all the time . )
the ideal tactic should be a mixture of both , but only if a clear message can be communicated to the hong kong people that someone is standing up for them somewhere .
instead the latest development in sino-british relation have left them even more confused than before .
china claim that the hong kong government recently gave a written commitment to limit the activity of the pro-democracy movement in the territory .
the government denies this , but ha published the text of a letter from it political adviser to the new china news agency ( beijing 's embassy in hong kong ) suggesting that it did .
in a tone of meek appeasement , the letter draw attention to the arrest by hong kong police of anti-china demonstrator outside the agency 's national day reception .
it also reminds beijing that permission ha been refused for local protester to erect a replica statue of democracy on a permanent site .
it end by assuring beijing that the hong kong government will have ‘ a prudent regard for the special circumstance of hong kong and the interest and concern of the chinese government . ’
meanwhile the flood of letter of a very different sort from anxious hong kong citizen to this and every other newspaper office continues .
so do the chinese press statement asserting that hong kong is ‘ entirely a business between china and britain ’ and should not be discussed , formally or informally , at any international forum .
the only two hong kong legislator who consistently dare to speak out , mr martin lee and mr szeto wah , have been threatened with expulsion from the committee now drafting china 's post-1997 basic law .
our latest foreign secretary ha yet to publicly pick up the file marked hong kong .
there is still endless dithering on how broad a ‘ safety net ’ britain will extend to it citizen .
they may rightly feel that it is all really rather appalling .
letter to the editor
the day thrift turned into a nightmare .
by daniel john
george tyson is not a gambling man nor doe he take unnecessary risk .
he doe n't smoke or drink , and even if he wanted to , two heart attack and a by-pass operation have made the decision for him .
by his own account , mr tyson is thrifty and state quite proudly that neither he or his wife rosie are a burden on any form of social or government support .
but that is why , at the age of 68 , mr tyson is not enjoying what he had hoped would be a comfortable retirement .
a life of saving had , by 1985 , given them a small nest-egg of £15,000 on which the interest would help supplement their pension .
to the tyson , that meant nothing extravagant — just an extra £135 a month to make life at home in south ruislip , middlesex easier .
that money wa invested a might be expected of the tyson .
and for three year , it earned it return , every month .
until one morning in june 1988 when george tyson turned on the radio to hear a small , investment business called barlow clowes had collapsed .
‘ it wa about 8.30am and i wa just getting dressed when it came over on the news , ’ said mr tyson , a former clerk of work at harrow council , london .
investor in barlow clowes since 1985 , the tyson had orginally put £10,000 into the uk fund and £5,000 in gibraltar-based barlow clowes international ( bci ) .
fate determined that a short while before the business failed , they transferred the £10,000 to bci because of the better return being offered .
in the day that followed , the tyson found that they and 18,000 other investor had been the victim of a financial crash of global proportion .
of the £190million invested in both fund , bci investor faced a shortfall of up to £100million .
after the initial shock and disbelief , the tyson grew angry — at the adviser who convinced them about barlow clowes , at the midland bank manager who gave verbal assurance of it security , at the regulatory authority responsible for the investment community and at the department of trade and industry which allowed the company to trade .
‘ i felt it wa so safe , they were so professional , ’ said mr tyson .
‘ i feel appalled by the way these professional guardian have treated u .
if you were a gambling man it would not affect you , it would just be lost .
but this wa not a gamble . ’
like so many investor , mr tyson found himself having to go back to work to ease the financial strain he had hoped to avoid .
ironically , it wa the government which he partly blamed for the affair that gave him the chance to return to work after retirement .
a change in the tax rule affecting pension wa shortly followed by a job with the department of environment 's property service agency , a post which carry him through to march and may see him stay until he is 70 .
putting it a politely a he can , mr tyson said the whole affair ‘ encouraged ’ him to return to paid employment .
‘ i had n't planned to work at all . ’
and like all of the other investor , he and his wife were in a quandry .
they wanted to do something but felt powerless .
pursuing legal action would have cost them money they did n't have ( unless it meant selling their house which wa not an option ) but doing nothing left them with the feeling that justice wa n't being done .
so they compromised and gave £100 to the barlow clowes investor group which wa formed last july to represent the investor ' interest and co-ordinate the fight for compensation .
that , say mr tyson , ha been their only blessing .
‘ they are dedicated people who clearly know what they are talking about and have guided u through it .
those people are victim , too , but they have certainly kept u together . ’
that aside , the last year ha brought little respite from their own , very personal , crisis .
the tyson have yet to see any cash payment from the liquidator who have been winding up bci 's affair .
what little money ha been recovered remains the subject of a legal tussle in the court which may yet take month to resolve .
they have been told that their claim may only amount to around £11,000 of their £15,000 a capital gain tax is likely to be deducted from the total .
but until they get any money back , the tyson find themselves in the position of the gambler who gambled all and lost .
except that the tyson do n't gamble .
travel : a pilgrimage sans progress elisabeth de stroumillo potter round poitou
by elisabeth de stroumillo
people tend to look vague when you mention poitou .
‘ umm … not a part of france we know … where exactly is it ? ’
inland of la rochelle , you say ; north of cognac and east of limoges .
you sort of pas it without realising , going to the dordogne .
‘ ah yes — cognac .
nice is it ? ’
well , better than that , and one of the best thing about it is the fact that so few people , except the french themselves , bother with it .
even for france , the variety to be found is enormous .
my passion is for it numerous romanesque church , in most case humbly proportioned but elevated into unique work of art by the richness of their exquisitely-sculpted decoration ; to go to poitou/saintonge and not look at any of it church would be like going to an african game reserve and ignoring the animal .
for serious drinker there is the production of cognac to investigate around cognac , plus the chance to sample pineau , the powerful local aperitif made from young wine laced with cognac .
to the north , where poitou border on the vendee , shapely clump of tree are almost the only punctuation mark on widespreading marshy landscape ; to the south it bubble with little rolling hill .
water is everywhere : canal , stream , small busy river with charming name like the boutonne , the mignon and the belle , and big lazy river like the sevre niortaise and the charente .
the lower reach of the sevre niortaise are swollen with the water that once covered the whole area , until medieval monk started to dig a spider-web of ditch to drain it .
now the marais poitevin is a pleasantly low-profile tourist attraction where you can take canal-boat trip from village that have hardly changed in the 15-odd year i 've known them : maillezais , with a huge and rather dull ruined abbey , and coulon , where i first ate the delicious local version of moules marinieres called mouclade .
drifting between grassy polder to which farmer have to ferry their cattle in punt , or following leafy twisting lane marked only by rusty sign proclaiming the ‘ venise verte ’ , you 're in an all-green , mysteriously silent world ; only the occasional fisherman , twitching his rod above the algae-smothered water , disturbs the stillness .
there is more greenery further south in the deep forest of chize ( with the fine renaissance chateau of dampierre-sur-boutonne at it edge ) ; and more marsh to the west around rochefort and marennes , where those mussel and oyster are raised .
one of the region 's strangest townlets sits on those marsh : brouage .
somnolent now within it low grey wall and stumpy tower , it wa once rich on salt , and powerful to boot .
it had a son to be proud of : samuel champlain , founder of quebec , who wa born there around 1569 .
a century later , it had an adoptive daughter to weep for : 20-year-old marie mancini , niece of louis xiv 's minister mazarin .
she went there when her romance with the young king wa quashed for political reason .
month later , when marie had departed , louis is said to have paused nostalgically at brouage on his way to paris after marrying the spanish infanta at st jean-de-luz .
a you come back from brouage towards st jean-d'angely — on the d18 via the canalside village of pont-l'abbe-d'arnoult , with a lovely romanesque church faade — a sign at the junction of the d122 point you to the chateau whose improbably perfect lake and garden stare at you from poster throughout the region : la roche courbon .
it most surprising room , covered from ceiling to floor in 17th-century painting , should be a salon or library ; instead , a dotty stone bathtub wa set into one wall at a later date by a lady called charlotte .
she never used it , having got some of the plumbing detail wrong .
wriggling across country on the d216 to port-d'envaux , you come to two more chateau : 18th-century panloy , flaking romantically away on it hillock overlooking a bend in the charente and , almost next door , the much older , moated crazannes , half-smothered in amazing flamboyant gothic carving .
crossing the autoroute and turning north on the d127 brings you to st jean-d'angely by way of the isolated church of fenioux .
it conically-roofed tower , hugged about by a brood of smaller roof shaped like candle snuffer , is visible for mile .
st jean-d'angely is a charming little town : there are good shop a well a half-timbered house along it narrow old street , one spanned by an ancient bell-tower .
there 's also a renaissance fountain , and an extremely odd conglomeration of church building comprising one ancient ruin , one proper church , and the skeleton faade and nave of a rather pompous and unfinished 18th-century abbey .
it make a conveniently central hub : the marais poitevin village of coulon is 27 mile to the north by the d120 , which inexplicably change it number at the top of a hill to d115 .
niort is about the same distance by the parallel n150 .
saintes , with gallo-roman remains , a beautiful romanesque abbey and an atmospheric medieval quarter , is 17 mile south of st jean ; 15-odd mile to the north-west is surgeres , all of whose public building , including an engagingly asymmetrical church , are within the 16th-century castle wall , scattered among beautiful garden and parkland — perfect for picnicking .
just under 10 mile south-west of st jean , on the brouage road , st-savinien is at the upper limit of the tidal reach of the charente .
the villager ' main hobby seems to be fishing with peculiar , saucer-shaped net suspended from precariously-perched bankside hut .
one fisherman waxed lyrical about the variety of fish in the river .
‘ even salmon , ’ he assured me , ‘ but of course those are protected and must be thrown back .
which they are … normalement . ’
like almost every other poitevin town and village , st-savinien ha a sweet romanesque church ; melle , indeed ha three .
but aulnay , just over 10 mile north-east of st jean , is probably the best , it unassuming architecture a perfect frame for the sheer artistry of the carving round it door and window .
biblical motif recur — some art-experts call them sermon in stone , and their message would certainly have been clear to the often-illiterate medieval pilgrim trudging to santiago de compostela in spain .
but these theme are always interspersed with more fanciful one : grimacing mask , weird animal , exuberant abstract pattern .
i think those 10th- and 11th-century sculptor were motivated not just by piety but also by a certain competitive spirit : if a church wa finer than the one in the next village , more pilgrim would surely pause there .
today 's attraction-merchants are doing no more to lure 20th-century tourist than their medieval forebear did for pilgrim .
way of the world : farming note
by auberon waugh
many will take it a a further surrender to common market bureaucracy that an inspectorate will soon be established to regulate the smell of farm manure .
in fact , with the development of deep-litter hen house and intensive pig culture , some such control are necessary .
the smell released by a pig or chicken farm is indescribable , and can affect 10 square mile of countryside around .
one may doubt whether modern farming ha any useful purpose nowadays when everybody is on a diet .
it mostly seems to involve producing food for animal to eat , whose excrement is then collected to assist the growth of more food for animal .
small child can sometimes be persuaded to eat cow cake in the same way that old people will eat cat food , but the chief result of all this farming wa to produce huge food mountain which we could then refuse to give to the third world , or to the socialist of eastern europe , in order to teach them the error of their way .
however , there is a new plan to turn land over to wind farming .
it involves nothing more than putting up 80-foot mast all over the land .
a 1,500-acre grouse moor will generate enough electricity in this way to power a town of 6,000 people .
the farmer receives a rent of £15,000 a year and is relieved of the need to do any work for it .
all the food we need will be provided by monster underground fungus producing a regular crop of mushroom without human assistance .
the mast may seem unsightly to those unused to them , but i am sure it is simply a matter of getting accustomed .
cow were thought very unsightly when they were first introduced .
nowadays , we all swoon with pleasure at the sight of a cow .
luxury life awaits private jail inmate
by richard savill
duvet , phonecards , hot shower and video film will greet inmate at britain 's first privately-run prison when it open on monday .
the wold , a remand centre at brough , north humberside , is far removed from the insanitary condition which prevail at many jail .
the 320 inmate will be allowed out of their cell for 14 hour a day with a minimum of six hour education and 13 hour exercise a week .
the £32 million remand prison ha 156 single and 72 shared cell , each with it own lavatory and washbasin .
recreation area have telephone and pool table .
nail clipper , comb , toothpaste and toothbrush , razor and washbags are neatly laid out on table in the cell to await the arrival of inmate , many of whom will not be carrying such item because they may not have expected to be remanded in custody .
‘ the cell are luxurious compared to some of the thing we put up with in the army , ’ said one staff member during a press tour of the jail .
the prison ha a medical block with 24 bed and a gym with equipment that staff said would be the envy of many council leisure centre .
group 4 remand service ltd , the security firm selected by the home office to manage the wold in a £5 million-a-year contract , like to think of it prisoner a customer .
‘ it may seem a little odd for prison staff to be looking at their prisoner a customer , but they are the direct consumer of our service , ’ explained mr stephen twinn , prison director , who spent 23 year in the public sector at various grade of prison governor .
the 60 male warder or ‘ custody officer ’ a they are called , wear a dapper outfit of black blazer , grey trouser , white shirt and grey tie .
woman manager have a choice a to whether they wear trouser or a skirt .

city comment : there 's spring in the step of the stock market
at least last friday 's post-election stock market surge wa not a one-day special offer for the professional only .
price have remained high-indeed the ft-se index ha risen another 55 point since then — allowing even the most passive of private investor , including unit trust holder , to take advantage of the market .
the 10 p.c. gain since election day is looking increasingly sustainable .
it is not that prospect for earnings are 10 p.c. better that they were in the middle of last week , but it is possible to argue that prospect are that much better than they would have been under a labour government and that the market wa discounting such a result .
the ft-se failed to hold it gain yesterday but shortly after opening it wa only six point away from last september 's previous record closing level .
wall street ha been hitting new peak this week too , which ha given support to the london market ( and even japan 's nikkei index , in a typically erratic period , ha gained nearly 800 point while london added it 245 ) but london ha real strength of it own .
the city view is that the fall in corporate earnings ha stopped and that next year 's increase could be around 15 p.c .
the market 's price-earnings multiple wa 16 last night but it would drop below 14 if that increase in earnings really happens .
the increase will not be matched by dividend rise — too many company have been paying more than they could afford over the past two year and need to repair their reserve and ratio — but 7 p.c. growth look reasonable .
the market yield , a historic 4¾ p.c. , could return back above 5 p.c. , therefore giving basic-rate taxpayer a real return with the prospect of real growth too .
not all problem have gone away of course : yesterday 's £6.4 billion public sector borrowing requirement is not much higher than expectation , but it is almost a large a the deficit for the previous 11 month and — with this year 's deficit forecast to be double last year 's — show why the bank of england so eagerly sold £2 billion or more of gilt on election night and why it need a regular stream of massive sale .
the change in employment may not always be so favourable a yesterday 's either , but the market is now starting to feel bullish and looking for a ft-se of 3,000 by next year .
part 2 sociology and crime
explaining crime : theory of criminality
most people have their own notion or theory a to what cause criminal behaviour .
for example , lack of discipline in the home , genetic defect , poverty , mixing with the ‘ wrong sort ’ have all been proposed a cause of criminality .
while such notion may all contains some element of truth , they are by no mean complete explanation of criminal behaviour .
this chapter will examine a range of theory which attempt to explain such behaviour .
although the major theoretical explanation are covered in the numerous introduction to the sociology of crime and deviance and to sociology generally , some review of these theory is necessary before embarking upon an examination of specific , substantive example of criminal behaviour .
a this is not a book on criminological theory , what follows will be a brief overview of a wide range of theory and explanation .
first , a word of warning might be in order .
it would be naive to expect to uncover any ultimate explanation or basic cause for criminal behaviour , given the extensive and diverse behaviour that is encompassed by the term crime .
suppose , for example , that it could be proved that one cause of delinquency wa lack of parental supervision .
it might still be necessary to ask why delinquency occurred with one son or daughter but not another .
also , there would be the further question of why the parent had not provided adequate supervision .
perhaps this wa because of their poor living condition which would raise the question of why they were in poor housing .
wa this because of governmental housing policy or a poor employment record on the part of the bread-winner of the family ?
clearly , we are getting further and further away from the cause of delinquent behaviour , and it is perhaps wisest to think in term of causal process when looking at criminal behaviour .
biological and psychological theory
before examining the major sociological on crime , it is useful to refer to theory from outside of sociology , from other academic discipline .
thus , we will look initially at biological and psychological theory .
biological theory
biological ( or physiological ) explanation are based on the notion that some individual are predisposed to criminal behaviour because of their genetic make-up .
the individual criminal is born so ; and this is usually put down to ‘ faulty chromosome pattern ’ , or , more vaguely , to ‘ hereditary trait ’ .
the most famous exponent of this approach wa the nineteenth-century italian physician , cesare lombroso .
in his book l'uomo delinquente , lombroso developed a complex description of what he called the ‘ born criminal ’ , who could be recognised by a variety of physical characteristic , in particular facial characteristic — for example large jaw and ear , and high cheek bone .
in the medical faculty at the university of rome there is a gallery of portrait of splendidly ugly delinquent who were used to illustrate lombroso 's theory .
to use his own language :
thus were explained anatomically the enormous jaw , high cheek bone , prominent superciliary arch , solitary line on the palm , extreme size of the orbit , handle-shaped or sessile ear found in criminal , savage and ape , insensibility of pain , extremely acute sight , tattooing , excessive idleness , love of orgy and the craving for evil for it own sake …
these explanation see the delinquent individual a inherently more prone to criminal behaviour than the non-delinquent .
they have been widely criticised and rejected by sociologist .
lombroso 's work , for example , wa based on his examination of people in prison in italy .
this would , necessarily , ignore the fact that many criminal do not go to prison , and that , perhaps , people in prison are not always criminal .
most advocate of biological theory do not express themselves in the same bizarre language and style a lombroso , and such theory of crime are not merely historical relic that died with lombroso .
in a major study of institutionalised delinquent ( delinquent in some form of custody ) in the usa in the 1950s , sheldon and eleanor glueck found that delinquent boy were twice a likely to have a mesomorphic build , a chunky , muscular , compared with non-delinquent boy .
however , the fact that the study wa restricted to institutionalised delinquent limit the validity of the association between body build and crime and delinquency .
it may be that tougher-looking delinquent are more liable to be put away than fragile looking one .
furthermore , it ha been found that the association between delinquency on the one hand and height , weight and physique on the other is greatly reduced once social , background factor are taken into account .
for example , lower working-class people are more likely to be mesomorphic a a result of their diet and continual manual labour , and this class grouping is more likely to be found represented in the criminal statistic .
with regard to the link between criminal behaviour and inherited characteristic , there have been a number of theoretical explanation suggesting an association between criminality and particular personality characteristic .
an example of this more sophisticated biological approach is the work of han eysenck , who ha argued in a series of study , that there is a link between genetically based personality characteristic and criminal behaviour .
he maintains that there is a link between characteristic such a extroversion and criminal behaviour .
an individual 's degree of extroversion or introversion is inherited , determined by his or her genetic make-up .
the link with crime found by eysenck wa that when prisoner were tested for extroversion , more extrovert were found than in the general population .
eysenck then argues that extroversion is the inherited basis of criminal behaviour .
extrovert take longer to learn the rule of society , they are more likely to break them , and thus more likely become convicted criminal .
a with lombroso 's work and the gluecks ' study discussed above , by starting with institutionalised criminal , it is assumed that all prisoner are criminal and that most criminal do , in fact , go to prison .
the people who get caught and imprisoned may not be a representative picture of all criminal .
the major problem faced by theory suggesting a link between genetic make-up and criminal behaviour is the difficulty of distinguishing between genetic and environmental effect .
while some genetic influence can not be ruled out , just what is inherited remains very unclear .
psychological theory
these theory share certain similarity with biological explanation .
they stress the link between criminal behaviour and specific personality trait or characteristic .
psychological theory , however , see these characteristic a a result of unusual or abnormal experience , rather than a inherited .
thus , a with biological theory , crime is seen a pathological ( a disease ) , a something to be looked at from the medical point of view .
however , psychological cause are seen a treatable , whereas biological cause mark the individual for life .
in those case there is no possible treatment , one is born a criminal .
many psychological theory refer to faulty parent-child relationship , such a abnormal experience in early childhood having a lasting effect and influence on personality .
study in this area have indicated that too strict or too lax parental attitude increase the risk of delinquency ( the work of john bowlby , for example ) ; they have found that if a young child is deprived of close personal relationship with parent or parent figure then ‘ problem behaviour ’ is more common .
it is well established that in the delinquent-prone , home discipline is more liable to be too lax , strict or erratic .
however , it is patently obvious that parent can be a good or bad influence and example for their child , and this fact can hardly be used to explain present pattern of crime .
the majority of offender do not come from disturbed or broken home , and many broken home do not produce delinquent .
of course , this last point doe not show that there is no link between parent-child relation and crime and delinquency .
the problem with assessing the influence of parental and family dimension , such a weak supervision or parental criminality , is the fact that they are closely linked to various aspect of social and economic disadvantage , such a poverty , overcrowding and poor housing .
and it may be that these disadvantage help to cause parental difficulty , and hamper good parenting .
we can hardly do justice to the wide scope of psychological theory here , but there are some basic idea and assumption which underlie such theorizing .
these stress the importance of family relationship and upbringing during the early year , and conclude that anti-social , and by implication criminal , behaviour result from faulty personality development .
to summarise , these biological and psychological theory hold that the criminal is a particular type of person , apart from the rest of society and with a special predisposition toward criminal behaviour .
they are based on the idea that criminal behaviour is either inherited or a consequence of unique , individual experience .
before we look at sociological explanation it might be useful to ask yourself , or to discus with colleague , whether you feel that criminal are different ‘ type ’ of person .
while there are , no doubt , predisposition toward criminal behaviour , and clearly certain characteristic are inherited , most sociologist would reject these ‘ individual pathology ’ sort of theory .
they lack convincing supporting evidence .
while some offender suffer from mental disorder the vast majority do not .
furthermore , if criminal are abnormal then it follows that a large proportion of the population must also be abnormal .
for numerous study have shown that a high percentage of the population have committed criminal offence , in particular high proportion of juvenile , and it is difficult to believe that they are all different or abnormal .
sociological theory
we said above that sociologist would reject non-sociological explanation of crime .
this is not because such explanation are ‘ wrong ’ , but because they are incomplete or inadequate .
in chapter one , it wa stressed that crime can not be considered aside from it social context , that it is dependent on society defining certain action a criminal , and on the reaction of others to such action .
chapter nine
‘ i have a very important assignment for you , paula , ’ arlene frampton-cox said .
she inserted a du maurier cigarette into her long tortoiseshell holder and sat back , looking at paula , who wa seated in the visitor 's chair on the other side of the desk , long leg crossed elegantly .
paula looked every inch a model these day , arlene thought with a touch of proprietorial pride .
her long hair , shining gold , wa swept back and caught at the nape of her neck with a bow , make-up , expertly applied , accentuated the classically beautiful line of her face , and she wore her well-cut suit with all the panache that wa expected of her .
a good suit wa a working model 's uniform — paula now bought two each season and wore them with perfectly matching accessory , hat , bag and shoe .
this one wa in soft light green with a boxy shaped jacket and narrow skirt and the same green-and-white check material of the little sleeveless blouse had been used to line the jacket and face the wide revere .
paula 's bag and shoe were patent black leather , her glove white , and she carried a long walking umbrella neatly furled in it fur-trimmed case .
perfectly groomed from head to toe and with all that assurance , she wa ready to take on the world , arlene thought with satisfaction , for she looked on paula a her very own creation .
the raw material might have been there before — indeed , had n't it been she , arlene , who had spotted them ?
but the transformation of a leggy young filly into a sleekly beautiful racehorse had been her doing .
eighteen month on the model circuit had eliminated all trace of her former somerset accent .
she had listened to arlene 's own voice and set about imitating it for she held her mentor in the highest esteem whilst still being a little afraid of her .
the house of mattli is expanding from couture into ready-to-wear and one of the big bristol store , taylor , are putting on a show to publicise the fact that they will be stocking the new prêt-è-porter ' , arlene explained .
‘ i have been asked to supply the model and i would like you to be one of them . ’
‘ mattli ! ’
paula repeated , impressed .
the house of mattli wa a husband and wife team who were numbered amongst the top ten name in the incorporated society of london fashion designer .
furthermore madame mattli wa a frenchwoman , an accident of birth which added to her glamour , for wa not paris the fashion capital of the world ?
‘ madame mattli will be coming to bristol herself , ’ arlene continued .
‘ taylor have a certain amount of stock but she will be bringing extra sample from london especially for the show .
i only want the best of my girl on this job .
madame mattli , remember , is used to the best .
we ca n't afford any sloppiness .
i can count on you , paula , i feel sure . ’
‘ oh yes , ’ paula said , brimming with suppressed excitement .
‘ you can count on me ! ’
madame mattli wa almost exactly a paula had imagined she would be , a petite perfectly turned out woman with an air of chic that wa unmistakably french .
her dark , grey-streaked hair , which she wore in a long bob , had been cut by vidal sassoon and she wore a beautifully tailored black suit relieved only by a little white flounce at the neckline .
in the fitting room at taylor she fussed and fretted over her creation like a mother hen and though paula wa overawed by the great designer she also liked her on sight .
madame mattli might be a stickler for detail , with a generous helping of the artistic temperament which kept her tight-coiled a a spring and which would explode into frenzy if the smallest detail wa not a it should be , but she also had a kind face and deep perceptive eye .
half way through the day 's programme of show , while the dresser went off to grab a sandwich and the model girl , who would not dare to eat while they were showing , revived themselves with cup of black coffee , madame mattli took paula to one side .
‘ little one , i would like to speak with you . ’
paula 's stomach turned a somersault .
had she done something wrong ?
‘ i have been watching you work , ’ madame mattli said directly .
her accent reminded paula of louise — perhaps that wa why she warmed to her in spite of the fact that she wa so awe-inspiring .
‘ you are exactly right for a couture model .
you have all the physical attribute . ’
‘ thank you , ’ paula said faintly .
madame mattli waved a dismissive hand .
‘ do not thank me .
i am not saying this to make your head swell .
on the contrary .
the fact is that i have a vacancy arising for a couture model .
i believe you are exactly what i am looking for .
i would like you to come to london to work for me . ’
over madame mattli 's shoulder paula could see arlene watching her , a tiny smile lifting one corner of her scarlet mouth , and paula knew her well enough by now to know exactly what she wa thinking .
she did not want to lose paula , who wa one of her best model , but already she wa enjoying the reflected glory that came from having personally trained a house model for one of the great london couture house .
she had known about the vacancy at mattli and hoped that the job might be offered to paula .
it wa the seal of approval for her own judgement .
‘ well ? ’
madame mattli demanded .
‘ can i have a little time to think it over ? ’
paula asked boldly .
‘ a little .
but please do not delay too long .
my present house model leaf at the end of the month and there are plenty of girl who would jump at the chance . ’
‘ i 'm sure .
but all the same i could n't make such a move without giving it some thought , ’ paula said grandly .
but inside she wa bubbling with excitement .
time to think ?
she did n't need a single second .
the moment madame mattli had offered her the job she had made up her mind .
she wa going to take it — of course !
a month later paula , smartly dressed in a new tweed suit with the obligatory matching bag and shoe , and lugging both her modelling case and a brand new cream leather suitcase , took the train to london to begin her new career .
she had booked herself a bed at a ywca hostel for the time being .
it wa not quite what she envisaged for herself but it had the advantage of being cheap and it went some way towards satisfying grace , who wa convinced that london wa a den of iniquity waiting to swallow up her unsuspecting daughter .
from the hostel it wa only a short tube ride to south audley street where madame mattli had her showroom — yet another advantage , paula thought , trying to weigh up the point in favour of the hostel , which she hated on sight .
sharing a small spartan room with two other girl — northerner whose accent paula found almost incomprehensible and with whom she had nothing in common , making breakfast in the communal kitchen , queuing for the bath , adhering to a strict curfew after which time the door were locked and bolted — none of these were restriction paula had the slightest intention of enduring for long .
but for now it would have to do .
and at least she wa in london , centre of the british fashion industry .
a for the house of mattli , it might have been in a different world to the hostel , with it air of being a cross between a workhouse and a boarding school .
the first time she rang the bell and went in through the front door of the elegant old house where the showroom were situated ( mattli had no rear entrance ) paula felt she wa stepping into the place of her dream .
deep carpet covered the floor and the stair swept up to the showroom and the warren of workroom beyond , and though the window drape and furnishing were ever-so-slightly faded , a if they had seen better day , they were of the finest silk and velvet and every corner wa swept , polished and cleaned daily so that no single speck of dust , let alone a cobweb , dared show itself .
the showroom wa neither large nor small , decorated in muted shade of aubergine which would not detract from the clothes .
there wa a low table and three or four dainty chair with aubergine velvet seat and gilded spindle leg .
the crystal chandelier wa for effect only — lighting that would show off the clothes to their best advantage wa brilliant yet discreet , and along one wall were rack holding some of the ready-to-wear garment .
in contrast to this elegant frontage the workroom beyond were a hive of frenzied activity .
pattern cutter , fitter , sewing hand and their assistant all worked at an incredible speed .
this , paula soon discovered , wa the way of the fashion world — a constant frantic rush against the clock , to have collection ready on time or to complete individual couture garment for customer who always considered their order more urgent , more important , than that of anyone else .
paula wa amazed by the security arrangement that were necessary to ensure that the new season 's collection remained exclusive — the window at the rear of the premise were heavily barred and practically the first thing she had to do on commencing her employment wa to sign a contract promising that she would not breathe a word about the design she saw .
on her second day madame mattli took her to vidal sassoon 's salon in grosvenor house so that her hair could be cut in an up-to-the-minute style .
unlike some couturier madame did not mind if her model girl did not have the same colour hair but she did insist on identical style .
by the time vidal sassoon had finished with her paula 's long fair lock had been shorn to a sharp geometric shape and she scarcely recognised the reflection that looked back at her from the mirror .
among the rich and famous who had come to the salon to have their hair cut , tinted and set , paula recognised dusty springfield , the pop singer , her eye big and sooty , her lip pearly pink , and wa unable to suppress the thrill of excitement which ran through her .
this wa her very first taste of only the best being good enough — and she liked it !
it wa paula 's job to show sample , parading slowly up and down in front of the client a they sat on the elegant spindle-leg chair taking in every detail of the garment with a critical and practised eye .
sometimes they came alone , sometimes with a man in tow — to foot the bill !
paula guessed .
the appearance of a famous face in the show room always caused a stir amongst the girl , who all longed to hook a wealthy husband — and if he had a title , like the aly khan , or wa a film star like omar shariff , then so much the better !
not everything that paula had to do wa quite so glamorous , however .
in the long hour when there were no customer to show she wa expected to lend a hand with some of the unskilled task — running errand and making tea , unpicking a seam or a hem , even sewing on a button or a hook and eye when she had been taught the proper way to do it .
paula wa not very clever with her needle but she soon learned to be careful so a not to incur the wrath of the seamstress .
there were new trick of modelling to be learned too — how to remove a coat , sliding it carefully off her shoulder with the sleeve hanging in perfect balance , never for one moment allowing the inside to be on view , for sample were often unlined .
this trick took hour of practice , up and down the landing at the hostel while the other girl looked at her a if she had taken leave of her sens .
although she enjoyed her job paula wa lonely .
even the most popular of girl soon discovered that in this highly competitive world where model vied with one another for the most glamorous job and the wealthiest and best-looking men there wa far more bitchiness than in the province — and paula wa far from popular .
the other girl disliked her for her outstanding look and her haughty way and made no attempt to be friendly on anything but the most superficial level and the pattern cutter and sewing hand hurried home to their family and boyfriend the moment they finished their long day 's work .
paula spent most of her free time alone , window shopping , visiting news theatre , where she sometimes watched the programme of cartoon twice round , and drinking endless cup of espresso coffee in cafés and coffee house .
her favourite wa the coffee shop in fenwicks in bond street for this wa the haunt and the meeting place of all those from the world of fashion .
one lunchtime when she had been at the house of mattli for a few month paula went there for her usual coffee and the cottage cheese salad that wa her staple diet now that it wa so important that she did not add a single half-inch to her wand-slim figure .
she took her tray to the pay desk , opened her bag and felt for her purse .
it wa not there .
frantically she rooted round , then checked her pocket without success .
‘ i 'm sorry .
i seem to have lost my purse … ’ she explained .
the girl behind the till stared at her stonily .
paula wa going hot and cold by now .
had it been stolen ?
no , she remembered her bag tipping over in the cloakroom at mattli — it must have fallen out then .
but without it she could not pay for her coffee and salad .
‘ having trouble ? ’ a voice beside her asked .
‘ do n't worry .
let me . ’
paula turned gratefully , then gasped with surprise a she recognised the slight figure in black roll-neck sweater and skin tight pant .
‘ i do n't believe it !
gary oliver !
what are you doing here ? ’
‘ the same a you i expect , paula — getting my strength up to face the rest of the day .
let me pay and then we 'll have lunch together and do some catching up — unless you 're meeting someone , of course . ’
‘ no — no , i 'm not . ’
paula picked up her try and moved aside waiting for him , flushed with pleasure at seeing a familiar face .
gary oliver wa a designer , young and very talented .
she had met him back home in the west country when he had come to supervise a show put on by one of the big ready-to-wear label , carnega , for whom he worked a a junior member of the design team .
for a whole week they had worked closely together , sharing flask of coffee and packet of cigarette and paula had grown to like the pixieish little man who by his very nature offered her no challenge — and no threat .
gary should have been a girl , she had thought , for he wa half a head smaller than she wa with fair curling hair , baby-blue eye and long thick lash that were the envy of every woman who met him .
‘ shall we sit over there in the corner ? ’
gary suggested .
he led the way , his slim hip in the tight fitting pant snaking gracefully between the table .
they unloaded their tray on to a table .
‘ what are you doing in london then , paula ?
apart from mislaying your purse , i mean . ’
he grinned at her impishly .
she told him .
‘ and what about you ?
are n't you with carnega any more ? ’
he shook his head .
dimple played in his cheek .
‘ no — now i 'm with the house of oliver . ’
‘ the house of oliver … ?
oh ! ’ she squealed a light dawned .
‘ your own house ?
you 've set up a a designer in your own right , gary ! ’
‘ yep .
in a small way at the moment , of course , but thing are happening .
i came into a bit of money when my grandmother died and i decided to put it to good use . ’
‘ is n't it a bit of a risk ? ’
paula asked .
he shrugged his narrow shoulder .
‘ perhaps .
but i wanted to work for myself .
designing clothes for carnega wa all very well and i made a good living at it i wo n't deny but i wanted to be free to do my own thing — and to have my own name on the label .
i have quite a few contact — people who knew me when i wa designing for carnega — and they have been very encouraging .
so i have decided to move to london and open a showroom .
in fact i have just been looking at a place in south audley street , not far from mattli .
if it work out we shall practically be neighbour , paula . ’
‘ what a small world !
i had no idea , ’ paula said , surprised she had not already heard the news .
usually the slightest whisper travelled like jungle drum through the world of fashion .
until now gary had been an out-of-town designer , of course .
but if he wa moving to london his new fashion house would soon be a talking point .
‘ we must keep in touch , ’ gary said a he finished his cheese roll .
‘ promise you 'll look in and say hello when you have time . ’
‘ i will .
apart from anything else i owe you a coffee . ’
‘ true .
i do n't suppose i could persuade you to work for me in return ?
i 'm looking for a couple of good model .
though i do n't suppose i could afford to pay you a well a mattli doe — yet .
maybe one day … ’
paula laughed .
‘ i do n't earn that much !
by the time i 've paid for my room at the ywca and bought all the make-up and clothes i need there never seems to be anything left over .
i 'm looking for a rich husband to take me away from it all . ’
‘ and i 'm sure one day you 'll find him .
in the meantime , do n't forget your friend , eh paula ? ’
‘ i wo n't , ’ she promised , glancing at her watch .
‘ oh hell , i shall have to go . ’
‘ me too .
but it wa great to see you again , paula . ’
they walked back to south audley street together , weaving their way through the lunchtime crowd on the pavement , the tall , striking girl and the young man whose pixieish look belied his twenty-six year .
outside the front entrance of the house of mattli paula turned to give him a quick impulsive hug .
‘ thanks for the lunch , gary .
and good luck with your new venture ! ’
she held up her finger , tightly crossed for him .
he grinned .
‘ i 'll need it .
do n't forget to come and see me , will you ?
i shall be expecting you . ’
‘ i wo n't forget .
'bye for now ! ’ she called , and ran in through the imposing front door .
madame mattli wa furious .
in all the time she had been with her paula had never seen her so angry .
‘ i hear you have been seen going into the house of oliver , ’ she said , her immaculately painted lip tight with fury .
beside her monsieur mattli , a small greek-looking man , some ten year her senior , wa also quivering with indignation .
‘ not once but several time , ’ he added .
it wa so unusual for him to contribute anything to the conversation that paula glanced at him in surprise .
though he wa always in evidence it wa invariably madame who did all the talking , giving order , fussing around client , so that paula wa never quite certain what his role wa .
‘ gary oliver is a friend , ’ she said defensively .
madame mattli snorted angrily .
‘ i do not pay you to have friend in rival fashion house . ’
‘ he 's not a rival … ’
paula broke off .
it seemed ridiculous that a newcomer like gary could be any threat to a well-established house like mattli .
but in the cut-throat world of fashion up and coming designer were to be feared — and already gary 's reputation wa growing .
‘ you know that we insist on complete loyalty , ’ madame mattli continued .
‘ the security of our design is paramount .
oh paula , how could you ! ’
‘ but i would never mention anything i have seen here ! ’
paula protested .
madame snorted again .
‘ how can i be sure of that ?
even if you do not intend to be disloyal there is always the risk that you might be careless .
pillow talk is the most dangerous . ’
‘ pillow talk ! ’
paula repeated , stunned .
close though her friendship with gary had become she had never once breathed a word to him about the new collection she saw taking shape at mattli — and a for ‘ pillow talk ’ the notion wa absurd .
there wa nothing like that between them and never would be .
gary wa not interested in girl .
surely that must be obvious to everyone who met him .
‘ you must stop visiting him , ’ madame said firmly .
‘ either i have your word on it or i am afraid you can no longer remain in my employ .
i want you to promise me here and now that you will not see gary oliver again . ’
paula wa trembling .
her job with the house of mattli wa her life .
but to allow herself to be dictated to in this way when she knew she had done nothing wrong wa tantamount to admitting guilt .
and she could n't bear the thought of being sucked back into the ebb tide of loneliness again either .
with gary she enjoyed a relationship she had never experienced with anyone else — the easy-going friendship of a male who made no demand whatever on her — and it meant more to her than she had realised .
‘ i have never betrayed any confidence and i never will .
but you ca n't expect me to cut myself off from my friend , ’ she said .
‘ i am afraid i do expect it , paula , in this case . ’
‘ i ca n't promise not to see gary again . ’
‘ very well . ’
there wa a hint of sadness now in madame 's eye but her mouth wa set and determined .
‘ i shall be sorry to lose you , paula .
you are a good model and you suited me very well .
but you leave me no choice .
please do not bother to come in again .
i shall contact the agency for a replacement immediately .
and i warn you , if any of my design or anything like them turn up in the showroom at the house of oliver i shall sue — and win the sort of damage that will put your little friend out of business for good .
do i make myself clear ? ’
paula wa still afraid of madame mattli — and she wa also close to tear .
but she wa determined madame should not be aware of either .
‘ yes , madame .
i 'm sorry to leave you , but i assure you you need not worry on that score . ’
the showroom of the house of oliver were smaller and le grand than those at the house of mattli but the décor wa newer and fresher , pale grey drape , ultra modern black furniture and a great deal of gleaming stainless steel .
gary wa in the workroom when paula arrived , pinning a length of vibrant pink chiffon sarong-style around one of his model .
his mouth wa full of pin .
‘ what are you doing here ? ’ he asked without moving his lip .
paula perched herself against the cutting table trying to look nonchalant .
‘ i 've left mattli , ’ she said .
gary stared at her for a moment , pin spewing from his mouth and catching on the front of his black jersey .
then he unpinned the length of chiffon and let it fall to the floor .
the model stood motionless , clad in nothing but her bra and stocking , waiting for his instruction .
‘ we 'll leave this for now , claudia ’ , he said .
‘ see if you can rustle up a cup of tea for paula and me , please . ’
the girl pulled on her wrap and moved to the door looking back over her shoulder a she went and paula wa aware of the hostility in her gaze .
why wa it all woman hated her so , even when they did n't know her ?
she shrugged .
oh well , she should be used to it by now …
gary got up , took paula by the arm and led her over to the low sofa .
‘ what 's all this about , lovey ?
you ca n't have left mattli . ’
‘ i have . ’
paula related what had happened and saw gary turn pale .
‘ oh lord !
you mean she think you 've been spying for me !
if she sue i 'll be ruined .
even worse , someone of her stature could make a hell of a lot of trouble for me , even if she doe n't . ’
‘ but gary — i have n't been spying for you !
i have n't even mentioned a single detail of the mattli collection . ’
‘ you know that and so do i. but suppose i 've done something similar ?
it happens every season — by sheer chance and law of average some of the idea are bound to come up .
there are always accusation of piracy and copy-catting , though they ca n't usually be substantiated .
but if she can prove that you and i … ’
‘ that 's nonsense !
we have n't done anything wrong . ’
gary ran a distracted hand through his mop of fair hair .
‘ you 're going to have to describe the mattli collection to me .
every detail . ’
‘ gary ! ’ she objected , shocked .
‘ you 're an original .
you ca n't steal their idea ! ’
‘ no , idiot — not so that i can steal them .
so that i can go through my design and make quite certain that there is not one collar , not one cuff detail , not the slightest influence that they could accuse me of copying from them .
oh jesus christ ! — suppose there 's something major ?
my peg top evening gown — my beautiful cerise lace — i could end up having to rethink the whole collection ! ’
‘ for goodness sake stop panicking ! ’
paula said , though she could feel the seed of panic herself .
‘ i 'm sure there 's nothing to worry about . ’
‘ i only hope you 're right ! ’ he said in anguished tone .
the model came in with the cup of tea , still glowering darkly at paula from beneath her fringe of false eyelash .
it wa clear she wa blaming paula bitterly for the interrupted afternoon and her bos 's drastic change of mood .
‘ that girl is a dog ! ’
paula said when they were alone again .
‘ i 'm sure she ca n't do justice to your design .
and with a miserable face like hers i 'm surprised you ever get any work done at all . ’
gary looked crestfallen .
‘ she 's the best i could get … ’
‘ oh what rubbish ! ’
paula said roundly .
‘ anyway , you 've got me now so you can get rid of her . ’
‘ what do you mean ? ’
gary asked .
he looked like a worried small boy .
‘ i told you — i 've left mattli .
i 'll come and work for you . ’
‘ oh paula ! ’
gary 's expression became even more anxious .
‘ you know i 'd give my right arm to have someone a good a you to model for me !
but i told you before — i could n't afford to pay you what you 're worth .
well , not for age , anyway .
it 's going to be a long struggle getting established and until i am i do n't see how … ’
paula smiled .
for the first time she felt the stirring of something like power .
it wa not unlike the feeling she experienced when men looked at her and wanted her though she knew it could not be that for there wa nothing sexual between her and gary and never would be .
but it wa just a exciting , nevertheless .
it made her feel strong , invincible almost , and just a tiny bit a if she had drunk too much wine .
her smile spread .
we beat southward all that first day , slicing through a glittering sea , and propelled by an apparently changeless south-easterly trade wind .
we hardly saw the crowninshield twin .
they briefly appeared on deck for lunch ; a meal which rickie hardly touched , while robin-anne , despite her apparent frailty , attacked the sandwich and salad with the savagery of a starving bear .
afterwards , incongruously dressed in a raincoat , she went to the bow and stared briefly down at the mesmerising onrush of sea where it split and foamed at wavebreaker 's cutwater .
she did not stay there long , but retreated from the fierce sun to the stern-cabin that she would be sharing with ellen .
the contrast between the two american girl wa almost painful ; ellen wa so healthy and strong , while the waif-like robin-anne wa pathetically wan and listless .
‘ what do you think of her ? ’
i asked ellen that afternoon .
ellen gave me an amused glance .
‘ little orphan annie ?
it 's hard to believe she 's about to be worth six million dollar .
still , she 's got precious little else going for her . ’
i smiled at the severity of ellen 's judgment .
‘ is she that bad ? ’
‘ she ha a distressingly simple mind , with only room for a single idea at any one time .
presently that idea is cocaine , and nothing but cocaine .
she ha an obsession with the drug that verge on monomania .
she tell me she need to understand it if she 's going to defeat it . ’
‘ do n't you approve of that ? ’
‘ i think she 'd do better to understand herself , ’ ellen said tartly .
‘ she allowed a man to persuade her into taking the drug , so she can only blame herself for her predicament .
she 'd find it more useful to understand her own character short­comings than to take an elementary course in drug chemistry . ’
‘ what do you make of rickie ? ’
i asked .
‘ he 's precisely what anyone would expect of a drop-out phys ed basketball-playing retard , ’ ellen said scornfully , ‘ by which i mean that he 's a jock with the brain of a dung beetle .
he reminds me of your neanderthal friend , the maggot , except rickie is a great deal more handsome . ’
‘ is he ? ’
she laughed at the suspicion of jealousy in my voice .
‘ yes , nicholas , he is .
but he 's not cute . ’
at supper , a at lunch , robin-anne ate with the appetite of a horse , though her brother hardly touched his chicken and pasta salad .
‘ do n't you like pasta ? ’
ellen , who wa perversely proud of her skill in the salad department , asked rickie with just a touch of asperity .
‘ it 's great .
really awesome . ’
rickie lit a cigarette .
‘ i just guess i 'm not hungry . ’
robin-anne reached over and tipped her brother 's food on to her own plate .
‘ kind of starving , ’ she justified her theft , then poured herself some diet soda .
for once we were carrying neither wine nor spirit on wavebreaker , for jackson chatterton 's drug clinic had utterly forbidden u to offer the twin any alcohol , saying that any mood-altering drug could hamper the success of a detoxification programme .
we were thus officially a dry boat , though i had hidden some irish whiskey in the engine room , and i wa sure that ellen would have similarly salted away some vodka .
it seemed that ellen and i were not the only one to take such a precaution , for late that night jackson chatterton lumbered on deck with a bottle in one huge hand .
‘ bourbon , ’ he explained laconically .
‘ want some ? ’
‘ i thought you 'd never ask . ’
he chuckled , produced two cardboard cup , and poured me a generous slug of the whiskey .
we were alone on deck , though not the only one awake for i could hear rickie and ellen 's voice coming from the open skylight of the main saloon .
i hoped thessy wa fast asleep for he would be taking the morning watch .
‘ cheer , ’ i said .
chatterton raised his cardboard cup in silent acknowledgement , then stared ahead to where a great beam swept around the sky .
‘ a lighthouse ? ’ he asked in a voice which suggested that a prudent man avoided such thing .
i nodded .
‘ it 's called the hole in the wall .
once we 're past it we can turn out to the open ocean .
thing will be a bit livelier then . ’
‘ livelier ? ’
‘ we 'll have a bit more sea , kick up some spray . ’
i had spoken enthusiastically , but jackson chatterton seemed unmoved by the prospect .
‘ what are your plan ? ’ he asked me .
i had nothing particular planned , merely an idea that it might be interesting to thrash our way out into the open ocean , though , mindful of the danger of tropical storm , i had no intention of going too far from the safe shelter of a bahamian hurricane hole .
but i fancied feeling the long hard pressure of ocean wave against our hull and , though we were short-handed , i reckoned that a few day out of sight of land would shake u all down quickly .
i explained all that to chatterton , but stressed that we would run for cover at the first sign of trouble .
he must have assumed that i meant trouble from the twin , for he suddenly became surprisingly loquacious .
‘ they wo n't give you any grief in the next few day , ’ he said .
‘ now that they ca n't get hold of cocaine they 'll just crash out . ’
i grimaced .
‘ doe that mean they 'll be seeing green monkey and blue snake up the rigging ? ’
chatterton poured himself more bourbon , then put the bottle within my reach on the binnacle shelf .
‘ coming off cocaine is n't like that .
at first they 'll just want to do nothing but eat and sleep .
it 's the opposite of a cocaine high , you see . ’
he paused .
‘ the difficult bit start two or three day later .
that 's when the real hell begin . ’
‘ for all of u ? ’
‘ it wo n't be easy , ‘ he said grimly , and i wa suddenly rather glad to have the taciturn chatterton aboard .
the big man had obviously come on deck to warn me what to expect from the twin , and for that i wa grateful .
‘ i noticed that rickie wa n't eating today , ’ i said , ‘ but robin-anne wa ? ’
chatterton nodded .
‘ rickie may have stopped his cocaine a day or two ago , which mean he 's probably already over the crash period .
i promise you one thing ; he 's brought none of it on board .
i searched him and his luggage , and he wa clean . ’
the big man thought for a few second , then laughed .
‘ he 'd better be clean !
that turkey ha got one chance of avoiding jail , just one , and that chance is by proving to the judge that he 's cleaned up his act .
and if he doe n't do that , then the man will send rickie 's plump young as down to the gang-rape squad in the county jail . ’
chatterton did not sound unduly worried at that prospect .
‘ can we be sure robin-anne did n't bring any of the drug aboard ? ’
i asked .
‘ she wo n't have done that , ’ chatterton said with conviction .
‘ that girl is serious about giving it up , real serious , heavy serious !
that girl is really trying !
she study the drug , you know ?
like it wa her enemy . ’
chatterton had spoken with genuine admiration .
i glanced up at the sail , down at the compass , then ahead to where the lighthouse loom arced powerfully through the night .
‘ so what are the twin , chance ? ’
‘ depends on their will power , 'cause nothing else will do it for them .
there ai n't no pill to get you off the powder , mr breakspear , only will power .
and let me tell you , coming off coke is the hardest damn thing in the world , and you 're real lucky if you have a rich daddy who pay for people to hold your hand while you go through the hell of it .
the twin ’ daddy ha paid for you and me , mr breakspear , and for everyone else on board this boat , but even with all that money and all this boat , we still might not succeed with them . ’
‘ it 's that hard ? ’
‘ it is that hard , ’ he said ominously , and i thought of john maggovertski 's sadness for a pretty girl who had whored herself to pay for the white powder .
‘ and it 's even harder , ’ jackson chatterton 's voice wa suddenly sinister , ‘ for a poor person who ha no one to help them . ’
i stared at jackson chatterton , and at last sensed the drama that lay behind his big calm presence .
‘ why did you leave the army , mr chatterton ? ’
i asked after a long pause .
‘ i guess you can guess , ’ he said .
i guessed , but did not make him confirm my guess .
instead i
asked whether the american army had helped him to kick his drug habit .
‘ sure they tried , they tried real hard , but back then i did n't
want to be helped . ’
‘ but you still got off cocaine ?
on your own ? ’
‘ eventually . ’
the light inside the binnacle glossed his black
face with a sheen of red , sparking his eye like fire .
he wa not looking at me , but staring doggedly ahead into the turning white light of the hole in the wall .
‘ and i had to lose a good , good woman before i came to my sens .
but i did kick the drug , mr breakspear , and it wa probably the hardest damned thing i ever did in all my life .
but once i 'd done it , i swore i 'd help others do it . ’
‘ even the very rich ? ’
i asked provocatively .
‘ the rich trash pay the bill , mr breakspear , which let me give my spare time away to the poor trash . ’
i looked at the tough , impressive face .
‘ are the twin trash ? ’
he paused before replying , then gave the smallest shake of his head .
‘ she 's ok , but him ? ’
this time the pause wa almost eloquent , then he gave a richly contagious laugh .
‘ i 'd have liked to have had rickie crowninshield in my platoon for just five minute . ’
i laughed too .
‘ good to have you aboard . ’
‘ it ai n't bad being aboard , ’ he said , and held out his hand and , not before time , we shook .
by midnight i wa alone on deck , and happy to be alone .
i like sailing alone at night .
i like to watch the phosphorescence curling away from the hull and i like to watch the brilliant speck of light fade in the black deep water far in the ship 's wake .
i like to be alone under the careless profusion of the star , and alone on a moon-glossed sea .
i like the sound of a boat sailing at night .
the sound are the same a those of daylight , yet somehow the night magnifies and sharpens the creak of a yielding block , the sigh of air over a shroud , the stretching of a sail , the hiss of water sliding sleek against the hull , the curl of a quarter-wave falling away , and the thump a a wave strike the cutwater to be sheared into two bright slice of whiteness .
i like the purposefulness of a boat at night a it slit a path across an empty planet .
i like the secretiveness of a boat in the blackness , when the only thing to dislike is the prospect of dawn , which seems like a betrayal because , at night , in a boat under sail , it is easy to feel very close to god — for eternity is all around .
i tacked the ship shortly after midnight , doing the job by myself and enjoying the work .
ellen wa still awake , talking in the stateroom with rickie , but everyone else seemed asleep .
i wished that ellen and rickie would go to their bed , for the soft mutter of their voice wa an intrusion on the dark and star-studded infinity through which i steered wavebreaker .
the school framework
a model to link personality characteristic to a preference for science
john head
introduction
in recent year there ha been a steady accumulation of evidence that personality and allied affective factor play a crucial role in determining subject choice and student success .
unfortunately , this evidence ha tended to be fragmentary , a collection of separate , discrete piece of information lacking a synthesizing theory to provide cohesion and predictive power .
the few model which have been developed to date may have been correct a far a they go but are clearly incomplete .
for example roe ( 1952 ) , eiduson ( 1962 ) and mcclelland ( 1962 ) suggested that male scientist often experienced a lonely childhood , perhaps suffering social isolation through illness or family circumstance , so that they developed a strong interest in their surrounding material world and a below average interest in other people and relationship .
maslow ( 1966 ) and hudson ( 1966 and 1968 ) saw science a providing an emotionally undemanding activity appealing to boy moving from the calm of latency to the turbulence of adolescence .
even if these description are valid they still leave open a number of question , particularly why the same mechanism do not operate with girl .
arising from the evidence in the literature and from our empirical study at chelsea college it is now possible to offer a model which is compatible with all the evidence and which also ha considerable predictive potential .
what we know about person choosing science
the evidence for an association between personality characteristic and an interest in science ha been more fully reviewed by head ( 1979 ) .
we need now only take note of the most salient feature .
the most obvious one is that of sex difference .
the predominance of male , particularly in the physical science and engineering , throughout the western world can no longer be satisfactorily attributed to cognitive difference , which are too small , nor to institutional factor .
equal opportunity in education and employment ha not made science any more popular with woman .
furthermore , the characteristic of those student who do opt for science show clear sex difference .
male scientist , both science student and mature , professional scientist , tend to be emotionally reticent , disliking overt emotional expression in others and themselves , and depending upon their partner in personal relationship to take the emotional initiative .
they will also tend to be authoritarian , conservative and controlled in their thinking .
these difference can be seen quite early on ; we have found boy aged 14 year who were opting for science to be significantly more authoritarian than their peer .
girl choosing science are not particularly emotionally reticent or rigid in their thinking , although they do seem to have low self-esteem in term of being socially and sexually attractive .
we also know that at about the age of 13 a very high proportion of boy are attracted to science and scientific career .
thereafter , there is a steady decline of interest in science and this disillusionment extends right through the secondary-school year and into the undergraduate period .
in contrast , only a minority of girl express an interest in science at any age but there is no obvious swing from science in the middle and late teen .
some further evidence ha come from our use of sentence completion test with secondary-school pupil a part of our research programme at chelsea .
analysis of these response provides further information on sex difference and between those opting for different subject .
for example , girl at the age of 12 and 14 year seem to take a more mature attitude to personal relationship , seeing their complexity and reciprocal nature , while boy are more exploitative .
in relation to the sentence stem ‘ a girl and her mother … ’ , girl often produce response like ‘ often go through a bad patch for a year but once they learn to understand each other , become the best of friend ’ or ‘ can help each other with their problem ’ .
similar question , when asked of boy , tend to produce banal response or exploitative one , for example the parent is seen a the source of money .
in contrast , boy seem to have a firmer self-identity and a clearer ambition showing more insight in response to sentence stem such a ‘ my main problem is … ’ and ‘ he/she felt proud that … ’ .
such finding give u some clue about the characteristic of boy and girl of these age .
if we compare boy of 14 year of age who opt for science with other boy , we find that the former have very cut-and-dried view on many issue .
for example , they take the view that ‘ criminal should be severely punished ’ or that ‘ anyone who is unpopular deserves his fate ’ .
to the sentence stem ‘ when a child will not join in group activity … ’ , these boy gave response like ‘ he is selfish ’ , ‘ he must be stupid ’ , ‘ he deserves to be unpopular ’ .
in contrast , other boy and most girl pondered the possible cause and way of integrating the child into the group .
the science boy seemed to posse few doubt or uncertainty , they offered clear-cut answer .
it wa this evidence which suggested the possible model for subject choice in term of ego-identity achievement .
ego-identity in adolescence
this model wa originally postulated by erikson ( 1965 ) and then developed by marcia ( 1966 and 1976 ) .
erikson suggests that at different phase of life an individual face a particular psycho-social problem which need to be resolved before moving on to the next phase .
for adolescent the acquisition of a clear ego-identity is the crucial task .
at the beginning of adolescence , the individual is a within the family and the school .
by the end of adolescence he or she need to make choice about career , life-style , personal relationship and ideology .
the ego-identity of that person is shaped by these choice .
erikson doe not suggest that the development of an ego-identity is a once-and-for-all issue .
some problem about identity arise with the young child in the context of home and school , and others occur in later life , for example on retirement .
nevertheless , adolescence is the time when ego-identity development inevitably dominates the personal development of the individual for a while .
the adolescent doe not , however , need to achieve a clear ego-identity on all topic at one time .
he or she may have a clear identity in respect to his or her career but still be unresolved in regard to personal relationship and ideology .
in this article we are concerned with ego-identity achievement in respect to career .
marcia ha put more detail onto the erikson model and suggests that in going from the initial ego-diffusion condition to that of having achieved ego-identity , two process are involved : crisis and commitment .
crisis in this context describes a period of intensive self-examination in which one 's belief and value are re-examined .
commitment mean that the individual ha acquired clear and firm belief both about himself or herself and the world .
figure 16.1 indicates a number of possible route to ego-identity achievement .
a person may undergo crisis and commitment simultaneously and progress by route a. an alternative is to undergo a period of considerable self-doubt and self-examination in which all one 's belief tend to be very fluid , a period known a moratorium , before acquiring belief for oneself and ego-identity is achieved ( route b ) .
a further possibility is that the individual may , at least for a time , hold onto belief and value taken without question from others , for example parent , teacher , peer .
this condition is known a foreclosure .
eventually these person might have to face up to period of crisis , of self-examination , and so achieve ego-identity by route c. however , foreclosure doe offer an escape route and an individual might postpone indefinitely any real self-examination by clinging rigidly to his or her belief and value ( route d ) .
ego-identity and choosing science
we can now make the link between this model of adolescent development and subject choice in school .
for boy at the foreclosure stage , science is likely to be appealing .
the physical science in particular , offer a conventional career choice which is likely to win approval from parent , teacher and peer .
they will tend to regard the overt expression of emotion , including much such expression in the art , a being soft and feminine .
science , with it masculine image , make little emotional demand on an individual and seems to offer clear , precise answer to problem .
opting for science will permit and possibly reinforce emotional reticence .
for a girl at the foreclosure stage the situation is very different .
there is evidence that girl tend to be socialized into adult role more through their potential of becoming a mother and housewife than through their career ( douvan and adelson , 1966 ) .
furthermore , these girl will tend to go into a career with a feminine image , one which already attracts many girl .
consequently , very few girl at the foreclosure stage will enter science unless they receive considerable encouragement and a model to do so from their parent and their school .
neither boy nor girl at the moratorium stage are likely to be attracted to the science that is usually presented in our school .
they are at a stage when they are likely to be concerned with a variety of complex issue ; the meaning of life , the existence of god , ideology , their emerging sexuality , their future career and life-style — too often science is seen a being purely instrumental with nothing to contribute to these debate .
science , somehow , seems to be scarcely relevant to the most important issue in our life .
a proportion of both boy and girl at ego-identity achievement stage will choose science .
in fact , most girl entering science are probably at this stage a they will need some self-examination and sense of commitment to make this unconventional choice .
however , only a minority of adolescent will have reached the ego-identity achievement stage at the age when most pupil have to make crucial decision about subject choice at school .
this model seems to explain our observation .
a large number of boy , particularly at the foreclosure stage , are initially attracted to science but there is a drift away throughout later adolescence a they undergo some crisis .
the preponderance of boy at the foreclosure stage will yield the rigid , authoritarian attitude often associated with scientist .
the few girl who enter science will not usually show these foreclosure characteristic .
effect of curriculum change
the real use of this model linking personality development to subject choice is that it allows u to make prediction about how pupil might react to change in school science curriculum and school organization .
we can consider three possible change :
1
delaying subject choice : britain is unusual in asking pupil to make crucial choice about subject option in the 13–16 age range .
these decision can only be reversed with great difficulty .
what effect would delaying the choice make ?
in the development through the year of adolescence the number of foreclosure pupil will diminish , hence the recruitment of boy into science would be cut .
more boy and girl will have reached the ego-identity achievement stage and a proportion of these will go into science .
overall there would be a reduction in the number of student choosing science , but those who do so choose will be more likely to stay happily in the subject and to posse more flexible mind .
the quantitative loss would be met by a qualitative improvement .
2
giving science a more feminine image : it is sometimes argued that science textbook are sexist in showing illustration of boy , rather than girl , doing practical work in the laboratory , and so forth .
what effect would a deliberate attempt to change this image have ?
it might make it easier for girl at the foreclosure stage to accept science so recruitment might increase .
some of these girl might , however , drift away again when they reach their crisis period .
unless the change in image wa immense , boy would probably not be affected , science would still be an obvious , acceptable choice for a boy .
overall there would be some increase in the recruitment of girl , but no qualitative improvement .
3
emphasizing the application and relevance of science : to obtain a major qualitative improvement to recruitment in science with more girl and with student possessing imaginative , flexible mind it would be necessary to make science appealing to boy and girl at the moratorium stage .
in that event science must be seen to be relevant to the issue which concern them .
the probable implication is that science would need to be presented in the context of the need of society and individual .
probably a case-study approach involving the application of science , and the interaction with other discipline , would be needed .
our knowledge about the girl ' concern with personal relationship suggests that the introduction of some element of the social science into the case study might prove attractive .
is it possible to change school science in this fashion and still preserve the essential character of science itself ?
clearly there would need to be some drastic pruning of content .
perhaps science teacher should not attempt to cover their subject so comprehensively .
a history teacher is content to cover the history of one country or continent over a few decade .
perhaps we must make similar choice .
it is interesting to notice that the association for science education ( 1979 ) policy statement in britain and the proposal on school physic coming from the institute for science education ( ipn ) in kiel are advocating such change .
the difference is that we are now offering a formal psychological model to suggest that if we want to reduce the current encapsulation of science , if we want to recruit a different sort of student , then certain curriculum change are needed .
girl friendly science and the girl friendly school
judith whyte
approximately three time a many boy a girl take o level physic and approximately four time a many take cse physic .
over 90 per cent of entry in all technical subject are from boy .
this mean that schoolgirl are ineligible for a wide range of course in further and higher education and for entry to occupation requiring a scientific or technical base .
female exclusion from science and technology , even if it is apparently by girl ' own choice , also mean that a citizen their ability to understand and control their environment is limited .
nevertheless , most school consider they are already providing equal opportunity by neutral treatment of the two sex ( bloomfield , 1984 ) .
in effect , ignoring the effect of gender in this way merely reinforces stereotyping because it doe nothing to challenge the definition of certain aspect of the curriculum a masculine or feminine .
girl into science and technology ( gist ) wa the first major schools-based project addressing problem of sex stereotyping at school , and wa an example of ‘ action research ’ in education ; the project simultaneously took action to improve girl ' achievement in science and technology and investigated the reason for their under-achievement .
the project team collaborated with teacher in eight co-educational comprehensive school in the greater manchester area to devise and implement intervention strategy designed to improve girl ' attitude to the physical science and technical subject .
two other school were involved a control where attitude testing but no intervention took place . …
the approach wa collaborative : teacher were invited to work with the team a equal partner in the attempt both to investigate and find solution to the gist problem .
however , very few of the teacher even recognized the issue a one of professional concern at the start of the project , and most of the first two year wa spent in establishing the educational importance of the issue and working towards the development of feasible intervention strategy .
the project and it outcome have been fully described elsewhere ( smail et al . ,
1982 ; kelly , whyte and smail , 1984 ; whyte in press ) .
gist had more success in altering child 's attitude than their subject choice , suggesting that it is easier to change attitude and belief than actual behaviour .
pupil in action school became markedly le stereotyped than pupil in control school .
they also had slightly more positive attitude towards science and scientist and were le likely to define them a exclusively masculine .
despite some evidence of change in teacher ' attitude and behaviour , they themselves were reluctant to admit that the project had influenced them .
according to an evaluation report this may reflect an unwillingness to admit that in the past school have been sex biased ( payne , cuff and hustler , 1984 ) .
the gist hypothesis wa that female under-achievement in science and technology is at least partly socially constructed by the school , an hypothesis based on research evidence a well a critical feminist analysis ( see , for example , kelly , 1981 ) .
during the project there wa a shift away from locating the issue a one of girl ' motivation towards attempt to change the nature of school science .
one of the main gain from the gist project ha been the clarification of what is meant by a ‘ girl friendly ’ , science , that is a science which will appeal equally to the interest and concern of girl a well a boy . …
making science more girl friendly
several intervention were designed to make science more girl friendly .
school and teacher tried curriculum development to build on girl ' science interest , changing pattern of classroom interaction , single sex group and class .
the largest scale intervention wa the vista programme , which consisted of woman scientist and technologist visiting school to talk to child about an aspect of their job already being covered in the school science syllabus .
vista made science more girl friendly in two way : both boy and girl were offered an attractive image of a competent woman scientist , and talk concentrated on social and industrial application of science , an element too often missing from science at school .
one school wa so impressed by the child 's positive reaction that they completely revamped the science work in the first two year to include more social and human application of science .
the survey of child 's attitude helped here : research such a ormerod 's ( 1971 ; ormerod and duckworth , 1975 ) had shown that girl were interested in the social implication of science , but did not tell teacher what the desirable teaching approach might be in practice .
would science in the home be a starter ?
a question from our survey asked child whether they would like to know more about how a vacuum cleaner work ; hardly anyone did , and girl were even le curious than boy .
this told u that any simplistic assumption about featuring ‘ female ’ domestic interest in science would probably meet with failure .
the rest of the questionnaire about science curiosity showed that all the child were enthusiastic about learning science , and that girl were keen to know more about nature , the environment and medical science .
over 50 per cent , and in some case over 60 per cent said they would like to learn about the human heart , germ and illness , how our muscle work , what food is good for you , life in the sea , what make a rainbow appear and how a record is made .
it wa helpful that these topic also interested boy .
at present the science curriculum is structured around physical science interest , on which boy are keener ( how motor car work , atom and molecule ) ; we were able to recommend that teaching build on the overlapping interest of the two sex , because girl a well a boy want to know more about human biology and spectacular feature of the environment ( animal in the jungle , volcano and earthquake , acid and chemical ) .
the le immediately attractive part of science could be approached through these interest , for instance teaching ‘ force ’ by beginning with the action of muscle in the human arm , and ‘ light ’ via the dissection of a bull 's eye .
when woman scientist employ such approach , and describe their own work , a happened during the vista programme , girl are receiving double encouragement .
these example indicate some of the feature of girl friendly science : it build on girl ' interest , not just boy ' ; it explicitly encourages girl to see themselves a potential scientist , and it includes some of the social and human implication and application of science .
other gist intervention
all the gist school were mixed comprehensive , and at first teacher were most unwilling to separate boy and girl at all , on the ground that it ran counter to their co-educational comprehensive philosophy .
then certain teacher were particularly struck by the evidence of large difference in the interest and experience child brought with them to school .
girl had far le ‘ tinkering ’ experience than boy and the connection with their lesser interest in topic like ‘ how electricity is produced ’ seemed obvious .
several special science or craft club were organized in the lunch hour for girl only and in two school teacher planned single-sex teaching .
a we shall see , it wa in these two school that the largest measurable change of attitude and option choice occurred .
for a more girl friendly science , it seems vital that teacher should come to see that when all the masculine packaging , evident in textbook and resource a well a teacher ' and boy ' behaviour in the classroom , is removed , girl can be very enthusiastic about science . …
alison kelly see at least four distinct sens in which it can be argued that science is masculine .
first , the pupil , teacher and practitioner of science are overwhelmingly male in term of number ; second , school science is packaged and presented to appeal to boy , not girl ; third , classroom behaviour and interaction operate to reconstruct science a a male activity , and finally it ha been suggested that ‘ scientific ’ thinking embodies an intrinsically masculine world view .
the gist intervention described above relate to three of these : vista woman , albeit briefly and temporarily , redressed the numerical balance by offering female role model of practising scientist ; vista and the curriculum development which followed involved a limited ‘ repackaging ’ of science to remove it exclusively masculine appeal , and the single-sex class and classroom observation showed how science come to be defined a ‘ masculine ’ in the mixed school .
the fourth point , the idea that science is intrinsically masculine , can be sustained only by clinging to an irredeemably narrow conception of science and scientific thinking .
the industrial and social impact of science on health , on people , on the environment , a focus on the beauty and complexity of the natural world , are notable omission from the school science syllabus .
girl are not uninterested in science , they are bored by the limited version of it they meet in school .
one of the purpose of an extended period of single-sex science teaching might be to let teacher see how girl approach scientific matter , and to discover , what may well be the case , that girl are just a capable of ‘ scientific thinking ’ a boy .
margaret spear , in a different study from the one reported in this volume , found that for identical work boy were marked higher than girl for supposed understanding of principle , aptitude for science and o level suitability ( spear , 1984 ) .
ii the first critique
unity had been easy during the resistance , because relationship were almost always man-to-man .
over against the german army or the vichy government , where social generality ruled , a it doe in all machine of state , the resistance offered the rare phenomenon of historical action which remained personal .
the psychological and moral element of political action were almost the only one to appear here , which is why intellectual least inclined to politics were to be seen in the resistance .
the resistance wa a unique experience for them , and they wanted to preserve it experience in the new french politics because this experience broke away from the famous dilemma of being and doing , which confronts all intellectual in the face of action … .
it is only too obvious that this balance between action and personal life wa intimately bound up with the condition of clandestine action and could not survive it .
and in this sense it must be said that the resistance experience , by making u believe that politics is a relationship between man and man or between consciousness , fostered our illusion of 1939 and masked the truth of the incredible power of history which the occupation taught u in another connection .
if by 1945 merleau-ponty had here already indicated the historical basis for what wa to become sartre 's project in the critique , the theoretical problem that followed wa how to unite orthodox marxist concept of economic determinism and historical necessity with the individualism of sartre 's earlier work , that is the existentialist notion of the authentic self and the possibility of choosing one 's own freedom : how to relocate human practice within historical determinism , to reconcile the individual with the social , the idea of agency with that of necessity , or freedom with history ?
for marxist or hegelian thought , such an age-old contradiction ought to be resolvable through the operation of dialectical logic .
citing marx 's famous remark in the eighteenth brumaire , ‘ men make their own history … but under circumstance … given and transmitted from the past ’ , sartre suggested that this implied ‘ the permanent and dialectical unity of freedom and necessity , ( i , 35 ) .
accordingly , he attempted to shift marxism away from orthodox theory of an absolute determinism towards the primacy of a concept of ‘ history ’ which , while still a totality a it had been for lukács , a process with a determinate meaning and end , could also include a concept of human agency and thus articulate the individual with the social , freedom with determinism .
today , sartre 's voluntarism is to some extent returning to favour a the result of a desire to retrieve the category of agency and the subject , which go together with the wish to get out of the apparently totalizing system of adorno , althusser or foucault .
sartre 's stress on the role of the subject also find approval because many of those no longer prepared to argue for a general theory of history a the progress of a single narrative of class-struggle , have begun to argue instead for a return of it correlative , the subject , almost a if it wa the next best thing in the absence of history itself .
but it still leaf u with the crucial problem that sartre had to solve , namely how to link human consciousness with the process of history so that the former can be said to be the agent of the latter .
how could this take place ?
a sartre had put it in what is literature ? :
‘ never ha homo faber better understood that he ha made history and never ha he felt so powerless before history ’ .
how can man make history if at the same time it is history which make him ?
sartre considered that orthodox dialectical materialism take the easy way out by merely eliminating the first in favour of the second , making man a passive product entirely determined by economic circumstance .
unwilling to follow merleau-ponty by dropping the second in favour of the first , sartre argued that it wa possible for man to be both at once through the movement of praxis , that is intentional action which produce material effect .
it corollary , whereby praxis becomes determining history , he called the ‘ practico-inert ’ , by which he meant the material circumstance that have themselves been created by previous praxis and which form the condition for new praxis .
the individual is thus both totalizer and totalized , deftly uniting freedom with necessity .
though this neatly solves the problem of how man can make history while at the same time history make him , it doe not answer the larger question of how a multiplicity of the product of individual act , ‘ totalizations ’ , can themselves be totalized into the overall totalization required by the logic of dialectical rationality — rather than being the arbitrary , blind and self-cancelling movement of , say , hardy 's immanent will .
sartre 's fundamental thesis , that ‘ history continually effect totalisations of totalisations ’ ( i , 15 ) , doe not in itself answer what ronald aronson ha rightly characterized a the question for sartre : ‘ how do separate , antagonistic action yield a history ; how do individual totalizations lead to totalization ( and also progress , the direction of history , it truth and it meaning ) ? ’
for the whole basis of sartre 's argument is that the dialectic of history is not a metaphysical law , ‘ some powerful unitary force revealing itself behind history like the will of god ’ , but the continuously produced effect of individual conflict ; each action is in it turn subsumed a a part of the whole in an ever broader , developing totalization ( i , 37 ) .
what sartre need to demonstrate , therefore , is that if the law of the dialectic work from the individual level , overall it produce nothing le than the intelligibility or the meaning of history a such :
the dialectic is the law of totalization which creates several collectivities , several society , and one history — reality , that is , which impose themselves on individual ; but at the same time it must be woven out of million of individual action .
we must show that it is possible for it to be both a resultant … and a totalizing force … how it can continually bring about the unity of dispersive profusion and integration .
( i , 36 )
but what produce the overall direction of history ?
how doe it ‘ continually bring about the unity of dispersive profusion and integration ’ ?
sartre doe not attempt to answer this question , shifting rather to the notion of a lack of self-consciousness .
the dialectic is the law that remains hidden .
at the moment , ‘ history is made without being known ( l'histoire se fait sans se connâitre ) ’ — history constitutes , we might say today , a political unconscious .
‘ marxism ’ , on the other hand , sartre claim , ‘ is history itself becoming conscious of itself ’ ( i , 40 ) : a for lukács , it is by becoming conscious of itself a the subject of history that the working class will understand history 's meaning — and so recognize itself a the meaning of history .
while he suggests in apocalyptic tone in the problem of method that this process of self-consciousness is at last beginning to take place , and that civil , foreign and colonial war are becoming apparent a different form of a single class struggle , sartre also admits that the divorce between theory and praxis which ensued under stalinism ha generally prevented any clear self-consciousness among the mass .
the ‘ detour , of stalinism is thus formalized a marxism 's own descent into it unconscious , resulting in a dream-work of heterogeneous history that have eluded systematization and subsumption into the single meaning of marxism 's own reading of history .
it is therefore , sartre argues , our historical task to make it known , promoting not just the historical process a such , but also the general recognition whereby the plurality of the meaning of individual history can be seen to combine to make one history , with one meaning — the ‘ truth of humanity ’ ( i , 822 ) .
sartre 's account thus set up the articulation of history , univocal meaning , and totality a the indissoluble set of element required for the validation of marxism , necessary in order to save it from it detour from itself .
the problem , however , remains how such universal are produced from the multiplicity of initiating individual praxis .
if history is a history of conflict , how could it be both one and internally diversified without the inner moving principle of the dialectic ?
how can history be a unity if it is also conflictual , if each action is aimed at destroying the other and result in a double negation in which the original aim of each action have been destroyed by the other ?
if each action negates the aim of the other , where is the ‘ unity ’ totalized in the conflict ?
how doe history constantly totalize itself ?
( i , 817 — 18 ) sartre arrives at what he call ‘ the real problem of history ’ , that is how there can be totalization without a totalizer , only at the very end of volume i. it is not until the next volume , however , that he intends to show how individual action , separate multiplicity , make up ‘ one human history , with one truth and one intelligibility ’ ( i , 69 ) .
throughout , sartre ha nevertheless taken it ‘ for granted that such a totalisation is constantly developing both a history and a historical truth ’ ( i , 822 ) .
his history , therefore , is always in process : but it teleology of a final totalization always ha to be assumed .
he thus asserts the truth of history while constantly projecting forward and deferring it proof .
but when the proof come it also turn out to rest on the assumption that it is already true .
iii the second critique :
‘ we are trying to establish the truth of history'
sartre produce a persuasive formulation of the relation of the individual to the determining historical circumstance through his concept of praxis and the practico-inert ; it is also obvious to him how the larger question of history ought to be solved .
he asserts it often enough : ‘ history continually effect totalisations of totalisations , ( i , 15 ) .
but in volume i of the critique , a we have seen , he continually defers the demonstration of his proof .
for the ‘ dogmatic dialectic ’ , a he describes dialectical materialism , the whole question naturally pose no problem , for each person or group simply constitutes a partial moment of an already operative movement of totalization that produce them and then go beyond them .
but sartre 's dispensing with all historicist schema creates the problem of how , between two autonomous and contradictory totalizations , there could be ‘ one dialectical intelligibility of the ongoing process ’ ( ii , 13 ) .
he attempt to solve this through matching his account of contradiction with a new concept derived from the conjunction of work and labour : ‘ anti-labour ’ ( anti-travail ) , a category of negation .
the product of a conflict , a well a it residue , may seem incomprehensible insofar a they differ from the original intention of any of the combatant .
nevertheless they constitute the basis and condition for further action and history .
dialectical reason encounter such product a undecidables :
aporias — because they seem to be at once the result of a communal enterprise while at the same time bearing witness to the fact that this enterprise never existed except a the inhuman reverse side of two opposed action in which each aim to destroy the other .
in the dialectical perspective , we encounter these object a production which are human and provided with a future … thus they seem by themselves to be totalizations in process .
( ii , 20 )
this mean that first , they lead to result , and second , that the internal structure of social object contains ‘ the double negation of themselves and of each constituent part by the other ’ ( ii , 22 ) .
there is , therefore , before any understanding of historic agent and movement , a certain aporia in all social ensemble : from afar they may appear whole , but close to , they can be seen a riddled with hole .
this increasingly come to resemble nothing so much a sartre 's own account of history .
in the context of the negativity of this formulation , sartre is obliged to pose once again the problem of whether there can be a totalization , without any independent totalizer or totalizing force such a the dialectic , or whether the structure of negation that he ha described mean that , a for adorno or bakhtin , history doe not develop positively but , rather , negatively , and is therefore instead detotalizing :
marxism is rigorously true if history is totalization ; it is not so any more if human history decomposes into a plurality of particular history , or if , in any case , within the relationship of immanence that characterizes struggle , the negation of each adversary by the other is on principle detotalizing .
certainly , we have neither the design nor the actual possibility of showing here the full truth of dialectical materialism …
our goal is solely to establish whether , in a practical ensemble torn apart by antagonism ( whether there are multiple conflict or whether they are reduced to one ) the break themselves are totalizing and carried along by the totalizing movement of the ensemble .
( ii , 25 )
at this point sartre confronts the possibility that the whole project of the critique , stated so confidently on it very first page — ‘ it must be proved that a negation of a negation can be an affirmation ’ ( i , 15 ) — may break down .
perhaps the truth of history can not be proved ; it direction can not be discerned .
sartre 's reaction to the threat that the negation of a negation may produce a detotalizing effect is to introduce a new category , a unifying force of a ‘ singularization ’ which incarnates the universal : ‘ if totalization really is an ongoing process ’ , he writes , ‘ then it operates everywhere .
that mean both that there is a dialectical meaning of the practical ensemble … and that each singular event totalizes in itself the practical ensemble in the infinite richness of it singularity ’ ( ii , 26 ) .
unlike lukács ' insignificant event from which the universal is precariously drawn out through the narrative , sartre 's singularity work synecdochally in a conventional antinomy with the universal , the relation between the two structured according to the familiar nineteenth-century model of organic growth or process in which each singular event make up the whole while , a he put it , ‘ the whole is entirely present in the part a it present meaning and a it destiny ’ .
sartre 's ‘ singular universal ’ , therefore , begs the question , for it is predicated on the assumption that , if there is not a totality a such , then there already is an overall totalization : ‘ if totalization really is an ongoing process … ’ .
that developing process is itself totalized through sartre 's assertion that each totalization is the totalization of all struggle , a it must be if the singular is to incarnate the universal .
the concept of the singular universal thus facilitates a circularity in the argument whereby sartre can avoid the question which he began by posing .
so the singular universal presumes the totalization he ca n't ( yet ) prove .
this strategy mark a structure of repetition in sartre 's text : each time he pose the question of how there can be totalization of history without a totalizer , he retreat to a more limited example whose unity is already evident , but which in the end only brings him back to the original question again .
in this case sartre demonstrates how the singular universal work , by appealing to the concrete example of a boxing match — a random exemplification that just happens to reproduce the single adversary of the master/slave dialectic .
it totalization take place through it incarnation , a part of the totality of boxing , in the overall framework within which each individual fight occurs .
each boxing match , sartre claim , must be both a unique event and also in some sense the incarnation of all boxing , whose rule and convention it follows , and whose past and future history it set itself against .
but it is also apparent that that totality is not completely known , nor is it future shape even presumed .
by totalization , therefore , sartre doe not here mean anything like a predetermined end or final closure of a totality but rather a process of mediation among the part , where each is determined by the other .
no one can predict the future of boxing , either at the level of particular victory or defeat , in effect a structure of repetition , nor at the more general level of possible modification or development of the sport .
yet each individual bout articulates itself within the framework of the history of boxing , known and unknown .
this allows sartre to include chance and contingency in his scheme .
since it can not be known a a concept that will realize itself in the future , sartre argues instead that the totality only produce itself in the moment : ‘ the incarnation a such is at once unrealizable except a totalization of everything and irreducible to a pure abstract unity of that which it totalizes ’ ( ii , 58 ) .
the universal , the totality , can only be known through the singular .
but it future direction remains unknown and indeterminate .
at the same time sartre make a larger , though le persuasive claim that the boxing-match also work synecdochally and re-exteriorizes a more fundamental violence , namely the interiorized condition of scarcity that he considers to be the basis of conflict in general .
the boxing match ‘ is the public incarnation of all conflict ’ ( ii , 32 ) , totalizing in it own struggle the whole of ‘ contemporary irreducibilities and fissure ’ ( ii , 26 ) :
thus one can and must say … that each fight is the singularisation of all the circumstance of the social whole in movement and that by this singularisation , it incarnates the enveloping totalization which the historical process is .
( ii , 58 )
but then he add , ‘ i have said and i repeat that we have not yet proved that this enveloping totalization exists ’ .
so , although it is possible to conceive of any event a an incarnation of the totality , insofar a it must itself make up a part of that totality in it determination , unlike the case of the boxing match , where we can define the overall entity ‘ boxing ’ , it still remains unproven that an overall entity , ‘ history ’ , can be said to exist at all .
for all his use of the model of the boxing match , sartre ha really got no further with the fundamental question of how there can be totalization without a totalizer .
it is simple enough for him to show that a boxing match take place within a general totality of ‘ boxing ’ , which is itself only ever present in any individual incarnation , for a a game each match is both an individual bout and something conducted according to general rule and a specific social tradition .
but what about those conflict that do not take place within such a constituted social system , such a conflictual bourgeois society which can not be said to be unified , except , a sartre suggests dismissively , by appeal to a lost paradise before the class struggle ?
such society make the conflict of history irreducible to sartre 's logic unless , like the boxing match , they can be shown to take part in a larger totalizable category .
however , when he pose the question of whether his method could work a well for the class struggle a for the boxing match , sartre admits that he find it impossible to answer and return instead to the much easier case of sub-groups .
once again he backtracks and assumes a larger unity in which conflict take place .
the major question thus always remains unanswered in the critique : every time that sartre announces that he is about to proceed with the fundamental problem of how history can be a totalization without a totalizer , he turn back to a previous , more easily intelligible stage on the way .
his difficulty is accompanied by a no doubt symptomatic increasing distrust of universal so that , in championing specificity against them , he seems to give up the attempt to validate the universal — history a totalization — that originally formed the object of his project .
at this point a further contradiction in sartre 's whole enterprise begin to open up : for someone so deeply distrustful of universal it seems curious that he ha involved himself so emphatically with the notion of totality , history , and the dialectic .
a sartre insists more and more upon the virtue of specificity ( ii , 200 — 05 ) , such is his distaste for marxist or any other universalizing category that he refuse even to countenance them , attempting to replace concept with specificity , universal with singular .
his scepticism go to the extent of even denying the existence of ‘ society ’ or ‘ the nation ’ a such ( ii , 24 , 61 ) — the very totality which his own general argument for totalization requires .
here certain similarity with later ‘ post-marxist ’ theorist such a foucault or lyotard , begin to become apparent .
but if sartre anticipates such later thinker we should not assume too quickly that they have simply taken his insight further .
for sartre 's singular universal could never be expected to solve the formal theoretical problem of how individual existential existence can be related to history insofar a it simply renames , in one oxymoronic category , the original antithetical term .
without an adequate theory of their articulation , they simply begin to separate again .

the philosopher 's child
judith hughes
some of our child are missing
child have served philosophy very well .
that is the first thing which anyone surveying the literature would notice .
along with a selection from a list including woman , animal , madman , foreigner , slave , patient and imbecile , child have served in that great class of being , the ‘ not-men ’ , in contrast with which male philosopher have defined and valued themselves .
unlike the others who appear and disappear a fashion and progress dictate , child occupy a permanent place in the list partly because of their continuing presence a a potential sub-class , partly because they have never protested and mainly because it is assumed that in favourable circumstance they will become men and therefore require attention .
they have received it in the shape of detailed educational theory carefully worked out to see them through the maturation process from infancy to adulthood .
generation of philosopher have documented this process .
perhaps the best known version is shakespeare 's seven age of man which is a poetic statement of what had already been received wisdom for century and wa to remain so for century to come .
education wa to guide the infant through the transition to manhood including such stage a childhood , boyhood and youth .
that is the second thing to notice ; the philosopher 's child are boy .
the fact that at least half of the world 's child would not actually go through this process beyond the first two stage is conveniently forgotten or ignored and , no doubt , the reason for this were largely social .
but the neglect of girl child through the century of theorising is more than a social injustice , though many might think this real and bad enough .
education ha an end .
although it is fashionable to talk about it value ‘ for it own sake ’ , what prompt the theorising is the strong and well-founded belief that the experience of childhood affect the kind of adult which the child turn out to be .
where the end is person- rather than role-oriented — that is , where the end is the development of the human mind and spirit rather than the production of , say , information technologist — then education is valued in relation to some conception of worthwhile human existence which it is meant to serve .
such an ideal doe not stand isolated from the practice which strive towards it but interacts with those practice , help to construct them , and is in turn constructed by them .
the great philosopher have always produced such a person-oriented account at least for those whose education wa thought to matter .
education ha been directed at the production of the rational , the free , the independent of mind , the dignified , in short , the autonomous human being .
yet because the philosopher 's adult ha traditionally been male , his child boy child , and his educational programme designed to facilitate the transition between them , the ideal of the fully human person ha been masculinised to the point where otherwise thoughtful and sometimes good and wise men have unashamedly admitted that this defining ideal is not applicable to half the specie .
rationality turn into narrow intellectualism , freedom into licence , independence into isolationism , dignity into selfish pride ; the autonomous human being turn out to be no more than a social atom after all .
the degeneration occurs , not because men are congenitally or even incorrigibly narrow , libertine , isolated or selfish , but because in defining themselves a autonomous being in opposition to other human being they have had to seek what separate them a a group from others .
it is a curiously paradoxical foundation uponupon which to build a theory of autonomy .
moral autonomy is concerned with individual not with group ; a conception of autonomy which depends upon group membership display it own contradiction .
this paper is partly about the rejection of certain account of autonomy though not with the rejection of the ideal of autonomy itself .
it is also about child .
woman philosopher and girl child
why should woman in general and woman philosopher in particular be specially interested in the nature and status of child ?
there are , of course , the familiar and obvious reason connected with woman 's traditional role in child-rearing but there are le obvious reason too .
when philosopher dismiss woman a ‘ not-men ’ they frequently do more than simply lump them together with child or lunatic .
explicitly or implicitly the suggestion is that woman are child or lunatic or whichever other company they keep .
it would be well to know just what this entail .
schopenhauer said that woman remain big child all their life ; it would be interesting to know what he thought child were like .
a common result of this is that when the philosopher deny autonomy to woman , they do so for the same sort of reason that they deny it to child and cite lack of rationality , capriciousness and vulnerability among their characteristic .
we can do more than to reject such description of ourselves ; we can ask further question : are child like this ? is this why child are not autonomous ?
again , woman well know what it is like to be treated a child and they find it offensive .
it would therefore be reasonable to consider whether child find it offensive to be treated like child .
is being treated a a child an intrinsically humiliating and self-denying experience ?
what is it to be treated a a child ?
woman philosopher are in a special position to consider such question for in the image of the philosopher 's child they see themselves .
it is no accident that the liberation of woman , such a it is , should form part of a wider movement of liberation in general ; liberation for one part of the ‘ not-men ’ is bound to have a knock-on effect when your fellow group are sometimes quite literally identified with you .
the assumption that all group in the ‘ not-men ’ class are identical with each other is so firmly rooted that , a we shall see in the fourth section , it is readily assumed even by modern libertarian thinker that showing that , for example , some ground for distinguishing between men and woman is false or irrelevant , immediately commits u to the view that the same ground is irrelevant in distinguishing men from child .
‘ that 's what they used to say about woman ’ is not a proof that saying it about a child is false .
but it should make u very suspicious .
that when woman are given the vote it follows that child should be given it too is no argument at all , but a version of it occurs in modern debate over the justice or injustice of mill 's famous disclaimer in his essay on liberty .
having denied that we may ever legitimately interfere with the liberty of another except on the ground of self-protection , mill ( 1910 ) asserts :
this principle is meant to apply only to human being in the maturity of their faculty .
we are not speaking of child or of young person below the age which the law may fix a that of manhood or womanhood .
those who are still in a state to require being taken care of by others must be protected against their own action a well a against external injury .
( p.73 )
this view , a we shall see , ha been attacked on the ground that it rest on the false assumption that the distinction between adult and child is identical with the distinction between rational and non-rational being .
the attack are based on empirical observation ; most woman and older child are actually quite a rational a most men while some men are actually le rational .
if we agree that in that case woman should be embraced by the liberty principle then so should child .
i shall suggest that this doe not follow because rationality is not in fact the ground for the distinction in the first place .
partly to redress the balance and partly because talking about ‘ child ’ cover such a wide range of potential image , i shall try to keep before my mind an ordinary 10-year-old of our society .
she is the child of this paper unless i indicate otherwise .
throughout we should ask ourselves , doe this ( whatever is being said ) apply to her ?
first of all , let u remind ourselves of the traditional picture of child drawn for u by some great philosopher of the past .
one thing they are all quite sure about is that child are not like adult ; in particular they agree that child lack some capacity for rational thought which adult have .
now we are 6 — or 10 — or 18 … .
the slave ha absolutely no deliberative faculty ; the woman ha but it authority is imperfect ; so ha the child , but in this case it is immature .
( aristotle , 1959,1260a )
child … are not endued with reason at all , till they have attained the use of speech but are called reasonable creature for the possibility apparent of having the use of reason in time to come .
( hobbes , 1914 , p. 21 )
child … love to be treated a rational creature sooner than is imagined … by which …
i mean , that you should make them sensible by the mildness of your carriage , and the composure even in your correction of them , that what you do is reasonable in you and useful and necessary for them .
( locke , 1968 , p. 181 )
in training for youth , the child must be given reason ; in the training of the infant for childhood this can not be done .
young child ought merely to have thing shown to them a they are , or they get puzzled and ask question after question .
but a we approach the age of youth reason appears .
at what age ought the education for youth to begin ?
roughly at the age of ten year , when by nature the child enters the stage of youth and begin to reflect …
the youth … is capable of having principle ; his religious and moral idea can be cultivated , and he is able to attend to his own refinement .
( kant , 1930 , pp. 250–1 )
if a society let any considerable number of it member grow up mere child , incapable of being acted on by rational consideration of distant motif , society ha itself to blame for the consequence .
( mill , 1910 , p. 139 )
what are the philosopher ' child like ?
they have an ‘ immature ’ deliberative faculty ( aristotle ) , are not ‘ endued with reason ’ ( hobbes ) , until roughly the age of 10 ( kant ) and are ‘ incapable of being acted upon by rational consideration of distant motif ’ ( mill ) .
but they are not completely lost cause .
the immature deliberative faculty will mature ; child have the ‘ possibility apparent ’ of turning into rational being ( hobbes ) ; they love to be reated a though they were rational though they are not so yet ( locke ) ; you can give the prerational child reason for acting in certain way and he will turn into the youth who is capable of having principle ( kant ) .
until the time when these thing happen then mill 's disclaimer come into operation .
child must be taken care of by others and protected from external injury and against their own action .
the traditional view is encapsulated in the claim that child are not autonomous ; that is , on a standard interpretation , they lack the capacity to act rationally in pursuit of their own self-chosen goal .
it is then a matter of preference whether you say that they can not choose the goal or that they can not form strategy to achieve them or both .
in either case , the political implication is that denying right to child is entirely justified , and there the matter rest .
in all this , there are perhaps a couple of thing which look plausible when we compare the philosopher 's child with our mental picture ; aristotle 's observation that child are immature and mill 's suggestion that they might need protection .
beyond that , the similarity seem remote .
there is obviously something wrong with a portrayal of child a totally lacking in reason until they leap out of bed on their tenth birthday announcing that they are now able to act on principle .
apart from being false , such an account leaf no room in our thinking about child for thing like teaching and learning , or development in understanding and character and all those other concept which refer to process and not to state .
the tension between these theoretical view of child a non-rational , non-autonomous being and the practical knowledge of real child is evident in those quotation from hobbes and locke and kant and mill .
child , according to hobbes , have the ‘ possibility apparent ’ of becoming reasonable .
in what doe the possibility consist ?
hobbes is not using an inductive argument here ; the ‘ possibility apparent ’ is not an inductive argument from observation about past child but is meant to refer to some discernible feature of present one .
but what ?
hobbes doe not tell u , but whatever it is it had better be something which a monkey doe not have .
it is not language since hobbes is here talking about the prelinguistic child .
perhaps it consists in the ability to respond intelligently to the language of others .
but then , either hobbes ha failed to distinguish the child from at least the higher and domesticated animal or the force of ‘ intelligently ’ must be explained in such a way a to exclude animal .
in any case , if such a qualification is called for it is hard to see how a creature with no rationality at all could posse it .
locke 's remark are just a puzzling .
child are definitely not rational but love to be treated a if they were .
how is this possible ?
apparently they like having thing explained to them without understanding either the explanation or even what an explanation is .
perhaps he just mean that they like the sound of my voice ?
well , maybe they do , but making any old noise is clearly not sufficient to enter the rationality stake ; i must at least say something .
is it just that i talk to them that they love ?
maybe , but i can also , if i like , talk to my car , but yelling at it in the approved basil fawlty manner is hardly treating it a rational .
lockean child have the added amazing ability to recognise reason in you without possessing any themselves , while kantian kid , two stage back from rationality , have the disconcerting habit of getting puzzled and asking question .
mill 's minor are a little more complicated .
part of the time he see them in the familiar way a creature who lack rationality to at least some degree .
but in the disclaimer his child need above all to be protected from the ghastly consequence of their own action .
their problem seems to be not one of the inability to choose goal or to form strategy for achieving them , but an incorrigible propensity to choose the wrong one and an awesome efficiency in achieving them unless adult intervene .
all in all , it is a pretty unconvincing picture .
if you say that child are completely non-rational then you have to account for the fact that they become rational , and to do that it appears from these example that you have to assume that they already are .
if , on the other hand , you allow rationality to child , then you can not use their lack of it a a criterion to distinguish them from adult .
hobbes et al .
are not aware of the unreality of their original picture which is why , often in the same sentence , they produce these contradiction .
the one thing they do not do is to re-examine the original for the tell-tale sign of forgery .
illegitimate inference
the recognition that child can not simply be written off in the rationality stake and can not therefore be denied autonomy on this account ha led some writer to conclude that they can not , therefore , be denied it on any account .
we should notice that this view is not just a flight of fancy from the loony left , the pederast lobby or child themselves .
it is also to be found in stronger or weaker version of more cautious academic thought .
in escape from childhood ( 1974 ) , john holt note that child are , in fact , capable of a great deal more than modern society allows them to be .
he see childhood a a fairly modern invention designed to fit adult rather than child 's need , and an oppressive invention at that .
he suggests that child should be given a comprehensive range of civil and legal right including the right to vote , to manage their own financial affair , to direct and manage their own education and to control their own sex life and
to make and enter into , on a basis of mutual consent , quasifamilial relationship outside one 's immediate family — i.e. the right to seek and choose guardian other than one 's own parent and to be legally dependent on them .
( holt , 1974 , p. 16 )
this is also the view put forward by john harris , though in le specific term .
like holt , harris belief that the so-called incompetence of child is an adult invention imposed on child for adult ' convenience .
he make a firm proposal that the age of majority should be gradually reduced to 10 year , and remark :
we must remember that to deny someone control of their own life is to offer them a most profound insult , not to mention the which the frustration of their wish and the setting at naught of their own plan for themselves will add .
perhaps we should conduct annual examination from an early age to be sure that we do a little of this sort of damage a possible ?
( harris , 1982 , p. 49 )
now holt and harris both have many wise , enlightened and humane observation to make about some of the injustice which we inflict upon child , but a these remark show , putting them right without inflicting equally grave injustice is no easy matter .
both of them appear to suffer from a form of mental myopia in imagining the consequence of such proposal , and i am not here referring only to mill-type consequence of harm brought about by unwise decision .
what , we may ask holt , happens to the child who , dissatisfied at home , seek in vain for guardian who would suit him ?
what if no one want him ?
our paper are currently full of ‘ hard-to-place ’ child in local authority care advertising for foster or adoptive parent .
in such a situation the skilled care of social worker is crucial to ensuring that an unwanted by-product of success for some child is not the total destruction of self-esteem for others .
what , we may ask harris , happens to the child who repeatedly fails his annual examination ?
to impose such a test on child would be a particularly invidious way of discriminating against them , unless harris ha in mind that we should all undergo such examination .
he might then be open to bitter objection from many adult .
these two suggestion , far from being enlightened liberation of all child , are actually oppression of a deeply damaging kind to at least some , and harris 's suggestion contains a capacity criterion in disguise .
in any case , it would be dishonest to pretend that mill-type consequence are not relevant here .
suppose holt 's 6-year-old doe opt out of school ?
what happens to her then ?
what happens if her father is unwilling or unable to stay at home with her ?
is it any better to oblige her to go abseiling or butterfly-catching instead ?
however much she may enjoy such pursuit , there will be time when she would actually rather wander the street unaccompanied .
given that holt is presumably not volunteering himself to take care of her , who will ?
his view that letting child run in and out of busy airport smartly avoiding the traffic is perfectly reasonable depends upon a conception of a child which is far narrower than even the sex divide .
holt 's child is actually the artful dodger ; mercifully , not all child are .
there are other difficulty too .
it is not clear whether or not harris think that child of 10 should be obliged to take on full political status whether or not they want to , but holt clearly doe not .
he proposes that ‘ the right , privilege , duty , responsibility of adult citizen be made available to any young person , of whatever age , who want to make use of them ’ ( holt , 1974 , p. 15 ) .
if holt think that this proposal would remove an arbitrary boundary line between adult and child , then he is mistaken .
the point about an adult citizen is that he ha these right , privilege , duty and responsibility whether or not he want them .
he may not exercise his right or he may shirk his duty , but he can not forgo them .
they are not just available to him , they are his .
that is what being a citizen involves .
right and privilege do not pose any particular problem in the case of child .
holt can and doe believe that child should have them a adult do , and then leaf it up to the child to decide whether or not to exercise them .
but the same can not be said for duty and responsibility .
failure to exercise one 's right may be morally neutral ; failure to carry out one 's duty is not .
it would be perfectly possible to give the right to child without imposing the duty on them , the one doe not entail the other , but we would then still be distinguishing between adult and child a citizen .
child still would not have full political status .
duty and responsibility are not merely available to a citizen ; they are an integral part of being a citizen .
holt doe not want child to be obliged to take on any of these responsibility and he manages to make his point by concentrating solely on the right so that he can remark :
i do not say , either , that these right and duty should be tied into one package , that if a young person want to assume any of them , he must assume them all .
he should be able to pick and choose .
( holt , 1974 , p. 16 )
if he can ‘ pick and choose ’ , i suggest , he is not a citizen , he doe not have full political status and he is quite distinguishable on these ground alone from the adult around him who do not have this option .
holt and harris both , in the end , face the same problem .
they attack the status quo by pointing out that the reason given for denying right to child are bad reason , and then explicitly or implicitly deny them duty for no reason at all .
whatever else such a strategy may achieve , it certainly doe not manage to produce a situation in which child are politically indistinguishable from adult and it rest on premise which , unless they can be defended , gain nothing for any defence to the charge of arbitrariness .
when in doubt , go back to aristotle
the trouble with all the view which we have looked at is that they tie the notion of autonomy firmly and solely to that of knowledge interpreted in either a broad or narrow sense .
that it is firmly tied must be correct ; the inhabitant of brave new world are not autonomous precisely because they are denied access to relevant information .
relevant knowledge is a precondition of autonomy but it is not synonymous with it .
aristotle said something very interesting in that extract from the politics which i quoted earlier ; he said that woman have a deliberative faculty but that it lack full authority .
what did he mean ?
twenty-eight
nairobi .
we start with a young man , thomas fairfax , in military khaki and flying jacket , climbing into his old biplane and taxiing down a runway .
he adjusts the flap , zip up his jacket , pull down his goggles .
the runway is simply a strip of grass , cleared of rock .
the plane lurch into motion .
it bounce alarmingly a it gather speed .
a few african , clutching stick and wearing skin , watch the plane a it turn , pause , and then accelerates , leaving a cloud of dust .
the plane climb reluctantly , one set of wing dipping drunkenly .
soon it is passing over the spectacular rift valley .
there is no sign of civilization , but herd of zebra and wildebeest and clump of elephant marble the valley floor .
ol doinyo lengai .
a group of masai is clearing stone from a stretch of grassland , in the shadow of the mountain of god .
a large white cross ha been painted roughly on the ground .
claudia cohn-casson is sitting under an enormous african fig tree near by , at a camp table spread with a somali cloth .
she ha in front of her a typewriter , her recorder and her note .
a servant is preparing lunch on a fire .
claudia hears something .
she look up into the sky in the direction of ol doinyo lengai .
we catch sight of a small plane circling the mountain .
it dip it wing in acknowledgement of the landing strip , and circle , preparing to land .
claudia stand up .
she check her appearance in a mirror hanging on a tree .
with her lower lip she tuck the upper lip into her mouth for a moment .
she is wearing a long fitted skirt of khaki .
she adjusts her hat , a round bush hat , and walk towards the makeshift landing strip .
the plane is taxiing , pursued by a group of running masai warrior , glorious in their red and purple robe , ochred hair , lion head-dresses and so on .
claudia walk over towards the plane .
she hold her hat on her head with one hand .
the plane is still now , surrounded by the warrior .
fairfax is securing it wheel with rock .
he look up to see her approaching .
behind her is ol doinyo lengai .
it strange shape ha become familiar to u .
his face is still dirty from the dust and oil , except that around his eye is a white patch where the goggles were .
the masai begin to sing .
it is a strange , other-worldly noise .
claudia and fairfax approach each other .
the moment is unnaturally , poignantly , delayed .
in his uniform , jacket unzipped , he is handsome and smiling .
the singing of the masai and the overwhelming landscape are thrilling .
claudia and fairfax come closer .
she is serene .
he is perhaps surprised by her composure .
she kiss him , three time .
‘ i am so glad you came . ’
( her accent is very french but she speaks english fluently . )
‘ anything to help a friend . ’
fairfax is awkward .
he would like to say something more graceful .
‘ your face is dirty .
you look , how you say ? , a a raccoon . ’
fairfax laugh .
he wipe his face with his sleeve .
‘ sorry . ’
‘ i have prepared the lunch . ’
she touch his arm lightly .
they start to walk the short distance to her camp .
the throng of masai surround them .
her servant brings a bowl of hot water for fairfax .
he wash his face .
the masai watch all this .
fairfax and claudia sit down on camp chair .
the masai stand a short distance off , curious , but self-absorbed .
‘ what would you like to drink ? ’
‘ can you manage a brandy and soda ? ’
‘ i think so . ’
she speaks swahili to the servant .
‘ now , do you want to tell me all the fact ? ’
‘ a far a i know them .
yes .
the masai who ha been arrested , tepilit , is from this district .
these people are from his engang .
he wa supposed to deliver a bull to the district officer , it wa about three week ago , and he decided at the last moment to replace the bull with another one .
but the district officer , mile turnbull , would not accept it … ’
her face , a she remove her hat and begin to speak , is startlingly beautiful , although not conventionally .
fairfax watch her .
a she talk the servant brings the drink and then the lunch , a grilled fowl with some preserve .
a she speaks we see a masai market .
spread around are hundred of masai men and woman .
some of the woman are in robe of blue , others are in brown , dyed skin .
the older men have blanket loosely slung over their shoulder .
almost every man is accompanied by a goat or a cow , held on a short leather thong or controlled by a thin stick .
those animal are accustomed to the masai .
there is , incongruously , an open car to one side of the market .
from it , into the colourful throng , appears a young british district officer , mile turnbull .
he is carrying some paper and is accompanied by two askaris with rifle , and an interpreter , dressed in khaki .
the askaris wear military sweater , sam browne , short and sock .
on their head they wear fez .
‘ the whole thing wa ridiculous and tragic .
this man wa very much liked by the masai .
but he wa overworked .
he had to collect the cattle and make sure that every boma wa contributing his fair share .
his district stretch nearly one hundred and fifty mile .
i liked him , even though he wa a little bit boring .
he wa so english .
he could not speak masai so he always wa accompanied by this man , a nandi , who , i am afraid , doe not speak masai very good . ’
‘ very well .
sorry . ’
‘ very well .
so the laibon 's son from up there , up the valley past lengai , he is a descendant of mbatian , the great laibon , he try to persuade turnbull to let him take out his animal from the one which have been selected . ‘
the young warrior , tepilit , is arguing with the district officer .
he is still vividly scarred from his recent encounter with a lion .
his face is painted and he is carrying a spear .
on his head he wear a head-dress of lion mane .
turnbull explains through the interpreter that time is short ; it is late ; there is a great war on with the german .
he can not wait for the proposed exchange of animal .
but he try to be reasonable .
‘ how long will it take , anyway ? ’
‘ tomorrow it will be ready .
i will bring it . ’
‘ it will be too late .
tell him that i am very sorry but i can not make exception .
he ha had plenty of time . ’
the masai warrior , tepilit , is excited .
a number of other masai gather round .
he say that this particular animal is a favourite .
he stroke it side , which is white and marked with round patch of black , like island on a naïvely drawn map .
it is a beautiful animal , with huge , curved horn .
‘ i will bring you two cattle tomorrow .
i will go now and deliver them myself to narok . ’
‘ tell him i am very sorry , but i must fill the quota . ’
turnbull busies himself with his clipboard a his reply is translated .
‘ take the animal now , ’ he say to his assistant gently .
a they move forward , tepilit , without warning , hurl his spear at the district officer from a few foot away .
it is a heavy weapon .
between the knife-shaped iron blade and the tapered tail of the spear is a rounded handle made from a particularly hard tree .
this piece of wood pass right through turnbull , so that he is skewered .
a fountain of blood at first pours from his chest , but soon subsides become a steady trickle .
tepilit watch a the district officer performs a brief hokey-cokey before falling face down .
this drive the spear almost completely through his body .
nobody move .
the watching masai begin to walk away after a long , contemplative moment .
they seem to be weighing the incident carefully in their mind .
the askaris panic .
they cock their rifle and fire into the air .
now they guard the body , which is motionless in a lake of blood that is rapidly drying , drunk by the thirsty , insatiable soil .
you can almost hear the soil gulping .
tepilit drive his bull away .
he walk without a backward glance .
he ha in one hand a stick and is followed by a thin dog .
this little group begin to mount a hill .
nobody make a move to stop him .
the strange singing of the masai rise .
from a distance we see tepilit , walking steadily towards ol doinyo lengai with his animal .
they are tiny figure in a huge landscape .
fairfax ha finished eating , but claudia 's food is untouched .
‘ the next day he presented himself for arrest . ’
‘ did you know this man ? ’
‘ i knew his family well . ’
‘ did you see him after the killing ? ’
‘ he came to my house and told me what had happened . ’
‘ and you told him to give himself up ? ’
‘ of course .
what else should i do ? ’
‘ i 'm just asking .
if i can do anything i must know the fact . ’
‘ the fact are not so clear .
this man , tepilit , wa injured helping me with the filming of a lion hunt .
now i must help him . ’
‘ when is the trial ? ’
‘ it 's not arranged yet .
but i have tried to talk to him , to persuade him to say that he thought the askaris were going to shoot him or that it wa a misunderstanding , but he refuse absolutely to excuse himself . ’
‘ i 'll talk to him .
i 'll talk to the dc .
i heard about the lion hunt .
sound a bit of a balls-up . ’
‘ a balls-up ?
it wa worse than a balls-up .
it wa a disaster .
his brother wa killed .
all for a film .
and that bastard , un vrai salaud — do you speak french ? — leavitt walked away very happy . ’
‘ he wa the producer ? ’
‘ he wa an exploiter .
he did n't care about the masai .
he wanted blood , any blood .
lion , masai , all equal . ’
‘ why do you think he did it ?
the moran , i mean ? ’
‘ i do n't know . ’
there is a pause .
‘ shall we take some coffee now ? ’
claudia summons her servant who brings a coffee pot .
‘ i 'll go and see him tomorrow .
do n't worry . ’
the jail at ngiro narok .
it is a small police post with cell at the back .
in front of the building is a row of white-painted stone and some cactus-like sisal plant forming a circle around a patch of grass .
in the middle of the grass is a flagpole from which the union jack hang .
a car pull up outside .
an askari salute a fairfax step out of the car in uniform .
he enters the building .
a young white policeman appears from his office reluctantly .
he straightens up and salute fairfax .
‘ sorry , major .
i 'm sergeant jeavons , sir . ’
‘ major fairfax .
i want to talk to the masai man you are holding .
i have the paper . ’
‘ are you the defence , sir ? ’
‘ no , i 'm here to make a report to the governor . ’
the sergeant 's face is elaborately composed .
in a bare , mud-walled cell , sitting on the floor , is tepilit .
he doe not appear to be disheartened .
he look at fairfax without fear .
from behind the sergeant , an askari shout at tepilit .
‘ stand up man .
attention . ’
fairfax speaks to tepilit in maa .
‘ i hope you are well , tepilit ole saibol . ’
then he turn to the policeman : ‘ that 's fine , sergeant .
you may leave me here . ’
fairfax shake hand with tepilit and sits on small stool .
tepilit squat on the floor .
‘ how are you ? ’
‘ i am fine . ’
‘ what age group are you ? ’
‘ botorok . ’
‘ is your father the laibon ? ’
‘ yes .
he is descended from mbatian . ’
‘ you have killed a lion . ’
‘ hooh .
i am praised because i held it by the tail . ’
‘ doe your father have many cattle ? ’
‘ we are owner of many cattle . ’
‘ i am happy .
do you know me ? ’
‘ you are the friend of claudia from the government . ‘
‘ i am a friend of claudia .
i am a soldier .
at the moment , a you know , the white people and their friend are fighting with the german .
this is a very big war . ’
‘ our people also fought the german . ’
‘ your people fought very bravely . ’
‘ the masai are brave . ’
‘ we know this .
we honour the masai above all people . ’
‘ what do you want to discus ? ’
‘ i am here because i wa asked to come by claudia .
she want me to talk to you . ’
‘ there is no need .
i have told her everything that happened . ’
‘ she is unhappy .
she doe not want you to be tried by the government . ’
‘ we are betrothed .
she is my little heifer . ’
fairfax is stunned .
it take him a moment to regain his composure .
‘ you are going to be married ? ’
‘ she must first ask her father who life far away . ’
‘ do you realize what will happen to you if you are tried ? ’
tepilit make a gesture by placing his hand to his throat and cupping it .
‘ i ca n't see any point in that .
when you killed the district officer it wa an accident . ’
‘ i killed him on purpose . ’
‘ what i want to say is this , there wa a misunderstanding .
i will tell the government .
you thought the nandi , the fat belly , wanted the askaris to shoot you . ’
‘ no .
i did not .
the white man told the askaris to take my animal after i had offered to exchange it .
he took my best animal , even though i offered two in it place .
that is why i killed him .
and now my family have offered forty-nine cattle to his family , but the government will not take them to give to his family in england . ’
‘ white men have different custom . ’
‘ they do n't like cattle . ’
‘ some like cattle .
i have many cattle on my farm . ’
‘ are they milk cattle living in a house a i have heard ? ’
‘ not all .
many are masai cattle .
tepilit ole saibol , i have a heavy burden .
only you can help me .
i have to talk to the governor .
i have to explain to him what happened .
the nandi man ha run away , frightened .
i can say to the governor that you misunderstood the order and tried to defend yourself .
not the district officer 's order , but the translator 's who spoke too fast without proper consideration , a nandi people do , and the askaris pointed their gun at you .
you threw the spear wildly .
unfortunately the district officer stepped forward .
if i tell him that they will fine you .
‘ many of my people saw me .
they know that i killed him on purpose because he took my best animal . ’
‘ if you say that at your trial , they will kill you . ’
‘ i have offered cattle to his family .
i can do no more . ’
fairfax stand up .
‘ think about what i said .
i will come back . ’
‘ go in peace . ’
‘ please god . ’
tepilit doe not stand up .
he seems content .
the sergeant meet fairfax outside the cell .
‘ all right , sir ? ’
‘ not really .
ha he made a statement ? ’
‘ yes , sir .
he admits killing the do .
no excuse . ’
‘ can i read his statement ? ’
‘ i 'm afraid it 's gone off to the high court , sir . ’
‘ you have n't got a copy here ? ’
‘ we have n't had any carbon paper for two year , sir . ’
‘ wa it taken down by a policeman ? ’
‘ yes , sir .
by me , sir . ’
‘ do you speak masai ? ’
‘ no , sir , but we got the larusa translator in .
he 's the official police translator , sir .
we read it back to the man twice .
it took me most of a whole day , sir . ’
in the cell tepilit sits motionless on the floor .
at claudia 's camp it is almost evening .
the light in the sky is there by courtesy of the vanished sun , but the top of the mountain are still golden , a though honey had been poured lightly over them .
fairfax 's car appears , the light hopping and bouncing down the track .
claudia rise .
fairfax step out of the car .
claudia come to greet him and kiss him lightly on both cheek .
‘ how wa he ? ’
‘ stubborn . ’
‘ he would not agree ? ’
‘ no . ‘
‘ would you like something to drink ? ’
they are approaching the fire .
fairfax stop .
‘ he told me you two were pakiteng , little heifer . ’
‘ it 's true .
i did n't know what it meant .
i did not take it seriously . ’
‘ did you accept any gift ? ’
‘ he wa very sick after the lion got him and he gave me his necklace .
he wa in a fever .
i had no idea he wanted me to marry him when he ha his head shaved . ’
‘ what a balls-up .
claudia , the problem is that one masai , cruel a this may sound , is not considered very important .
i have flown my plane with cadged army fuel six hundred mile .
i am supposed to be at ghq .
they wo n't hold up proceeding while we talk to him .
i 've only got until tomorrow . ’
‘ please , tom . ’
she touch his arm .
‘ please , tom .
it is completely crazy .
there 's a war , the german are trying to kill every jew in the world and you are going to hang one masai because of a misunderstanding . ’
‘ there 's no misunderstanding , unfortunately .
he seems determined to die . ’
‘ determined to die .
can you talk to his family ? ’
‘ i will try .
i will also get the translation of his evidence .
maybe i can put some doubt into the governor 's mind about it admissibility . ’
a boma near ol doinyo lengai .
fairfax and claudia are meeting the masai .
they are sitting on stool in the middle of the cattle enclosure talking to tepilit 's father , sentue .
around them graceful masai woman in long leather skirt are sweeping the boma and plastering the hut with cow dung .
in the distance we can hear cowbell .
sentue is a grand , dignified figure of about sixty-five .
he is wearing a blue tunic and around his shoulder is a fur cloak made of the skin of the hyrax .
in his hand he hold a snuff box , shaped like a small quiver , and a thin stick .
two warrior , one of whom is saibol , tepilit 's younger brother , stand at a distance .
sentue is speaking .
it is clear that he ha been speaking for some time .
‘ we have many problem with the government .
they want to take our cow to pay for the war .
we give them our cow .
every time they collect our cow , they promise to give u something in return , but the next time ask for more cow .
our cow are our life .
i am a rich man .
i have many cow and many child .
i have offered many cow to pay this man 's family .
but the government want to take away my son also .
why do they do this ? ’
this is the way our law is .
you can not kill a man deliberately . ’
‘ if you have been reasonable , if you are offering your own wealth , two cow instead of one , and he will not listen , if he think you are a small man and will not listen to your suggestion , why not ?
you must kill him . ’
‘ you ca n't kill a white man in this way . ’
‘ a white man ha blood , red blood also . ’
‘ the white man ha blood .
that is true .
but the white man doe not believe that cattle are payment for taking someone 's life . ’
the masai , sentue , find this hard to believe .
he turn his old head wearily , a if to indicate to his family the kind of people he ha to deal with these day .
claudia speaks : ‘ your son must say it wa an accident .
major fairfax will speak to the government . ’
‘ i told my son only trouble could come from being your pakiteng . ’
the old man say this without rancour .
it is , in his mind ‘ a fact .
claudia is upset .
she touch fairfax 's arm for support .
fairfax shout : ‘ you are a stupid man .
this woman ha come from far away to write about your people .
she did not understand what your son wanted from her .
why doe he want to marry a white woman ?
doe he think she will spend the rest of her life milking his cow and goat ?
do n't be stupid . ’
sentue take a few moment to reply .
‘ there is nothing wrong with milking cow and goat . ’
claudia interrupt .
‘ ole sentue , i agree with you .
i have to go to my country to see my father .
i am sure he would wish me to marry with someone in our tribe .
but in any case i can not marry your son .
in our country to exchange gift doe not mean the same thing .
i wa a stupid woman .
i did not understand . ’
‘ because you have come here my son is going to be killed .
hanged like a chicken by his neck , in town . ’
‘ no , no , please .
major fairfax will help him .
but he must help himself . ’
she is weeping .
fairfax approach very close to the laibon , between them .
the laibon speaks to claudia , ignoring him .
‘ how can fahfakhs save him ?
your people do not believe it is right to offer cow to his family .
fahfakhs said that .
they want to kill him .
he did nothing to them , but they want to kill him .
i have looked at the stone .
they will kill him . ’
fairfax grasp the old man by his wrist .
‘ laibon , great-grandson of mbatian , you must think again .
the white people are having a war with the german .
the masai have been good friend .
the government will help your son , but he must not say that he killed the white man on purpose .
ole sentue simel , you must speak to your son . ’
the laibon simply look down at the floor of the boma .
he is not prepared to discus this dishonourable argument .
his face is adamantine .
claudia rise .
she offer her hand in the masai manner , her head bowed .
‘ stay in peace .
tom , we must go . ’
‘ go in peace . ’
they leave the boma .
the laibon stand to watch them go .
they walk together towards their car .
there are tear in claudia 's eye .
she turn to fairfax .
‘ he will not talk to his son . ’
he stride stiffly and angrily .
‘ claudia , you are supposed to understand them .
what can he tell him ?
can he say to him , ‘ you must stop being a masai .
you must tell lie like the muzungus ’ ?
i will try to get him off .
but i 'm not so sure now if it 's possible . ’
‘ you must do it , ’ tom .
my work here will be finished if he is hanged .
i ca n't support it .
it 's too terrible . ’
they climb into the car and set off .
behind them , ol doinyo lengai is catching the late afternoon sunlight .
they drive down into a dry watercourse and are surrounded by hundred of cattle returning from their grazing , driven by child and young warrior .
they cut the engine to allow the animal to pas undisturbed .
claudia sits with her eye downcast .
a child greets her , but a young warrior strike the child with a stick .
‘ my heart is breaking , ’ she say .
fairfax turn to her .
her face is shaded from him in the failing light .
‘ i will do what i can , i promise . ’
she kiss fairfax .
they sit in the dust of the vanished cattle .
‘ claudia , you are beautiful .
you look so beautiful .
i ca n't bear it that you are unhappy .
did you love him ?
i have to ask . ’
‘ you know , that is an impossible question .
in one way i loved them all .
i have lived here for nearly five year .
sometimes for many month i wa the only white person for hundred of mile .
i wa very grateful to him .
i wa guilty because he wa nearly killed .
another man wa killed in the ridiculous filming .
i believed i owed him some debt .
that boy will do anything for me , even up to getting himself killed by a lion .
so i loved him .
yes , i loved him , but i loved him in my masai self .
do you understand me ?
do you know what my professor said ?
he said that the most important thing in the world , i mean our world , is to live la vraie vie .
i believed i wa the first anthropologist in france to understand what this mean .
i wa trying to live the real masai life . ’
‘ is that possible ? ’
‘ obviously not .
but at least i wa not trying to stand completely outside this life with my little notebook .
i ca n't leave this district with one man hanged and another killed and somehow because of me .
i ca n't .
my life would be finished .

i 'll i 'll be finished before long .
yeah ?
well , about another hour .
have we got some more bird eye pie up to truss ?
yeah
they did n't do them !
actually they perhaps let u go back on them then
well
tomorrow
if you do that , i think perhaps that 's the best kind of action , have a word with him and go down i mean
you mean go back on them , co we did n't finish them co there wa three pallet and we did n't even do two .
there 's only twelve with a last week were n't there ?
we did n't finish them co they wanted to start trussing early
it 's what you had last week .
and then ann started that little line trussing you see , so we 've done it between u but i 've got a thousand to do and she 's got about four
ann , even if they do some
i bet you feel like a now , give them in when they ca n't truss them du n no .
that i 've only had
we give them in when they came trussed with though we had before .
it 's not very heavy really to start a truss that 's
well , with the two line going yeah would have been about right then but see , john i do n't suppose he realised ann wa gon na fetch all the people out of here there and everywhere and start that up .
what did he do , did he say
well i
ann ?
no
no so she started trussing , helping me .
yeah yeah but he would n't
i suppose that 's what john thought , we might not get them done , start early and get them finished
that 's good .
he just said leave the bird 's eye pie and start your trussing .
that wa gone seven o'clock when
yeah .
by time we 've cleared all that especially the
all that pvc , ann !

he said you should have asked jim
yeah .
because it wa between you and him , .
well that 's certainly my feeling i 'm naturally disappointed but it i say , you did well and er
mick said to me last night , he said to me you can never fit not used to it , but
no point is there ?
no there 's certainly
that 's it .
i said i 've failed !
i said i just have n't got .
that 's it .
you 're not forgiven !
no i 'm listening to them , i 'm doing a project .
aha .
i 'm taping all your conversation anyway
oh right .
not in the factory i did n't , i could of asked tom .
what in here ?
everywhere i go .
oh i shall be quiet .
it 's all anonymous , you 're not nobody know who it is , it 's for it 's for a dictionary and they want new word that are commonly used and they do n't want and all old word that never get used it 'll be dropped in the next edition of the dictionary .
i i anything .
no it 's er i 'm taping all my conversation i have with everybody for a week .
what if people do n't want you to ?
oh yeah you you have to erase it but nobody 's gon na , i mean to say , nobody know who you are , what you 've said anyway at all , do they ?
well i do n't know , if you 're just gon na write down
what ?
what you put on there and that
i do n't write anything , i send the tape in , they do n't know who you are you 're just a it 's just a voice speaking nobody know who you are or anything , they only know me nobody else .
then !
why ?
who 's who 's gon na know when they to compile a dictionary and what word you use who 's gon na know who you are ?
ha du n no speaking
that 's all well if you want it erased , i will i mean it 's upto you entirely
well you wo n't have any trouble with jeanie .
but
ay , i i 've i 've said that to them i said well you might have , if i take to work you 'll certainly hear some they said well if that 's common usage word that 's what it ha to be and word that we never use at all that are in dictionary and nobody ever us them , they want to know common ordinary speech word that we use .
ca n't get more common than me !
ey i told them , i said you might hear some right i wa in the pub saturday night , mind i did tell afterwards and he 's ever such a nice fella he come over door
so he 's killing himself laughing i i 've got to tell you ron , i 've been taping he said i do n't give a monkey you tape what , he said let them all hear , they 'll all be able to pas it round !
it ai n't , well it wa n't really disgusting but it
are you ready ?
said he would n't .
i said i got a good joke for you here , started to laugh and he said i ai n't said it yet !
well i did n't tell him it he can wind it just erase it i mean i do n't i said i 'm alright love just to do all that , i 've got twenty tape !
someone asked me whether , i thought it 'd be a bit of fun but a i say nobody know who you are , or what you 've said or anything so it doe n't matter doe it ?
it 's the word they 're interested in , not what you actually say and the
word that people are using i 've got now , so i do n't even think of it , it 's just there and i just talk normal that 's the idea really and if anybody asks you what you 're doing , then you tell them and it and you say , if you do n't wish to be on it , well
wipe it off but nobody know who you are anyway so what difference doe it make ?
unless it got personal , i 'd turn it off , i mean i mean when we went the estate agent and solicitor
be alan , be alan whicker !
sort of sit there putting what the solicitor said in your
turn them off
or if anybody told me , i mean i would n't and talking in confidence about their private life or
no .
just turn them off , and that 's it just normal conversation the word that people use in common different area of the country , with accent and dialect and one thing and another it 's for the oxford english dictionary the next edition .
it is very old
i 'm more than happy with something like that .
do we second hand suite second hand suite , the whole lot .
it 's that
we go for a second hand suite a well or
a microwave .
go for a microwave or do you just go for
we 've got nine hundred pound approximately , after the cooker and the fridge .
five hundred pound for carpet , leaf four hundred pound , two hundred pound for suite and the microwave
say , there 's so many combination that 's the thing is n't it ?
yep .
there are so many combination of what to have , what to get , what we ca n't get , what we need really i think is , what we need is obviously going to be priority is n't it ?
yes .
carpet , cooker fridge
yeah .
they 're the definite need and erm
that wa eleven hundred pound
approximately , you 've got four hundred pound really to play with , approximately four hundred pound left over , say five hundred pound , six hundred for electrical good .
pardon ?
seven hundred did you say , oh no two seventy nine and three twenty something were n't it ?
yep .
er three , two
about six hundred .
six hundred , yeah .
six hundred for them two and five hundred for carpet .
eleven , you 've got four hundred pound , you got so it 's a good second hand one or a cheapy no , well it would be a cheapy i told him most of them around about seven hundred and ninety nine
decent
a reasonable one , i mean you can go up to two thousand for a good one , but a reasonable one you would n't get nowadays under seven hundred and ninety nine
i think you 'd be better off with a with a new cooker and fridge
oh yeah , definitely i think
, you can go second hand
rather than go second ,
but , er , you know er , at least if you go in there at least you 've got
got
got a guarantee for six month
yeah , yeah , but
but , at least you know you 're going to get a decent amount of
two or three year on the others .
a with a new one you 'll probably gon na get four , five , six , seven ,
i do n't like , just , i could n't be like deirdre and , put me overall on and in go in without collecting me thought getting myself together deirdre never arrives till about three minute before she get in the door , she 's putting her overall on saying come on lady , it time were , but she 's putting her overall and on , and they all sit there looking at her and so
they all sit there looking at her and saying bloody hell she ai n't got her own hat on , we 've been here quarter of an hour and she walk in the door , take her coat off and say come on lady you 're suppose to be off your hind by two o'clock , leaving here at two
she 's right .
i know she 's right , but she should , set an example in some way , mm people are so used to her now they just look at her and carry on talking silly old bugger , you know , , shut up deirdre i 'm do n't want to do that , should n't be , co there wa n't much to put on , although they left , left quite a bit off yesterday , they cut short , there wa five hundred breast portion short and two hundred oyster egg , so deirdre informed me but they injected six hundred too many and four hundred egg to tescos all quite ridiculous .
pardon ?
put them off today 's
i know but it 's just , waste of time in it ? they 'd been better spent to finish the order that they did have , and inject that , ha oh be fair to do that to use though , no doubt they will , pick out all the thing we did n't do right bloody should done too many of this or not enough of that
ah , yeah .
difference wa n't worth putting that down .
not really , not this time of the day is it ?

is it ?
oh no .
how far back doe this go , i suppose early fifty ?
er nineteen fifty six .
i remember conway twitty .
oh yes .
you were in your cradle .
elvis , did n't he ?
i do n't think he ever recorded it , i think he just used to sing it at his , er sort of cabaret .
well so many of these song have been done by so many people that you would be forgiven for thinking that , that .
because there 's one there , one on one of these that er either paul simon or art garfunkel or someone , ca n't remember which one , probably art garfunkel a paul simon doe all his own doe n't he ?
well he ha done other people 's .
well there 's one on there , i ca n't remember
like for instance the , er , what do they call those two ?
oh the two brother .
in the
everley brother ?
the everley brother , that 's it .
you know , wake up little suzie ?
oh yeah .
well simon and garfunkel did that
wicked far out .
it 's a groovy record this .
shut up .
ca n't remember which one it is but i 'll recognise it when i hear it .
he 's doing very well , is n't he .
he is .
have to employ him full time .
he 's always quite good .
i just ca n't believe how daft he is .
i suppose you like that film .
yes .
forget it .
you 're not having cake .
doe she like cake ?
well she 's looking at it .
so how 's thing down at the ?
not too bad .
quite good actually .
yeah ?
keeping him busy out on estimate and
yeah he 's out all this week .
well , my dad wo n't pas them onto terry .
me dad said he 's had enough well , we were debating whether to give it to you or not .
but i thought , well if terry notice he might .
well in fact two really big estimate
who , terry ?
yeah .
and one wanted re-estimating , the other one wanted a few more price co everything like marble top which are going to cost a fortune to get done .
we give them a provisional kind of price and not really gone into it in detail .
so she had a list of about five thing she wanted sorted out and she said so far we were the cheapest .
but she 's got about six different firm on the computer and wa comparing note .
so i worked out and the other two were really fitting and electric and it wa all down to terry to sort those out .
and they 're both , about two to three thousand pound worth of sanitary ware or more but two to three thousand pound worth of work .
well you ca n't afford to lose them , can you ?
no .
so what 's going to happen then ?
god know .
he said , i asked , asked , well i left a message on saturday for him to sort them out did n't i ?
he already knew about that .
and then i asked my father on tuesday to remind him and he said , he 'd already said he 'd fetch them in on tuesday .
and he , my father reminded him last night and he said yeah he would have them by tomorrow morning .
but he 's , he just really ha to get in touch with one of them and tell them the price .
so i do n't know .
well , i mean he 'd done , he 's done this first estimate , these are all just polishing touch co people are obviously interested in , you know they 're well keen on our price .
they ca n't pursue it till we come back to them .
they 're not pursuing it until we put these thing out .
my father just turned round i 've had enough of it if terry 's not going to do the estimate he pass them on to brian .
i said yeah then i get into trouble with them for not passing estimate to terry and then there 's an argument .
if he , if he say anything to me i 'll just have to tell him .
but he 's not doing the estimate he 's been given and he ca n't afford to throw money away .
it 's co he 's working for him at the moment money .
he always get like that and then he forgets after like a month or two when he ha n't worked for him .
he forgets how annoying he can be and you know he swing the other way .
i mean brian 's pulled in a lot of work .
lot of people kind of saying come back again on thursday so he 's , he 's .
if we got terry to do that we 'd be well away .
they , they would love him i mean one of them it wa annoying really co terry 's just not pulling his weight .
i do n't understand it , if i live to be a hundred i wo n't understand it .
and also , it 's co that , you know after we had that row about terry , after bank holiday expecting not to have to do a day in the shop , and er he 's already owing brian a day ?
guess who 's doing the extra day ? got my dad to cover a day .
and then he take a day off bank holiday .
and he ca n't do it because my dad .
but then tomorrow he 's actually doing his own work .
so he could easily have .
and on monday
so who 's covering tomorrow ?
well my brother 's covered practically all week and brian 's doing tomorrow .
terry phoned up asking what , tuesday morning about quarter past eight said who wa covering .
and he said well my father is doing today i ca n't do today i 'll do it friday and i shouted down the stair but he owes you a day you should n't be going in .
i mean he ha n't been in the shop once this week .
somebody 's got to tell him to
so do dave and terry in the shop .
they have the record .
and it ha n't been sorted yet ?
oh no .
he 's got the gall to phone up on tuesday and say eileen ca n't do a day , we 're going to be short of eileen .
so the answer is to just phone them .
i ca n't do it .
i 'm not doing it .
what 's the point of carrying on like that ?
well he 's going to carry on like that is n't he ?
not unless someone put their foot down .
and if your father is currently taking your side of thing worth sounding him out a to how far he 'll take
ah
whilst he 's in the mood ?
yeah .
he 's not being that much
you sure ?
mmm .
he 's probably only in the mood co he 's probably upsetting them on his night out co they go out in the evening .
on a wednesday evening , do n't they .
co terry
i mean , would n't he rather have terry a a sort of permanent worker anyway ?
it 's not being fair
do any work .
oh what , your dad ?
pauline 's dad er
too expensive i think .
terry us the shop to get extra money every so often , us my dad ticking over running when he
why .
he doe get the offer , i mean
two month and she phoned up and i kind of made out it got lost in the post .
i erm got , check you 've got two day , you 've got give me the estimate , it 's got to be on because she 's expecting it to be done straight away on the computer and sent .
and he actually got that one done .
do you know it wa only five line .
i mean i could have made it up it wa that easy .
so i sent that off .
she wa in first thing , i mean i sent it off that evening she wa in first thing the next morning yes that 's fine .
so he 's got that job and another one .
she 's trying is n't she ?
i do n't understand why it surprise you , that 's what get me .
i mean
it 's normal behaviour .
charlotte 's done it too .
can you pas me that er , sheet ?
this ?
is that your reading ?
