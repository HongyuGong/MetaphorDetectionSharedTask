latest corporate unbundler reveals laid-back approach : roland franklin , who is leading a 697m pound break-up bid for drg , talk to frank kane
by frank kane
it seems that roland franklin , the latest unbundler to appear in the uk , ha made a fatal error in the preparation of his â£697m break-up bid for stationery and packaging group drg .
he ha not properly investigated the target 's dining facility .
the 63-year-old head of pembridge investment , through which the bid is being mounted say , â€˜ rule number one in this business is : the more luxurious the luncheon room at headquarters , the more inefficient the business â€™ .
if he had taken his own rule seriously , he would have found out that drg ha a very modest self-service canteen at it bristol head office .
there are other thing he ha , on his own admission , not fully investigated , like the value of the drg property , or which part of the drg business he would keep after the break up .
when the bid wa launched last week , mr franklin faced some criticism from city commentator on both those count .
he regard the charge a unfounded .
on property , he is blunt .
â€˜ i do not regard property profit a earnings .
we have made a bid of nearly â£700m for a company with a book value of â£200m â€” we 've acknowledged there is some extra worth there , but i can not see the sort of value they are talking about in property .
if they can prove it is there , we might pay for it , â€™
on the other criticism he is equally dismissive .
â€˜ that point about the core business is very unfair , â€™ he say .
it is difficult to decide when you are an outsider what the business is like .
we would eventually like to do it along with the management , within the philosophy we will impose . â€™
the franklin philosophy wa learnt in the u leveraged buyout business at the side of sir james goldsmith .
mr franklin went there at the end of the 1970s , after the collapse of keyser ullman , the merchant bank where he wa a director that wa rescued by the bank of england .
he feel that keyser 's problem were hastened by an unwise acquisition .
he went to the u because â€˜ goldsmith decided that if you wanted to be a capitalist the uk and france were not the place to be â€™ .
along with sir james he found the u much more attractive , taking over and breaking up some fairly hefty u corporation .
he reject charge that he wa partly responsible for the â€˜ casino atmosphere â€™ that gripped u corporate life in the early 1980s .
â€˜ we stirred it up , yes , but we never lost any money for anybody and we never added to the unemployment figure . â€™
what he ha learned from goldsmith ( â€˜ the only genius i have ever come across â€™ ) is that the holding company is not the most important unit of corporate organisation .
â€˜ the concept of the company doe not interest me - it 's the business that are important .
it doe not matter whether or not drg make sellotape or basildon bond â€” it 's of no consequence to anybody if somebody else make them . â€™
and there is always the ultimate unbundler 's defence â€” that he will make money for his backer .
in a takeover campaign that ha already seen vitriolic language , he responds to the charge that he is mounting the bid to enrich himself and his friend by saying : â€˜ nobody could take that a a criticism â€” this is an investor group .
it would be a criticism if i wa doing it to impoverish myself â€™ .
letter : policy and politics at the labour party conference
from mr david soskin
sir : i wa interested by your juxtaposition of â€˜ poll predicts 42-seat majority for labour â€™ with â€˜ tory hold on â€™ ( 30 september ) , the latter referring , of course , to the conservative victory in wandsworth , the significance of which appears to have been almost totally ignored by the medium .
elector are always prepared to criticise the government in answer to pollster ' question , but when the same individual arrive at the polling booth they simply can not bring themselves to vote labour into power .
letter : policy and politics at the labour party conference
from m molly meacher
sir : despite a significant gap in the labour party 's education and training proposal , their objective to double the number of 16-18year-olds in full-time education must be welcomed ( 28 september ) .
england 's full-time staying-on rate stand at 28 per cent according to the latest statistic available .
this compare with 79 per cent in the u , 86 per cent in sweden , 45 per cent in west germany and 69 per cent in japan .
to add the part-time education and training statistic to those figure doe not improve our relative position .
labour hope to transform the situation by increasing the number of a-levels to five for the brighter youngster and providing grant for four-year training course ( two year in a further education college followed by two with an employer ) for the rest .
these reform will only achieve their objective if accompanied by the implementation of the 1944 education act provision for compulsory part- or full-time education or training up to the age of 18 .
this clause ha never yet been activated .
the sharply reduced number of 16-18-year-olds will inevitably lead employer to bid up the wage of that age group to entice young people away from education and into unskilled or semi-skilled job .
employer must be required to release 16-18-year-olds for education and training for at least two day per week .
only then will two vitally important and complementary goal be achieved : to improve britain 's general educational and vocational competence , and hence our productive capacity ; and to reduce our gross educational inequality between the elite who receive a narrow education to a very high standard , and the rest .
letter : policy and politics at the labour party conference
from mr john pertwee
sir : labour doe not need a commitment to proportional representation in order to scoop most of the centre ground at the next general election .
all it need is to promise a high-powered investigation , such a a royal commission , into the practicality of an alternative voting system ( surely justified by the intense public interest now abounding ) .
such a promise would be the only hope of a breakthrough for the disenfranchised voter and would have them flocking to the poll for mr kinnock .
his problem will be that mr thatcher might decide to do it first , and then she will garner the vote .
letter : policy and politics at the labour party conference
from mr denis macshane
sir : if labour is to suggest the setting up of a specialist labour court ( 30 september ) , then such a momentous change in the industrial relation system deserves more discussion , and need to be taken out of the hot-house of labour party conference politics .
for three reason such a move should be welcomed .
first , it would bring britain into line with the best european practice , notably in germany where local , regional and federal labour court handle problem in a fair , dispassionate way based on law , precedent and judicial expertise in the labour field .
second , it would ensure that worker enjoyed positive right under law and reduce the emphasis of union immunity .
labour law will always reflect the balance of power in society , and a fully fledged labour court system will not remove class and fundamental employer-employee difference .
but it should be possible to create and enforce enough common rule to prevent the absurd see-sawing of industrial relation legislation we have seen since 1969 .
third , a labour division of the high court would contribute to the process of constitutional reform in britain which surely is to be a key political issue in the 1990s .
the â€˜ trade union question â€™ would cease to haunt the labour party and while that might upset some conservative it would be good for the country .
letter : independence of no-fixed-abode
from the rev nerissa jones
sir : on saturday you published an advertisement for the 10 extra page of news and feature that you , the independent , will carry from 2 october .
â€˜ what do independent expert say about our 10 extra page ? â€™ asks the advertisement .
the supposedly jokey answer are illustrated by photograph of people sleeping outside covered by copy of the independent : they look like some of the hundred of visitor who come to st botolph 'm_s crypt centre for homeless people every day .
given the already appalling and growing rate of homelessness and lack of hostel facility in london , when more people than ever will not only have to endure the freezing night of the coming winter on the street , but perhaps permanent homelessness , it wa terrible to see the situation being exploited for a joke by your advertisement : â€˜ just the thing now the evening are drawing in .
. â€˜ ; â€˜ the added coverage is exactly what i wanted â€™ .
how much â€˜ independence â€™ do you suppose a person ha who exists on the no-fixed-abode giro of â£34.90 a week ?
letter : ec immigration check on train
from the rev j. gilmore
sir : the content of sarah helm 's article â€˜ immigration check to be made on train â€™ ( 25 september ) are extremely worrying .
during the recent european community election the representative of ec government promoted the ideal of a border-free europe by 1992 .
now , it would appear from this article , that this ideal is shattered and a two-tiered europe is on the card .
one for those who travel by aircraft and one for those who travel by train between london and paris .
the presence of immigration official and police on board train is comparable to the scene of 1930s america where migrant labourer were turned back at state boundary .
what criterion would police and immigration official use in their search for â€˜ potential terrorist â€™ on a train that they could not use at a static checkpoint or airport ?
do terrorist or illegal person travel exclusively by train ?
this is a clear example of the extension of the prevention of terrorism act where criterion for stopping , questioning and searching are purely subjective to the official involved .
will a person 's accent , dress or skin colour indicate the potential terrorist or , for that matter , football hooligan or drug pusher ?
this is a recipe for fear and anxiety .
it may mean the detention of innocent people and indeed their imprisonment .
letter : cardinal sin
from mr jimmy donoghue
sir : the north-east publisher of viz are nearer the truth than they realise with their soccer strip ( 29 september ) .
cardinal hume ha not only the cross of being a fervent newcastle united supporter to bear ; he is also known to irreverent member of mayfair 's jesuit farm street church by his initial , george basil hume .
latecomer who continue to hope
from anne applebaum in warsaw
dozen more east german refugee arrived outside the west german embassy yesterday seeking asylum and passage to the west , including some who missed by only a few minute a train that took more than 800 of their compatriot to west germany .
many of the new arrival , who waited in the street outside the embassy , said they were convinced there would be another train for them .
the one they missed pulled out from warsaw 's east station at 2.50am yesterday carrying 809 cheering east german bound for the rhine region of west germany .
once upon a time another german government let lenin cross another germany in a sealed train on his way to russia .
more than 80 year later , lenin 's heir are allowing refugee from their communist regime escape in the opposite direction , in an east german-made train travelling across east german territory .
among those leaving wa cornelia , 22 , a young east berliner destined , she said , for west berlin via a very circuitous route .
â€˜ i still do n't know if my family know where i am or if they will suffer from my decision .
but i saw no other way out : i did n't know if i would ever have a chance again . â€™
some of the refugee had been living in polish exile for a long a seven week , while others arrived only a few hour before west german diplomat announced they could leave .
only two failed to go : a new mother and her child , who wa born in a polish hospital four day ago .
the east german government 's decision to let the refugee leave across their own country came a a surprise to many , including some west german diplomat .
some of the refugee originally refused to touch east german territory again , but were reassured when two of the west german diplomat said they would accompany the train , to ensure that the rule were followed .
during the journey , east german official will enter the train , and collect all east german passport .
west german will then issue new one .
legally , the refugee have been expelled from east germany , meaning that under current rule they can not return .
according to unofficial report , the arrangement wa designed by the west german foreign minister , han dietrich genscher , the new polish foreign minister , krzystof skubiszewski , and the soviet foreign minister , eduard shevardnadze , who met recently at the united nation in new york .
communist allow burial of montenegro 's last king
from marcus tanner in cetinje , yugoslavia
the people of montenegro yesterday welcomed home the remains of nicholas i , their first and last king , after 70 year ' exile in italy , in belated fulfilment of his last will and testament .
thousand of montenegrins , many in national costume , waited at the quayside in bar for the italian warship that would bring him home .
then they formed a slow procession behind the coffin into the mountain to the old royal capital of cetinje for his reburial in the monastery there .
what wa surely the last ever montenegrin â€˜ royal event â€™ wa masterminded by the republic 's new communist leadership , which ha abruptly stopped describing nicholas a a class enemy , to ride the same wave of popular patriotism and royal fervour which swept serbia in the recent celebration of the 600th anniversary of the battle of kosovo .
the latest biography now call him â€˜ an outstanding statesman , warrior and man of letter â€™ .
â€˜ if i die abroad in exile , let my body rest in a temporary grave until my mortal remains be transferred to our dear homeland , â€™ said the montenegrin president , branko kostic , reading the royal will and testament to the crowd in cetinje square , who carried flag and portrait of nicholas and his queen , milena .
â€˜ today the people of montenegro fulfill the wish of their first and last king guided by innate love and respect for their history , â€™ he went on .
â€˜ our tourist organisation are counting on big profit , â€™ said srdan darmanovic , a member of the montenegrin central committee .
â€˜ this will be good for the montenegrin economy too . â€™
montenegro 's young and go-ahead leadership , which came to power this year amid furious popular dissatisfaction with the â€˜ old men in grey suit â€™ , sponsored the gathering of nicholas 's surviving relative â€” the first â€˜ royal reunion â€™ organised by a communist government .
â€˜ a letter dropped through the post from the president of the socialist republic of montenegro , inviting me to the funeral , â€™ said john kennedy , a conservative party member who life in barking and is a distant relative of nicholas .
montenegro 's sudden rehabilitation of nicholas 's memory is a popular move .
â€˜ he liberated u from the turk and fought for our independence , â€™ said a small boy who waited at the quayside amid a jostling crowd of former monarch , visiting serbian bishop and television crew .
marko radoman , 103 , and a veteran of both balkan war , wa given a place at the front a one of the few with personal memory of nicholas 's reign .
for a man whom rebecca west , a contemporary balkan observer , called â€˜ repulsive â€™ and â€˜ treacherous â€™ for deserting his serbian son-in-law , king alexander , in the first world war , it is a sepia-tinted view of history .
nicholas wa known a â€˜ the uncle of europe â€™ for his success in marrying his beautiful but penniless daughter into the grander royal house of russia , serbia and italy .
this furthered his long-term ambition to rule a large â€˜ south slav â€™ kingdom when the ottoman empire finally collapsed .
one daughter , a grand duchess of russia , even gained a footnote in history by introducing an unknown monk , rasputin , to the russian tsarina alexandra .
in his minute , inaccessible capital , which today ha only 15,000 inhabitant , nicholas erected a miniature european court and an exquisitely furnished victorian palace .
he even persuaded 12 european power to turn cottage into full embassy .
it wa a fair achievement in a town which an earlier observer described a â€˜ 44 hovel â€™ .
but nicholas 's grand design collapsed in 1918 when his serbian son-in-law , alexander , deposed him and incorporated montenegro into yugoslavia .
obituary : virgil thomson
by peter dickinson
virgil thomson wa a composer and writer of originality , courage and wit formed by a unique mixture of american and french influence .
thomson wa born in kansa city in 1896 , studied at harvard , and then mostly lived in paris until 1940 .
his missouri childhood gave him access to baptist hymn and church music , but at harvard he wa introduced to the writing of gertrude stein and the music of erik satie .
these influence laid the foundation for the blend of the naive and the sophisticated which is the hallmark of thomson 's maturity .
like many young american composer he studied with nadia boulanger , but after 1925 set out to achieve the â€˜ discipline of spontaneity â€™ which he found in stein 's writing .
when he collaborated directly with her in opera the result wa of historical significance .
first came four saint in three act , produced in 1934 , and then the mother of u all ( 1947 ) , which demonstrated a new kind of plotless opera only now reaching a wider currency through the stage work of philip glass .
in four saint thomson 's informality wa given free reign since he first of all improvised the music at the piano then , when it stuck , wrote it down to a figured bass .
he said : â€˜ i had wondered whether a piece so drenched in anglican chant ( running from gilbert and sullivan to morning prayer and back ) could rise and sail . â€™
but the resulting mixture of hymn , folksy tune and recitative â€” at time of intoxicating banality â€” wa a sensation .
the opera , like gershwin 's porgy and be the following year , used an all-black cast and the staging and choreography gave it a british connection since it wa by frederick ashton .
the mother of u all show more continuity , but again much depends upon production in what is still a largely non-narrative opera .
in 1936 , three year before aaron copland , thomson started writing film score which were a model of unobtrusive clarity and pertinence , combining american material to suit documentary such a the plow that broke the plain and the river with the musique d'ameublement approach of satie .
his score for the film louisiana story wa awarded the pulitzer prize in 1948 .
another response to a visual stimulus wa thomson 's series of musical portrait of people such a picasso and aaron copland .
the first of these wa written in 1928 and they number about 150 .
just a thomson transferred stein 's literary abstraction to music , so these portrait unusually employ the painter 's technique of drawing the sitter from life : an ideal combination of thomson 's habit of immediate response with an actual subject .
the result are terse and sharply etched , like the best line drawing .
thomson could control word with the same fastidiousness a note .
he always felt that effective musical criticism began by being well written , and he never lost his liveliness .
one never quite knew what he wa going to say next .
he started by writing occasional article but in 1939 he wrote the state of music , a trenchant and provocative assessment of the machinery of the musical profession at the time .
from 1940 to 1954 he wrote regularly for the new york herald tribune and four volume of his notice have appeared in book form .
he wrote a fulsome 400-page autobiography , characteristically entitled virgil thomson on virgil thomson , and a personal survey , american music since 1910 , appeared in 1972 , followed recently by a selected edition of his letter .
a both composer and critic he touched both side of the coin : a climate of receptivity is what the artist most desire .
it is also a thing that even the most experienced reviewer can not always offer .
thomson 's judgement about music were not always a accurate a his confident expression implied : he invited discussion .
above all he restored the focus of music criticism onto the music itself .
he made no secret of his francophile enthusiasm , in reaction to the earlier domination of american music by german , and he wa one of the first writer to register the importance of jazz .
he fearlessly attacked convention , which caused problem when he pitched into established reputation .
it ha become increasingly apparent that thomson belonged to the american experimental tradition .
he anticipated some of the enthusiasm of john cage , whom he first met in 1941 .
a few year later thomson recognised cage a â€˜ the most original composer in america , if not the world â€¦ â€™ and cage repaid the compliment by writing the work section of a monograph on thomson .
but finally , in spite of their common root in satie and stein , thomson felt that cage 's aesthetic wa destructive .
thomson 's song contain some of his finest work .
there are stein setting , such a â€˜ portrait of fb â€™ , but also cycle such a five song from william blake , prayer and praise and a cantata based on poem by edward lear .
thomson wa also prolific in instrumental music on both chamber and solo scale .
for many year thomson lived in new york in his apartment at the chelsea hotel .
from there , like a buzzard in it eyrie , he would make foray round the u and abroad in spite of his advanced age .
he seemed a genial and indestructible landmark in the history of american music , in spite of defective hearing which had bothered him since the late seventy .
he had a photograph of himself on his postcard and he signed his letter following the original tailpiece â€˜ everbest â€™ .
thomson came from a generation of american composer which had to find it own way without benefit of university patronage .
in that kind of free market he thrived and survived â€” and so will the best of his work .
obituary : thomas keller
by hugh matheson
thomi keller is the outstanding figure in the history of international rowing .
he wa president of fisa ( federation internationale de societes d'aviron ) , the world governing body , for 30 year ; and most of this body 's attitude and practice reflect the force of his strict , but genial personality .
most athlete first encountered him a a voice , bellowing in multi-lingual fury at official who had broken rule or arrangement designed to make racing safer or more fair .
he wa elected to succeed gaston mullegg a president of fisa when he wa 33 and still competing in the swiss rowing team .
he did not loosen his link with the athlete when projected upwards into the presidency .
provided their behaviour wa sportsmanlike and safe , oarsman found only encouragement and humour from a president who wa always among them .
keller 's zurich upbringing made him into a skiier and sculler , and he raced for the grasshopper club .
he competed for the swiss cross-country and ski-jumping team at the student winter game and later concentrated on single scull .
in 1950 , he wa swiss scull champion and finished third in the european championship before moving to manila to work for his family 's private multinational company , eduard keller ltd , for four year .
on his return , keller wa swiss champion again in 1955 and wa bitterly disappointed when the swiss chose to boycott the 1956 olympics after the russian intervention in hungary .
fisa wa then a relatively unimportant body which organised european and other championship and participated in the running of olympic regatta .
a a rich , forceful young man , keller had been earmarked a a likely future president , even before mullegg wa killed in an aircrash in 1958 .
rowing wa transformed in the breadth and depth of participation over the 30 year of his term .
he sat on the appropriate board of the international olympic committee and wa president of the general assembly of international sport federation for 17 year .
these position were not held for his own status but to promote the cause of rowing where it needed clout .
he successfully defended rowing a an olympic sport and in 1976 introduced woman 's event , which have now expanded to six class .
his personal preference for sculling over rowing assisted the introduction of quadruple scull to world championship and olympic competition .
keller wa made a steward of henley royal regatta in 1976 , a time when the proliferation of new six-lane , still-water course around the world , which had emerged under his guidance , seemed a threat to the regatta founded in 1829 .
but it wa the spirit of henley , with huge crowd enjoying amateur sport , presented with administrative finesse , which keller took a the yardstick for the international circuit .
he loved the place and he returned every year to play an often small part a umpire of race between undistinguished club far below the olympic standard he wa obliged to administer .
he said this summer that a he gradually wound down his involvement in sport , henley would be the last thing he would give up .
during his term a president of fisa he gradually reduced his role in eduard keller ltd and used the company office to provide a world headquarters for rowing .
the sport is now obliged to find income from the more normal source of television and sponsorship , to replace his largely unacknowledged private patronage .
in spite of his gift to the sport , keller wa anxious not to abuse his status a president and never went to a rowing event unless invited .
because of this , he had never seen the oxford and cambridge boat race until this year .
he wa enthralled by the entire proceeding and remarked that only the english could make a contest between two crew which would not rank in the world 's top 10 into a bigger spectacle than the olympic final .
the final task he set himself for his presidency , which wa due to end next year , wa to weed out of the regatta calendar all the rowing course which could be made unfair by the wind .
he had recently travelled from tasmania to norway in search of the perfect 2,000 metre of flat water .
it wa a blessing that , in response to congratulation on the superb world championship regatta at bled in yugoslavia three week ago , he wa able to reply , â€˜ yes â€¦ and best of all , the condition were fair throughout â€™ .
the labour party conference : cook appeal for labour to accept electoral reform
by colin hughes and colin brown
an impassioned appeal for labour to back electoral reform wa made by a leading shadow cabinet member yesterday after the national executive decided overwhelmingly to oppose a proportional representation motion .
robin cook , a member of the national executive and the health spokesman , said that a labour government which sought to force it programme on an unwilling nation would be unsocialist .
he told a labour co-ordinating committee rally that it wa not enough for labour to win the next election .
it would also be necessary â€˜ to smash the decrepit , effete constitution that allows a minority to capture power , and then use it ruthlessly in the interest of the privileged few â€™ .
mr cook argued that 10 year of thatcherism had been forced on most people , who had never voted conservative , and that many of those who opposed pr in the labour party wanted to use the same undemocratic power â€˜ to ram socialism down the throat of a majority who did n't vote for it â€™ .
advocate of the first-past-the-post system argued that it wa the only way of delivering strong government , mr cook said .
but after 10 year of tory rule , he had had enough of that approach to politics .
labour would be acquiescing in a â€˜ democratic outrage â€™ if it continued arguing that , because the conservative had got away with being undemocratic for so long , it wa now labour 's turn .
mr cook also countered the argument that pr would build in a pull towards the centre ground , preventing labour from implementing a radical programme .
it seemed strange to make that argument , mr cook said , when it wa clear the whole policy review process wa designed to placate the centre ground .
â€˜ i can not honestly see that a system which would require u to compromise the morning after the election is really so morally inferior to a system which ha already obliged u to compromise our policy two year before polling day . â€™
his speech , however , came aftera 24-4 vote in the national executive to oppose a proportional representation motion which will be debated on thursday .
the four were mr cook , ken livingstone , john evans and clare short .
mr livingstone said he wa against pact , but 10 year of thatcherism had demonstrated the danger of giving power to elite .
however , neil kinnock , the labour leader , and roy hattersley , his deputy , both opposed the motion .
mr hattersley said giving disproportionate power to small , minority centre party would not improve democracy .
mr kinnock said it wa wrong to propose a fundamental change in the voting system for a short-term tactical vote to get rid of the thatcher government .
the only way to remove the government wa for labour to win the next general election .
mr kinnock intends to reinforce his conviction that labour is in a position to win in his keynote speech tomorrow .
party organiser want the conference to show that the party is united a never before , leaving mr kinnock free for the first time to sell the policy package to voter without worrying about split .
there is expected to be a close vote on defence , but mr kinnock is confident the new policy will be affirmed today .
the executive is recommending rejection of a motion calling for unilateral disarmament .
it is also urging the conference to oppose a motion , supported by the national union of mineworker , to commit a labour government to abolishing all nuclear power within 15 year .
there could also be controversy over the executive 's rejection of demand for the age of consent for homosexual to be reduced to 16 year .
pub rock / pint-sized rock â€˜ n â€™ roller : jim white selects the best of the london pub venue and gig in the week ahead
by jim white
general tip a general rule for pub rock patron is that the quality of music will be in inverse proportion to the quality of the beer ( except at finsbury park 's sir george robey where an excellent music policy come complete with a decent pint of guinness ) .
another rule of thumb is that if the act is obliged to rest their microphone stand and amplifier on beer crate instead of the stage , it will be a good evening .
there are two type of pub rock occasion : those , like the one described above , where the band is likely to suffer from agrophobia ; and those where the pub is so crowded , death through asphixiation seems to be the only way to get out .
there is no half-way house .
if it 's a comfortable evening 's entertainment you 're after , stay at home with the video .
dress varies , but will never be up .
who to watch while the best that chart music can manage in the way of band name is black box , the pub circuit ha always been ripe with imaginative handle .

we have no idea whether the music match the nomenclature , but it must be worth â£5 of anyone 's money to encourage them .
playing this week tonight bop brother blue band the plethora of litigation surrounding blue brother lookalikes almost match that attached to the release of wired , the unofficial biography of the original brother , john belushi .
suffice to say , whether boogie , bop or simply blue , this set of brother , whatever they once were before they fell out and dispatched solicitor to sue their sibling , will be wearing dark glass , pork pie hat , black side-burns and will be playing stax/atlantic type material .

ripping yarn and moral minefield : allan and janet talk ahlberg talk to celia dodd about their bestseller for child
by celia dodd
these day , no one question the importance of good book for the under-fives .
but book that appeal to adult too are just a important ; we are , after all , the one who have to do the reading .
there are few thing worse than being bludgeoned into reading a book you hate .
story-reading should be one of the great joy of parenthood , a real meeting of adult and child mind .
with the ahlbergs ' book , it very often is .
the husband-and-wife partnership behind such classic a the jolly postman , burglar bill and the baby 's catalogue win child over with ripping yarn and a wicked sense of humour .
they win their parent over with a rose-tinted vision of the world which is decidedly reassuring .
their book are usually set nostalgically in the past â€” the thirty and forty are favourite period â€” and often feature the perennial character of fairy tale and nursery rhyme .
yet they are saved from sentimentality by the wry humour of both text and picture .
the ahlbergs have been accused of not facing up to the harsh reality of life , of being too cosy and sweet , but their latest picture book , bye bye baby , published today , break the mould .
in it , a small child roams the street , talking to stranger , until he finally go off with a woman who ha been wandering about pushing an empty pram .
curious subject matter for a child 's picture book , you might think , and hardly guaranteed to win the approval of the gimlet-eyed child 's book world .
but the ahlbergs have no time for literal interpretation of their work .
how , they argue , would alice , or the wind in the willow , stand up against such scrutiny ?
the way to look at bye bye baby , they insist , is a a â€˜ light , surreal comedy â€™ .
â€˜ certainly if you bring a literal interpretation to the story , it 's a minefield , â€™ allan ahlberg say .
bye bye baby get away with it particular minefield thanks to the sleight of illustrator janet ahlberg 's hand .
the visual inspiration for the book wa the famous advert for start-rite shoe , showing a small boy and girl walking off down a tree-lined avenue â€” an innocent image if ever there wa one .
the ahlberg version feature a solitary figure .
the advert gave the story it vaguely thirty setting .
the success of the ahlbergs ' working relationship must have a lot to do with their long and happy marriage .
in spite of apparently incompatible personality â€” she is small and shy , he is large and doe most of the talking â€” they have an empathy which is essential to the way they work , a persistent mutual pestering .
the strength of the partnership is highlighted for allan , who also work with a number of other artist .
the time-consuming nature of janet 's part in the process , combined with a bad back which prevents her spending more than a couple of hour at the drawing board every day , mean she can not keep up with her husband 's prolific output .
â€˜ with other illustrator , i work at a distance â€” we visit and phone , but there is a point at which i ca n't pester them any more , â€™ allan say .
they see themselves not a author and illustrator , with separate role , but a a partnership of â€˜ book-makers â€™ , contributing equally to the process .
allan ahlberg say : â€˜ in the past , a lot of child 's book seemed to be the work of talented illustrator whose picture looked brilliant framed in a gallery , but when you tried to read the book , there wa nothing there , because the word started a a coat-hanger to hang picture on . â€™
given the importance they place on the interrelationship of word and picture , the couple 's working life are surprisingly separate .
they claim to see each other le than couple who go out to work , meeting for the occasional cup of coffee in the kitchen .
their 10-year-old daughter , jessica , who is likely to be seen with her head buried in the beano or a roald dahl novel , ha provided the inspiration for many of her parent ' book .
a a baby , she wa fascinated by the mothercare catalogue , and so the baby 's catalogue , which document the paraphernalia of the infant 's small world in minute detail , wa born .
allan 's experience a a primary school teacher is another rich source of idea .
the couple still maintain close link with local school , where they spend hour researching , sketching and absorbing joke .
after 10 year of teaching allan had had enough .
â€˜ i ran out of steam .
it 's a killing job .
little kid eat you alive , they want so much physically and emotionally . â€™
every year he would have half a dozen nine- and 10-year-olds in his class who could barely read .
he treated reading a a team effort , getting them to read the daily mirror rather than the dull , babyish book on offer .
these day , he writes the book intended to help child learn to read .
â€˜ a lot of book used in school are technically readable but rather drab story .
there 's no reason why they should n't be funny or gripping even if they do n't use many word . â€™
writing book for child is becoming increasingly complex , a the arbiter of the modern child 's more â€” librarian , teacher and publisher â€” lay down ever more stringent criterion .
â€˜ the problem with child 's book increasingly is that there are army of people who are properly concerned with , for example , the way girl were always discriminated against in the past , â€™ say allan .
â€˜ that is bad , and must be thought about .
but people seem to think that story are written to a prescription , that you sit down and say , you do n't want it to be sexist , you do n't want it to be racist .
in reality you just invent a tale , a if you were sitting round a fire in a cave . â€™
in fact anti-racism and anti-sexism seem to come naturally to the ahlbergs .
their book are full of female breadwinner and new men changing nappy and comforting bawling baby in the small hour .
although they are a principled pair â€” they once turned down the smarties award on moral ground â€” the ahlbergs reject the notion of child 's author a moralist .
â€˜ i would say , just sit down and tell a good story , and to hell with the morality , â€™ allan ahlberg declares .
with that characteristically strong statement , he put his finger on the secret of the ahlbergs ' phenomenal success with adult and child alike .
the revolution the countryside need : christian wolmar say britain is lagging behind in setting up â€˜ telecottages â€™
by christian wolmar
the information technology revolution ha left large swath of rural britain untouched .
the only computer in many village are those owned by the teenage boy of the affluent to play their wham-bam game .
ashley dobbs , an engaging young entrepreneur , is setting out to change that by creating a nationwide network of â€˜ telecottages â€™ .
this clever name , with it neat evocation of new and old , describes a concept which wa developed in sweden and is spreading to rural area across the world .
in mr dobbs 's word , a telecottage is â€˜ a room in a village filled with computer communication that can be used by local people to learn and work â€™ .
the equipment consists of , perhaps , four word processor , a modem , a laser printer able to produce artwork-quality output , a fax and a photocopier .
software programme for desk-top publishing , word processing , accounting and business planning are also essential .
mr dobbs , who is chairman of telecottages uk , warns possible user not to get bogged down with the technology : â€˜ the equipment is a tool to overcome what need to be done .
people must n't think that because there 's a computer , they 've got to think of a use for it . â€™
he reckons there are no shortage of possible us â€” farmer can use it to do their account , woman with child-care responsibility can work in their own time on the word processor , publicity material for local craftsman can be produced and so on .
this may sound utopian , but it ha been borne out by the experience of existing telecottages .
so far about 100 have been established , mainly in scandinavia but also in japan and several third world country .
a the network expands , so do the us .
the first wa opened in the village of vemdalen in the remote forest of sweden in september 1985 .
the impact , according to henning albrechsten , president of telecottages international who ha been involved in their development since the outset , wa immediate .
â€˜ by holding open meeting for child and having the telecottage above the local store , people of all walk of life came in - small-scale entrepreneur and their spouse , shop assistant , craftspeople and child .
now , 15 per cent of the village regularly us telecottage and at least 20 per cent ha taken course there . â€™
britain is lagging behind .
no telecottages have been established , but there are several initiative in the offing .
the most advanced is a plan for five in the north of scotland which will be funded by the highland and island development board and british telecom .
colin pavey of british telecom hope that they will be running by the end of the year .
â€˜ two would be business-orientated and three would be community-orientated and located in school .
we are most interested in the idea of networking , sharing skill such a translation and using them for distance learning . â€™
telephone cable in the region are being upgraded to ensure they are capable of handling fax .
mr dobbs 's more unlikely ally are the woman 's institute .
most of the worker in telecottages and many of the user are woman .
he say : â€˜ in village there are many woman with skill who are n't using them because of child-care problem .
but they are interested in working .
user of telecottages are given the key and people can use them at any time , which mean that woman can come in during the evening , early in the morning or whatever . â€™
he is working on a scheme with the national federation of wi to organise a competition to celebrate next year 's 75th anniversary by offering 10 telecottages a prize for it 9,000 branch and he is hoping the wi will establish a pilot telecottage near it college in denman , oxfordshire .
while telecottages should become self-financing once established , they do need initial subsidy .
the cost of providing the start-up equipment is in the order of â£10,000 and mr dobbs think space is not much of a problem : â€˜ there 's usually the village hall or an empty shop . â€™
henning albrechsten reckons that it take three year for a telecottage to be able to function without subsidy .
in scandinavia , with their mixed economy , money is always available , after a bit of persuasion , from both local and central government .
in britain , the tight financial regime imposed on local council and the reluctance of central government to take on any new expenditure make it necessary to seek fund from the private sector .
the only government support so far ha been a recommendation by the rural development commission , part of the department of the environment , to establish a pilot scheme .
mr dobbs sigh : â€˜ this is a typically british bureaucratic response .
it 's been proved elsewhere that they work .
we do n't need pilot , we need telecottages . â€™
a for the private sector , while bt may be happy to provide pump priming for five telecottages in the north of scotland , it is not about to bankroll a nationwide network .
nor , it seems , is anyone else .
there is more at stake here than just bringing box of sophisticated equipment to remote area .
a mr dobbs , who run a country house restoration business from his home in micheldever , hampshire , say : â€˜ village are good place to live and work .
the village is a fantastic institution and they make people happier . â€™
but the village are dying , becoming suburb or dormitory where few people work but many sleep .
employment in agriculture , still the main rural industry , fell from over a million in the mid-sixties to under 100,000 now .
the aim of telecottages is to create well-paid , flexible employment which will provide new job and make existing rural industry more competitive .
the emphasis on high wage is important .
village are expensive to live in and if they are to become vibrant community again , local people must be able to earn enough to be able to continue living in them .
there is a wider impact , too .
the abstract talk of commuting by rail or road being replaced by information technology find a concrete expression in the idea of telecottages .
once people overcome their fear about computer and begin to use them in telecottages , they acquire their own equipment .
many may eventually be able to work from home rather than commute to an office .
henning albrechsten say : â€˜ modern information technology ha given people in remote region the opportunity to overcome their worst handicap ; their distance from the centre of learning and development . â€™
he see them a not only strengthening small community , but also a actually beginning to reverse the population flow from the countryside to the town .
britain , with it growing traffic problem , seems an ideal place for the onset of this revolution .
despite mr dobbs 's tireless effort , this is another revolution which britain is likely to be viewing from the sideline .
rugby union : welsh horizon all turn black
by steve bale
each new indignity in the heap visited on welsh rugby seems worse than the last .
the selector knew they were playing with fire when they decided to arrange a couple of club fixture and they have duly been consumed in a conflagration of their own making .
the new zealander , appropriately garbed in funereal black , arrive next week to scatter the ash .
on and off the field the national game of the land of song is in a discordant mess .
losing wa one thing but to lose a spinelessly a the welsh xv did to bridgend on saturday wa to add insult to severely injured pride .
â€˜ in all honesty we should have won by at least 15 point , â€™ brian nicholas , the bridgend coach , said .
a if 24-17 and derisive chant of â€˜ easy , easy â€™ were not bad enough , this humiliation wa against a side who have made a wretched start to the season â€” a week earlier pontypool had given them a 35-6 going-over â€” and were short of at least half-a-dozen first-choice player .
four of the absentee suffered the squirming discomfort of being among the welsh squad .
â€˜ it 's not that i do n't want to say anything but i just do n't know what to say , â€™ john ryan , the welsh coach , sighed .
his plan in ruin , he is now reduced , micawber-like , to hoping something will turn up before his player face the all black in five short week .
at bridgend he looked in despair , and he almost admitted a much : â€˜ i hope we can pull it together but sometimes i have my doubt . â€™
nicholas wa sympathetic : â€˜ he is only a good a the player we give him . â€™
but another selector confided the truth that wale should be giving club opposition a hammering â€” and at half-time , building on their win over newbridge , it looked a if they would .
they had weathered bridgend 's early fury , conceding a try before coming back with some confidence to score three of their own .
but wale were having u on .
from the comparative opulence of 17-6 they then slipped into penury by conceding 18 unanswered point .
bridgend raised their game against wale ; now wale must do precisely the same against new zealand .
no one who wa at the brewery field ( perhaps not even the selector ) would give twopence for their ability to do so .
the back were mainly pedestrian but the fundamental problem lay elsewhere .
apart from kevin moseley 's steady supply from the line-out , there wa nothing much to commend in a welsh forward effort which reverted to the very worst eighty stereotype of static , cumbersome donkey only too willing to slow the game to walking pace .
â€˜ when the pressure come on , player revert to bad habit , â€™ ryan said .
the all black would treat such an outmoded approach with the scorn it deserves , although on the other hand they might have been impressed with bridgend 's contrasting mobility and aggression .
the back row were swifter to the loose ball , had a clearer idea of what to do with it when they got there , and their impressive half-backs were given every opportunity â€” which they eagerly took â€” to control the game .
this wa conveniently encapsulated in the first try .
wale , characteristically , delayed the heel at a scrum , putting robert jones in trouble when the ball finally emerged .
he wa scragged by mike budd , jeremy cooper came away with the ball , owain williams acted a the link , and kevin elli scored : three back-row forward and their scrum-half in perfect harmony .
wale 's instant reaction , a try by arthur emyr , and subsequent steady improvement , bringing well-crafted try for emyr and robert jones , promised more than wa later fulfilled .
in the third quarter bridgend had little difficulty in wiping out an 11-point deficit , huw bevan supporting aled williams 's break for their second try .
it wa a magnificent fightback and such wa welsh distress that they never looked like preventing it .
â€˜ we have taken a step backward , â€™ ryan said â€” and on this sorry evidence it look a if it will be backwards all the way when the test take place at cardiff arm park on 4 november .
a the welsh squad do not meet again until 30 october , time ha all but run out .
football : hazard hint at the missing gift
by patrick barclay
how to describe saturday 's match between chelsea and arsenal ?
well , i seem to recall a london gallery exhibiting a pile of rubbish , which wa considered valid art by the proprietor and drew a large attendance .
the only redeeming feature of a goalless , worthless event at stamford bridge wa that it did not require a grant .
yet the chelsea manager , bobby campbell , and arsenal assistant , theo foley , agreed it had been a good match , and the spectator ' complaint were muted .
some even applauded the player at the end .
it take all sort .
bobby robson wa there to ass world cup candidate , but nothing positive emerged from 90 minute of scuffling that made one almost yearn for the more measured boredom of ranger ' european cup exit in munich three day earlier .
at least the outcome wa appropriate .
had either of the team won , they would have taken the league leadership .
instead liverpool stayed top without kicking a ball .
television had postponed manchester united 's scheduled visit to anfield so it could be shown live on 22 december , the longest night .
london 's leading pair , a if piqued by this , turned 30 september into the longest afternoon .
on and on it dragged .
lacking a goal that might have altered it chemistry , it remained a matter of dull physic .
yet many of the crowd were kept interested by the possibility of victory , which is , i suppose , what derby are about .
they are so frequent these day in london , which ha eight of 20 first division club , that we must expect aesthetic consideration to be overridden .
why , though , could these supposed championship contender not have tried to emulate the fine passing that had sprinkled the previous weekend 's merseyside joust ?
the simple answer is that chelsea are in a false position and arsenal , on this evidence , slightly jaded champion .
they ought to have pocketed three point in the first half-hour but tony adam , a more threatening centre-forward on his foray than the current alan smith , missed the target with two header and david rocastle let dave beasant save a penalty , much a the stretch-version keeper had done for wimbledon in the 1988 fa cup final .
now an arsenal team in peak health would have kept a grip on the match .
this one could not .
a george graham indicated upon his side 's accession to the title , they would need more composure and sophistication to match liverpool in the longer term .
he chose not to hasten the process by buying .
after all , he had just the man on his staff .
but paul davis remains unfit .
his absence is increasingly conspicuous and liverpool , for the moment , in a super league of one .
davis , of course , would have walked into england 's team in poland a week on wednesday ; until last season 's prolonged suspension , followed by injury , bobby robson had him firmly pencilled in a bryan robson 's replacement .
michael thomas , several year younger , is not quite in the same class yet but may have to play in chorzow .
if so , it will be a gamble , because he flopped on his only previous international appearance in saudi arabia .
the odds are favourable enough according to chelsea 's mike hazard , who said of his adversary : â€˜ he could cope in poland , not just because of his ability to close people down and use the ball well , but temperament â€” you saw when he scored the goal that won arsenal the league . â€™
very kind , but international player are supposed to be habitually influential , and it wa hazard who in the second half , with a few incisive pass , gift from the heaven on a day like this , left a greater mark .
chelsea might have won had the ball not kept turning into a mexican bean at kerry dixon 's foot .
campbell 's hard-working side are still trying to sort out their system , which involves a spare defender and , a far a one can see , a good deal of improvisation .
it should suit tony dorigo , the unblooded england left-back , though oddly his rival , nigel winterburn , did more rampaging on saturday ; neither , in truth , made the heart pound .
dorigo at least had the satisfaction of seeing his direct opponent and england colleague david rocastle withdrawn .
all in all , bobby robson must have found it about a fruitful a a day trying to get in touch with brian clough .
there wa , however , one aspect that deserves commendation .
after 16 minute graham robert wa injured by a tackle for which perry grove wa booked ( steve clarke took over a sweeper , and is likely to have several week in which to build on a promising display ) .
robert 's ankle appeared broken , but the chelsea player were not interested in retribution and the club , a soon a they knew the injury wa le serious , put a message on the electronic scoreboard : an example of public relation from which others could learn .
pope reject runcie 's vision of church leadership
from andrew brown , religious affair correspondent , in rome
the archbishop of canterbury , dr robert runcie , exchanged a symbolic kiss of peace with pope john paul ii yesterday at a mass attended by thousand in st peter 's square , rome .
but dr runcie 's idea of a limited primacy â€” recognising the pope a a central figure in the christian church , who would exercise â€˜ a primacy for the sake of unity and mission â€™ â€” have been rejected a insufficient by the pope .
they have also aroused protestant anger against dr runcie , at the same time a he ha become involved in a row over his attack on the â€˜ pharisee â€™ of british society .
though dr runcie and his party could not take holy communion at the papal mass , he had earlier celebrated the eucharist at the anglican church in rome after three demonstrator rose from the congregation a he ascended the pulpit ; the visit ha been dogged by protest from supporter of the rev ian paisley .
in his sermon , dr runcie said : â€˜ we should ever recognise the scandal that anglican and roman catholic must celebrate two eucharist to make one memorial of our redemption on the day of our lord . â€™
dr runcie ha gone out of his way on this visit to concede many of the doctrinal point and practice which large element of the church of england have traditionally found offensive in roman catholicism .
the pope , too , ha spoken warmly of unity .
on saturday the two prelate attended a service of vesper at the church of san gregorio , which stand on the site where pope gregory sent st augustine of canterbury off to become the first archbishop of canterbury in 597 .
but in their prepared homily the pope and the archbishop addressed quite different problem .
dr runcie repeated his offer of a limited primacy , involving the limited power exercised by the pope in the first few century of the christian church .
however , the pope 's account of the role of the papacy went a great deal farther than that : christian unity , he said , must be founded on the faith in christ that wa handed on by the apostle ; what this faith is must be determined by the roman catholic church .
he quoted the second vatican council : â€˜ the task of giving an authentic interpretation of the word of god â€¦ ha been entrusted to the living teachting office of the church alone .
the specific role of bishop which is to be exercised in communion with the see of peter in ensuring the unity and continuity of the faith is vital if we are to hand on the faith of peter , gregory and augustine .
all our effort to restore unity among christian will be in vain if they are not carried out in total fidelity to the faith in christ â€¦ handed on by the apostle . â€™
in a statement afterwards dr runcie stressed that he wa not proposing any change in the british constitution .
â€˜ the phrase â€˜ universal primacy â€™ ha a spiritual meaning .
it doe not imply political supremacy , and doe not suggest that the pope should administer the affair of the church of england , â€™ he said .
both prelate referred to the consecration in february of the rt rev barbara harris a the anglican assistant bishop of massachussetts .
bishop harris is quite unacceptable to the vatican .
the pope said : â€˜ event in recent year have seriously aggravated the difference between u . â€™
the independent ha learnt that 1,800 american roman catholic nun wrote last winter to dr runcie , urging him to defy the pope over the ordination of woman .
sister margaret traxler , of the national coalition of american nun , said that she had told dr runcie : â€˜ the roman catholic church say this is a deterrent to unity ; but we say , how can this be a deterrent to unity when discrimination against woman is evil ? â€™
she said she had received a â€˜ friendly and brotherly â€™ reply from dr runcie .
labour â€˜ would keep tight rein on spending â€™
by anthony bevin , political editor
john smith , the shadow chancellor , yesterday set the overriding tone for this week 's labour party conference with a warning that he would impose tough spending control if labour won the next election .
his warning cast doubt on labour 's commitment to increase spending on â€˜ priority â€™ programme for the health service and pension .
mr smith said in an interview on bbc television 's on the record that he did not expect his colleague to â€˜ spend and spend again' when they took office .
he conceded that there would be dispute with colleague , but said : â€˜ there are no quick fix , and i will not be indulging in any quick fix .
a quick fix clearly becomes unfixed .
there are reality that i can not change .
there will be the reality of the economic situation which we inherit , which will not be our fault , but it will be our responsibility .
when we 've got an economic mess , the first duty of a government is to clear up the economic mess .
â€˜ now if that mean we have to postpone some of our social ambition , then we may have to do so .
but it will not mean that we are abandoning them .
we will tackle putting our economy in order so that we can achieve that social ambition , so that the strong economy is used to finance and develop the fair society . â€™
a for his colleague , mr smith said : â€˜ we 're all agreed that we can not spend what we have not earned and we intend to earn it before we spend it .
that will be the guiding light of the next labour government .
when i insist on that priority , a i can tell you i most certainly will â€” with the full support of the prime minister in doing so â€” then i 'm sure my colleague will see the point of that .
â€˜ now it is quite right of them , of course , to allow our social obligation not to be forgotten ; there 'll probably be an argument .
there are in all government between the treasury and spending minister .
but they will take into account the need for that balance that say that social spending without underpinning by economic growth will not be sustained in any event . â€™
mr smith 's warning coincided with a call by ken livingstone , the labour mp for brent east , who said on london weekend television 's the walden interview : â€˜ you can be mile ahead in the poll , but when you get to the last three week , people think , â€˜ can i afford a labour government ? â€™
we need to say now what we are going to spend : where the money is going to come from . â€™
mr livingstone called for cut in defence spending .
david blunkett , another member of the national executive , told a conference fringe rally organised by the soft-left labour coordinating committee that labour would have to find additional fund for it social programme by cutting â£9.5bn from defence spending over five year , and raising the level of taxation on the rich .
the policy review 's top rate of income tax - 50 per cent â€” wa too low , he said .
although the policy review will be endorsed by the conference , giving neil kinnock the freedom to go on to the offensive against the conservative in the run-up to the next general election , there are a number of area of potential conflict .
call for consideration of electoral reform and a new form of black representation are both expected to be defeated .
ron todd , the general secretary of the transport worker ' union , said that today 's vote on the multilaterist nuclear defence policy would not yield the â€˜ massive and overwhelming â€™ majority predicted by right-winger , and he warned that party leader could not expect everybody to â€˜ goose-step â€™ in the same direction once the policy had been carried .
the conference opened with labour buoyed by a series of weekend opinion poll giving lead of from 5 to 12 point .
health update : crack connection with aid
by olivia timbs
there is much concern in the u about the addiction to â€˜ crack â€™ ( purified cocaine ) within inner-city community .
doctor are worried that woman turning to prostitution to finance the habit are at risk of contracting aid .
this problem ha spread to the uk .
in the past two month , doctor at the regional addiction treatment unit in birmingham have come across five patient addicted to crack .
three are prostitute introduced to the drug by pimp .
according to them , crack is widely available in birmingham and most prostitute they know use it daily .
the doctor point out in the british medical journal that , though crack dependency is not a direct risk factor for aid , prostitute â€˜ trying to maintain expensive crack habit may be tempted into unsafe sex practice â€¦ which in turn may lead to an increase in the spread of aid â€™ .
health update : zinc deficiency in pregnancy
by olivia timbs
fad for vitamin supplement have been overtaken by a vogue for mineral and trace element .
zinc is the latest : lack of it supposedly cause a range of problem , although little scientific evidence support the link .
but some report have suggested that low zinc level may lead to problem in pregnancy , from difficult labour to congenital malformation in child .
there is stronger evidence that a zinc deficiency may cause the foetus to grow slowly in the womb .
doctor in bristol decided to test the theory .
in a study of nearly 500 woman , they found that zinc supplement did not improve either foetal health or reduce the number of pre-term labour .
the doctor conclude in the british medical journal that there would be little benefit if all woman in the uk were given zinc supplement during pregnancy .
they recognise , however , that the woman in their study were largely middle-class , who might well have sufficiently large zinc store because they were well nourished .
further study , the researcher believe , should concentrate on pregnant woman known to have a zinc deficiency or to be at risk from problem during labour .
health : alternative cure â€˜ not proven â€™
by olivia timbs
renee henry underwent a lumpectomy and radiotherapy for her breast cancer .
dr maurice slevin , a consultant physician at the department of medical oncology at st bartholomew 's hospital , london , said the chance of a woman being alive and well four year after such treatment were at least 75 per cent .
mr henry refused the drug treatment given to reduce the chance of a relapse , but there are many who would remain well without it , dr slevin said .
part of the attraction of alternative cancer treatment such a the gerson therapy is that they allow a patient to feel more in control of the treatment .
dr slevin agreed that this is often beneficial , but is concerned about other aspect of such therapy .
very few have been evaluated , and the evidence is largely anecdotal , he said .
some of the treatment have dramatic side-effects .
â€˜ if they do work , that is wonderful â€” but we have no way of knowing for sure .
there have been no controlled trial of the gerson therapy .
â€˜ if one of my patient want to give up a potentially curative treatment in favour of an alternative therapy , then i will try to dissuade them .
but it is essentially upm_to the patient . â€™
he said the nh should address itself more to the need of cancer patient so that they do not feel they have to go outside the system .
they should be offered relaxation therapy and stress management , and advice on diet and exercise , he said .
the imperial cancer research fund and the cancer research campaign are conducting a joint study of the bristol cancer help centre , which offer a holistic programme â€” dietary advice and emotional counselling â€” to complement medical treatment .
medium : return of the six-gun saga : modern actor can not ride and young viewer do not understand the cowboy code , but a revival of the western loom on the horizon , john lichfield say
by john lichfield
where are the tv western of yesteryear ?
what happened to ben cartwright , ho and little joe ?
where is the wagon train that seemed permanently to be circling it wagon waiting for a drunken pioneer 's wife to have twin in the last of them ?
the tv western seemed to fade into the sunset some time in the mid-1970s , victim of a narcissistic age that preferred to look at prosperous , smart-alecky or violent image of itself ( dallas , cheer , miami vice ) .
it wa a time when child were encouraged to fantasize about machine and outer space rather than marvel at the open space where the deer and buffalo roamed .
now , however , it seems , the wheel ha turned full circle .
the western is being revived , reinterpreted for the 1990s .
one of the most successful hollywood tv producer , david jacob , the creator of dallas , belief the western also fell victim to late 1960s iconoclasm .
â€˜ the john wayne stereotype wa rejected , along with his conservative value , â€™ he said .
a series of spoof or obsessively realistic 1960s western ( cat balou , butch cassidy and the sundance kid , soldier blue , the wild bunch ) stripped the mask from the lone ranger 's face .
the legend could not be taken seriously any longer in what had been , admittedly , a threadbare form .
howard rosenberg , tv critic of the los angeles time , said : â€˜ just look at the re-runs of the old western series .
you had hero scotch-taped to their horse and lightly sprinkled with dust .
you ca n't get away with that any more . â€™
john mantley , producer of gunsmoke for cbs for 11 year , say element of the old story began to fall apart .
â€˜ we all read bury my heart at wounded knee .
we knew that the u government had signed 453 treaty with the indian and broken every one .
a part of the myth just did n't work after that . â€™
at their peak in the mid-60s , there were 39 western series on the three american tv network â€” almost two a day on each channel .
in the u weekly audience rating in 1965 , there were three western in the top five , and seven in the top 10 .
by the mid-80s they had all gone the way of the buffalo : extinct save for preservation in the national park of permanent re-runs .
gene autry , the first tv cowboy , now 82 , say western dominated the early day of tv partly because they had lively , cheaply produced visuals , but mainly because early tv wa starved of feature film by the studio .
western were a handy substitute .
there are encouraging sign , however , that the tv western is struggling back into the saddle .
paradise , launched on cbs last season and shown on bbc1 this summer , wa the first new western serial for a decade .
it wa the only new drama series in u network tv to be allowed a second series this year , despite a relatively lowly 49th ranking in the rating .
it creator and executive producer is , perhaps surprisingly , david jacob .
why did he follow j r ewing , the epitome of 1980s tv , with a western about a gunfighter turned foster father ?
â€˜ i believed the genre wa still an important and powerful one .
it 's something i 've always had an affection for .
i found it wa possible with paradise to talk about individual and personal responsibility , something which if set in a contemporary context would have had a preachy feel about it . â€™
lonesome dove , a five-part story of a texas-to-montana cattle drive , also shown on cbs last year , wa the best-watched tv mini-series of any kind in america for five year .
it won substantial critical acclaim and will show in britain next year .
the 1989-90 season , which started this month , brought another new prime-time western series , abc 's young rider , which tell the story of the pony express .
it also say a lot about modern american tv .
because the network believe western appeal mainly to middle-aged men , young rider ha a cast of five pouting young male actor , in an attempt to make a western with â€˜ good demographic â€™ .
the effect is rather like an extended advertisement for marlboro light .
western are no longer a cheap option .
the classic western tv series were filmed in back-lots , or in the semi-desert 20 mile from los angeles .
modern audience no longer accept plastic bush , and the southern californian suburban sprawl mean the production company have to take their horse and cow to location far away in arizona or montana .
david jacob also point out that the cost of hiring a stage-coach is now prohibitive .
â€˜ at one time there were dozen of company which specialised in renting out western paraphernalia .
now there are maybe two .
the cost ha gone through the barn roof . â€™
and actor can no longer ride .
they have to be sent to â€˜ cowboy school â€™ .
western , by their nature , demand more time on location .
a a result , mr jacob say , it cost nearly a much to make an episode of paradise , with relatively unknown actor , a an episode of dallas , with it big star .
will the western ride again ?
john mantley is cautious .
â€˜ western have a gladiatorial , timeless quality .
on the other hand you have a whole generation of tv watcher that doe n't really know the rule .
a western is like a japanese noh play .
it is a stylised drama with understated dialogue that depends on recognition of key word and concept .
many of the young people today have n't the first idea of what 's going on . â€™
in the inert 1950s the western represented a troubled , adventurous american past .
in the anxious and eventful late 1980s and 1990s , they may come to represent , like all creature great and small in britain , a le confusing past with simpler , deeper value .
maybe .
on the other hand the young rider came 51st in the rating in it first week , trailing far , far behind all the modern myth about modern time such a the cosby show , roseanne , golden girl , cheer and matlock .
it is premature , then , to say that the western ha galloped back to centre screen .
but there is a puff of dust on the horizon .
motoring : a lead-free lover 's guide to used car : driver with a tight budget and an environmental conscience can buy second-hand without losing principle , say james ruppert
by james ruppert
from this month , all new car submitted for british type approval , the test which allows them to be legally sold in the uk , must be able to run on lead-free petrol .
a a result of this rule , and many carefully orchestrated publicity campaign , the motor industry 's image ha now changed from polluter to pal of the earth .
if you can afford an environmentally friendly g-registered runabout , then the flora , fauna and child of the british isle will have a lot to thank you for .
but if you have a tight budget and a conscience , running older car on lead-free fuel becomes a much more complicated issue .
without the presence of a lead compound , an engine 's valve seat go unprotected .
this lead to premature wear and plume of blue smoke spewing from the exhaust .
the only effective remedy is to install hardened valve seat or a replacement cylinder head , both expensive option .
le costly , but not entirely satisfactory , is the practice of making every fourth tankful leaded petrol , which protects the valve seat but rather defeat the object .
alternatively there are several chemical additive on the market which aim to provide a substitute for lead , although the case for these product ha yet to be proved .
however , many car built within the last few year have hardened valve seat , or alloy cylinder head that need little ( simply a retune ) or no modification to use unleaded petrol .
finding out which car can and which can not is not difficult .
esso filling station have a free booklet listing most model produced since 1980 , a doe the charity clear ( 01-387 4970 ) , with more detail available in the unleaded petrol guide ( autodale , â£2.99 ) .
looking at those list provides interesting reading and bear out the used-car trade 's view that having a lead-only car could prove to be a liability .
it is not a if four-star leaded fuel is going to be phased out tomorrow , but more and more buyer are asking : â€˜ doe it take unleaded ? â€™
what is certain is that the pre-1989 austin/mg range , all skodas , yugos and quite a few lancias do not , which doe not help already depressed resale price .
a 1985 lancia y10 ( lead only ) sell for around â£2,000 whereas the similar fiat uno 55 from the same year , converted to run on unleaded , is worth around â£500 more .
a lead-only second-hand car is now worth about 10 per cent le than an unleaded equivalent .
in year to come the percentage difference is likely to be much larger .
even so , exotica such a lead-only porsche 911s and ferraris are unlikely to be part of this trend , so no bargain there i 'm afraid .
more impressive are the japanese manufacturer whose car dating from the early eighty can run on unleaded without adjustment .
find a 1980 toyota corolla or 1982 nissan sunny that ha not succumbed to rust , and you can buy with confidence .
on the home front , most ford and vauxhalls from at least the mid-eighties can use unleaded .
if the â€˜ greenness â€™ of going unleaded still seems a bit of a grey area , it is possible to switch to diesel without a shadow of environmental doubt .
diesel always ha been lead-free and the only adjustment you need to make are mental one , because diesel-powered car are no longer slow , smelly or noisy .
they also return more mile to the gallon than their petrol equivalent , although service interval are shorter .
but after the publicity on unleaded fuel there ha been increased interest in used diesel power .
but remember that these car accrue , and can withstand , significantly higher mileage than petrol car , 50-90,000 being the norm .
the tradition for diesel car is far better established on the continent and that is where the best buy come from .
perhaps the most successful maker is peugeot , with a complete range of car from the small 205 â€” around â£3,000 for a 90,000-mile 1985 car â€” to the legendary 504 estate , about â£2,000 for a 1982 example .
the german are also fairly accomplished manufacturer , although a five-door 1980 golf with a six-figure mileage will still cost â£1,500 .
prestige come in the shape of a mercedes with the 240d or â€˜ stuttgart taxi â€™ , commanding â£7,000 but returning unfailing reliability .
even if lead level in the atmosphere do not bother you , i am sure you will find the fact that unleaded petrol is 15p cheaper , and that diesel fuel boost mpg by at least a third , most interesting .

drink : desire in search of a name : do the french have the â€˜ mot juste â€™ to describe the desire for a reviving drink ?
in the first of a monthly series , michael jackson hunt in vain
by michael jackson
thank god it 's saturday .
i know that today is saturday because already i am thirsty for a dry , hoppy pint of bitter at the end of the afternoon : an aperitif to sharpen my appetite for this evening 's indian meal .
how did you feel a you came to the end of your working week yesterday afternoon ?
boy , i had a thirst .
we say we are thirsty when we mean that we fancy a glass of wine , a pint of beer , a gin and tonic or a shot of whisky â€” the pleasure of naming our poison â€” at the end of a busy day or tiresome week .
that is not thirst .
to enjoy it , we do not need to be dry : just in need of a restorative or relaxant , or maybe a focus for a social moment or brief encounter .
we call it â€˜ thirst â€™ in lieu of a more accurate description .
no , not more accurate : â€˜ thirst â€™ is not accurate at all a a description for this apparently indescribable condition .
it is a desire million of u know and share , yet for which we have no name .
this desire that can not find it name ( though it would dare speak it , if it could ) is pleasurable .
it is a enjoyable a feeling gently hungry or amorous .
no , not amorous : randy â€” we have a word for that .
any of these condition is pleasurable so long a there is a good likelihood of satisfaction in reasonably short order .
let puritan and pessimist damn , disapprove or dismiss these appetite ; that is their loss .
those of u who enjoy them need only a name for each condition , so that we may discus them in expectation and in recollection .
come to think of it , neither hunger nor randiness hit quite the spot .
peckishness and lust , perhaps ?
or doe that sound like a firm of country solicitor ?
this is to digress .
what of this thirst that can be satisfied by an unquenching drink ?
wine is not quenching , but no le in demand for that .
try to quench your thirst with a light , fresh white and you will drink enough to put you on your back .
beer is , quite rightly , britain 's favourite friday night drink .
it can momentarily blunt a thirst , but not altogether cut it .
the nearest to being quenching is the â€˜ white â€™ beer of berlin .
anything with even a modest smack of hop dry the palate ready for the next one .
so , of course , doe alcohol itself .
it may for a moment seem to quench but it dehydrates , a purportedly healthy abstainer are forever telling me .
to quench is more than to refresh although our lying , lascivious eye tell u the two are the same .
doe any drink look more quenching than one of those italian or french patent aperitif , swirling in a refractive pink or russet oiliness , clothing the melting ice : a campari , dubonnet , lillet or ( too rare in this country ) a picon ?
are they quenching ?
no , refreshing .
in strasburg , they have been known to lace beer with picon , thereby ruining both drink ( a queen victoria reputedly did with claret and malt whisky ) , but still the result is not especially quenching .
perhaps a shimmering dry martini cocktail ( minimum dilution , stirred , not shaken ; and served straight up ) look even more refreshing , though it effect is that of a silver mallet .
in the right place ( possibly new york , but san francisco is better ) , the martini is the ultimate â€˜ thank god it 's friday â€™ drink .
the requirement for such pleasure is a matter of time and place , and it doe not have to be friday , berlin or strasburg , new york or san francisco .
not feeling thirsty , but fancying a drink , ha a world of moment .
some frenchman start the day with a coffee and calvados .
the people of munich call their version of weissbier â€˜ breakfast beer â€™ and have it with a pair of coddled veal sausage .
new orleans favour a mid-morning milk punch , or it own variation on the gin fizz .
if the moment is before a lunch on the plane , it really ought to be a bloody mary .
if it is at an elegant dinner table , there is a choice between a fino sherry ( or a manzanilla ) or champagne .
none of these requires anything even approaching a thirst .
do we really â€˜ wash down â€™ a good meal with claret ?
port is immediately suggested by stilton ; cognac by coffee .
i do not fully appreciate the experience of an american late-night movie without a bourbon , or a book at bedtime without a single malt .
these are not moment of thirst â€¦ but nor are they cause of drunkenness ( unless one try to pack all such experience into one day ) .
we do not drink because we are thirsty .
nor , if we are in civilised cast of mind , because we wish to become drunk .
a friend of mine say that her body tell her , without being asked , the season of the year .
at the end of summer , her body stop wanting gin and tonic and suddenly desire whisky .
if it were only a matter of alcohol , would a body care ?
people will nevertheless say that the desire is for nothing more than alcohol .
so why not a pill or an injection ?
because there would be no colour , no ritual , no time and place , no glorious variety .
worst of all , there would be no aroma , taste , texture or finish .
these are sensuous pleasure at their most enjoyable when we ritualise them , but how do we feel when we desire them ?
we , who have so many word in our language , have none for this .
but then , do the french , spanish or italian have a word for it ?
perhaps they do ; maybe i have not being paying attention ; too busy with the eau-de-vie , ani or grappa .
do the greek have a word for it ?
could we borrow , beg or invent one ?
answer in a bottle , please .
if you are feeling â€” for lack of a better word -thirsty , let's meet again next month .
same time , same place ?
it will be my turn to get them in , i think .
in the garden : planning to beat a leafy retreat at home : in the first of a series for novice gardener , anna pavord stress the value of careful forethought
by anna pavord
plant should come a long way down the list of priority for the novice gardener .
there are many thing to think about before even the first tentative daffodil bulb is sunk into the ground .
the first and most important question to mull over a you gaze at your patch is : what is this garden for ?
if you start writing down some of the response to that question , you will find you have along the way acquired a ragbag of element that will have an important bearing on the design .
if there are small child in the equation , there will need to be a flat , soft area where they can fall off swing and climbing frame .
if you like hanging out washing rather than drying it in the bowel of an expensive machine , you will need to tuck away a line and make a dry path to get to and from it .
some novice gardener may not want to do much actual gardening at all , but conversely , do not want to look out every day over a scene of threadbare grass and rotting fence .
their ideal garden will look good and demand little attention .
if you are a dedicated sun-worshipper , you need to mark out the part of the garden where the sun lingers longest .
it may not be the part nearest the house , though this is where sitting out area always tend to be made .
you may , even a a novice , care so passionately about plant that all you want is the maximum space to grow them in .
raised bed built down an unpromising alley could provide extra gardening space .
privacy is an important consideration .
a first time garden is usually small and certainly the typical one i am imagining for this series is no more than 40ft x 20ft and surrounded on all side by other house .
privacy is a ticklish business where close neighbour are concerned .
to throw up an impenetrable berlin wall between you and them could be tactless .
trellis is a useful compromise and you can always pretend it wa forced on you by the speed of growth of your climbing rose .
aesthete among the novice will by now be thoroughly irritable and complaining that garden should have a much to do with the soul a with the necessity or not of a washing line or a barbecue pit .
so they should , and when the list of necessity is securely written down , you can ask the second question : how do i want this garden to feel ?
this question produce a varied a response a the first .
some urban gardener , a short of space inside a they are out , want their garden to be extension of their home , with a great deal of hard paving , good furniture and lighting .
the garden for them should feel like an extra sitting room , gnat-ridden perhaps , damp occasionally , but an important overflow of living space .
closet countrysiders may want to pretend their patch is actually a corner of some sussex meadow and picture it swagged with honeysuckle and waving with ox-eye daisy and scabious .
this is a difficult trick to bring off with suburban train hurtling by on one side and lorry grinding through their gear on the other .
a leafy retreat is an excellent goal for a small town garden , but it is best made acknowledging the urban setting , using un-wild plant such a bamboo , acanthus , fig , vine , alchemilla , euphorbia , wisteria .
while you are working through this process , take note of the feature in the garden that you would like to keep .
on a new estate , there may be nothing .
in an old garden , there may be a fruit tree , or a good bulwark of evergreen laurel or box that , tidied up , could add a dash of venerability to the new garden that will emerge around it .
if you do not know what a tree or shrub is , exercise clemency and give it a year 's grace to demonstrate it worth before you turn it over to the axeman .
the mood of the garden will dictate it eventual style .
it may be clipped classical , random cottage , modern high-tech , or some intensely personal vision of byzantium , that no one ha ever imagined before , but which exists in your head and want to get out .
do not let anybody , particularly gardening writer , tread on your dream .
all this thinking and doodling will have done nothing physically to change the view outside the window , but it is a vital part of the gardening process .
before you can make , you have to know what it is you are making .
property : house that are going , going , gone : fed up with trying to sell , more people are auctioning their home instead .
andrew bibby report
by andrew bibby
in the small devon town of south molton , julie widlake is waiting with anticipation for friday 20 october .
she and her boyfriend have had their future planned for some time : they want to start farming in a nearby village , where they also intend to build a bungalow .
first , they have to sell their present house , a two-bedroom cottage in the centre of the town .
a is the case almost everywhere else , the market in devon is depressed and selling ha not been easy .
so instead of waiting indefinitely for a buyer , they have decided to try selling their house by auction .
it come under the hammer at 2.15pm on the 20th , at the barnstaple motel .
â€˜ we accept that we might not get very much for it , but on the other hand we could get more , â€™ say julie widlake .
â€˜ we 've been waiting to move for a long time , and we need the money to build the new house . â€™
their south molton cottage ( guide price â£44,000-â£46,000 ) is one of more than 20 lot to be put up for sale at the barnstaple auction by bristol and west property service , and one of more than a hundred which the building society subsidiary will be auctioning in eight west country venue over a three-day period .
bristol and west claim these auction will help to bring some action to an otherwise slow market , and say it wa overwhelmed by the response from people wanting to sell in this way .
auction certainly speed up the house-buying process .
once the hammer ha fallen , the successful bidder for a house must exchange contract immediately and pay a deposit .
completion normally take place four to eight week later and there is no opportunity for second thought .
a the bristol and west explains , if a bidder doe not sign the contract , the auctioneer can sign on their behalf .
â€˜ from the vendor 's point of view , the house is actually sold once a successful bid is made , â€™ say graham harrison , director of bristol and west property service .
â€˜ many people have suffered from sale falling through and from house-buying chain , and some of our vendor feel that now 's a good a time a any to sell . â€™
from the purchaser ' point of view , auction can also be attractive â€” if slightly nerve-racking a you wait for bidding to start for the house of your dream .
the problem is that normally potential purchaser have to incur the expense of undertaking survey and arranging mortgage finance , without any idea whether they will be able to afford the final selling price .
not surprisingly , several estate agent report difficulty at the moment in attracting enough serious bidder .
â€˜ with an auction , you 've got to be certain that at least two buyer are there who can commit themselves , and the difficulty is that buyer who can proceed are few and far between , â€™ said david phillip , a director of yorkshire estate agent dacre son and hartley .
bristol and west hope that by arranging collective auction it will be able to overcome this problem .
it is also guaranteeing mortgage at 1 per cent below the normal interest rate , for endowment or pension-linked policy , on several of the house up for sale , an interesting and innovative service for would-be bidder ( mortgage survey will already have been undertaken for these house ) .
the building society will be staffing a mortgage desk at each auction , and say buyer could arrange finance there and then , subject of course to proof of income and status .
obviously , however , bristol and west hope to hear from interested people in advance â€” if only so it can gauge the likely demand for each property before the auction start .
â€˜ we 're trying to smooth the path for purchaser , and streamline the system , â€™ say graham harrison , pointing out that live telephone bidding will also be available for those unable to attend .
holiday home and commercial property have been included among the lot to be auctioned .
although collective property auction take place regularly in london ( often primarily for investor rather than house-hunters ) , in country area the more typical auction will be just for one house , and a likely a not will take place in a nearby pub or village hall .
in fact , country auction are often the nearest many village get to live theatre .
â€˜ the local come for the entertainment , and to see who 's buying into their village , â€™ observed one auction-goer .
pub landlord are usually only too happy to provide free accommodation .
â€˜ it 's very exciting and get the adrenalin going , â€™ say david phillip , whose firm usually undertakes auction in the otley area .
only certain type of property normally come to auction , however .
traditionally , country cottage and house which have unusual or unique feature or are in need of a lot of renovation may be auctioned , if only because valuation is likely to be difficult .
sometimes , too , house have to be sold by auction to satisfy the legal requirement of trustee or executor ( auction provide adequate proof that the property ha been sold at the going market value , and protect trustee from future claim of negligence ) .
le happily , but for the same reason , repossessed house are often auctioned .
anyone considering selling by auction need to be aware that the cost involved will be higher .
advertising cost and any expense incurred in hiring premise are normally passed on by the estate agent to the vendor , whether or not the auction result in a sale .
in addition , agent may charge slightly more commission than usual for a successful sale .
in bristol and west 's forthcoming auction , a set fee of â£375 plus vat will be charged to everyone entering property to sell , with it usual agent 's commission ( about 2 per cent plus vat ) charged on top when sale are made .
â€˜ we accept that we could lose the money we 've paid to go to auction , but that 's a risk we 're prepared to take , â€™ say julie widlake .
the secret of a successful outcome depends partly on setting the right reserve price , a task the auctioneer undertakes in conjunction with the seller .
normally , the reserve is set only day or hour before the auction , when the agent will already have a good indication of how much interest ha been shown .
too high a reserve price can mean no sale , and disappointment all round .
â€˜ you need to understand what your client â€™ expectation are beforehand , â€™ say graham harrison of bristol and west .
agent and their client may also have the dilemma of deciding whether to accept any offer made prior to the auction .
inevitably they do not always get it right .
peter crowther , managing director of a leeds business centre , recently bought two semi-detached stone cottage in bramhope , on the outskirt of leeds , at an auction in the village pub .
his successful bid wa for â£190,000 although he had made a higher prior offer which had been turned down .
on the other hand , sometimes the drama of the auction and the competition between bidder can have the opposite effect .
another recent auction in leeds saw a run-down stone farmhouse without water or other amenity finally fall under the hammer for â£330,500 .
â€˜ success is by no mean guaranteed at auction , â€™ say graham harrison .
â€˜ in a tough market you need to get the programme right , the price right and have a little bit of luck . â€™
bristol and west property service ( 0272 294271 ) ha produced a brochure covering all eight west country auction .
the church built on wool : angela lambert enjoys the rich at the heart of east anglia
by angela lambert
until six or seven year ago , outsider associated east anglia with fen , flatness and the vanished edwardian nanny of frinton .
it old church , green field and long beach were cherished by the inhabitant of essex , suffolk , norfolk and cambridgeshire , but not yet on the tourist agenda .
today , i wa told , villager living around the great wool church of lavenham and long melford have to bar their door and ignore the knocking of tourist , who take them for antique shop and offer to buy their furniture .
the tourist are right .
east anglia on a sunny weekend is a place of matchless beauty .
it village look too good to be true .
lavenham and long melford , for example , have no telegraph pole , to preserve the timeless air that pervades them .
yet you only have to read ronald blythe 's akenfield to realise that these picturesque , half-timbered cottage , often painted the characteristic essex pink ( pale salmon ) , ochre or spring-leaf green , are more prosperous now than ever in the â€˜ real â€™ past .
many are still elaborately decorated with pargeting , an ornate , patterned plasterwork practised in this area since the early thirteenth century .
most of east anglia 's prosperity today is due to city commuter , the second-homes market and tourism .
the ideal hotel from which to explore is dedham hall , set among tall tree in the vale of dedham , looking directly across towards dedham church on one side and flatford mill on the other : both painted by constable .
the hotel lie in five acre of field and garden , and the slingos , who own it , make the most of their beautiful surroundings by running painting course for about â£200 a week ( including breakfast and dinner ) , or â£90 for a long weekend .
these are so popular that you will need to book at least a couple of month in advance .
the other great joy of dedham hall is the food .

a prayer for the brick cathedral facing st paul 's : bankside power station is a masterpiece worth , preserving , gavin stamp argues
by gavin stamp
from the top of the dome of st paul 's cathedral the view is no longer dominated by city church steeple but by an intrusive cacophony of drab , characterless sixty box .
one building stand out in this dispiriting panorama of post-war mediocrity : a dark powerful mass of brickwork with a tall central tower that stand right across the thames from wren 's dome .
this is not an office block , nor a church â€” although it sublime form might suggest that it architect wa adept at designing cathedral .
it is , in fact , the now redundant oil-fired electric power station that sits on bankside next to the site of sam wanamaker 's new globe theatre .
bankside power station should never have been built .
it architect had spent the war year with fellow royal academician planning the orderly and spacious london of the future , free of smoke and industry .
but , when asked in 1947 to replace an old dirty power station that had been on the site since 1891 , he soon forgot such idealism and , like any architect , wa glad to have the job .
the project wa controversial and the power station wa only permitted providing the smoke wa clean and the building did not challenge the visual dominance of st paul 's .
so the single chimney rose only to 325ft , some 45ft below the height of the cross above the cathedral .
the irony is that had the tower been higher and had the teak â€˜ scrubber â€™ been le efficient , the smoke would have gone straight up into the air .
a it wa , the â€˜ smokeless shimmer of vapour â€™ wa so cooled by cleaning that it drifted across the river to cause mischief with the leadwork on wren 's great dome .
bankside power station should not have been built .
but , a it wa built , it should not now be demolished .
that is because it is a magnificent structure , the supreme architectural expression of the heroic , monumental phase of power station design and the creation of a great architect .
bankside wa the work of sir giles gilbert scott , om , the architect of liverpool 's anglican cathedral , the rebuilt house of common and some of the last vital product of the gothic revival .
he wa a designer of extraordinary versatility , being responsible for the standard â€˜ traditional â€™ red telephone kiosk , waterloo bridge and several power station .
bankside represents the fullest realisation of his industrial aesthetic .
scott 's first venture into this unlikely field of design wa at battersea where , in 1930 , he wa wheeled in a a famous knighted architect by the london power company to try to make acceptable the coal-fired monster power station to which the resident of chelsea and westminster were taking strong exception .
this wa a brilliant move .
scott wa so successful in styling the building in fine brickwork with â€˜ jazz-modern â€™ fluting ( a john betjeman called it ) that , when the battersea â€˜ a â€™ station wa opened in 1934 it wa widely acclaimed a a supremely successful modern treatment of a building type that seemed quintessentially twentieth century .
when , in 1939 , the architect ' journal conducted a survey to find what were considered the best modern building in britain , battersea wa placed second â€” and wa the favourite of such unlikely celebrity a sir kenneth clark , rebecca west and charles laughton .
scott wa so pleased with the style he had evolved at battersea , a treatment that humanised industrial form without denying their function , that he also used it on the guinness factory at park royal , west london .
at battersea , scott could not alter the basic design of the building and he much disliked the â€˜ upturned table â€™ appearance created by the four corner chimney .
at bankside , however , he wa able to persuade the engineer , mott , hay & anderson , to gather all the flue into a single â€˜ slender tower or campanile â€™ .
a a result , he wa able to create a symmetrical , monumental composition of great power .
a at all his power station , scott faced the building in a fine worcestershire brick that ha weathered to a lovely pinky-brown .
but there is nothing homely about the general effect .
vast overlapping plane of brickwork are modelled with careful set-back and subtle band of detail .
the result is an expression of the monumental aesthetic of the early twentieth century , with strong american overtone .
when the campanile is seen from a distance , it seems to belong to some strange expressionist church one ha not noticed before .
not for nothing were such power station described a â€˜ brick cathedral â€™ ; bankside is the finest manifestation of this tradition .
now it is redundant .
smoke shimmer no longer from the tall tower .
but bankside is nevertheless a sound structure which , like the best mill of the industrial revolution , is well worth preserving and is perfectly capable of adaptation for a new commercial use .
such re-use is , of course , much encouraged by a building being listed , something which , until recently , wa not possible with architecture of so recent a date .
two year ago , however , the department of the environment at last began the listing of post-war building in england that were more than 30 year old .
bracken house , the former home of the financial time , became the first candidate and english heritage then submitted some 70 recommendation to the department of the environment ; these included bankside .
this , however , wa too much for the government and , using the excuse that public opinion wa not yet ready to accept the protection of many unpopular modern building , lord caithness , the minister of state for the environment , arbitrarily whittled down english heritage 's list to 18 building - excluding bankside â€” although it represented a more traditional approach in the fifty to the now-unfashionable modern movement .
however , caithness himself stated that this first selection wa â€˜ in no way a definitive list â€¦
i have no doubt that others will be added .
the important thing is that the thirty year rule is in force and that we can respond to developing perception of our time . â€™
earlier this year , in my capacity a chairman of the thirty society , i asked caithness 's successor , virginia bottomley , to reconsider english heritage 's recommendation of bankside for listing .
my argument wa that , a michael heseltine had so boldly listed battersea power station in 1980 , it wa illogical not to protect a much finer and more complete industrial work by the same architect .
furthermore , the listing of battersea had ensured the building 's survival for conversion to a new use â€” in that case , a an entertainment centre which the prime minister herself had praised and inaugurated .
after two month ' silence , i wa informed that minister stood by their decision .
i wrote back asking the reason for this , pointing out that , if any large modern power station deserved to be listed , it wa bankside .
i have received no satisfactory reply .
of course , i know perfectly well why the department of the environment decline to list it .
listed building procedure might impede the full commercial realisation of the site when the electricity industry is privatised .
furthermore , british rail ha it eye on the bankside site for bringing up the spoil from the tunnel for channel traffic which it is , so absurdly , driving under the middle of london at astronomical cost .
listing , in theory , is an objective assessment of architectural or historical importance which doe not necessarily prevent demolition .
in the case of bankside power station , the ultimate â€˜ temple of power â€™ and a masterpiece of industrial architecture by a major twentieth-century british architect , our historic building system is being perverted for purely political reason .
â€˜ her dress hang here' : de-frocking the kahlo cult
oriana baddeley
the 1990s have witnessed a shift in the art establishment 's attitude towards art produced outside of it traditional parameter .
the work of previously marginalised artist ha become an area of rich speculation among art dealer priced out of the â€˜ modern master â€™ market .
almost every year ha witnessed the discovery of new artistic terrain â€” graffiti art , soviet art , australian art , the art of latin america .
the major auction house have moved with the time and have found new way of selling work which in both form and content would have proved an unstable investment a decade ago .
the current status of the work of the mexican painter frida kahlo is a dramatic example of this change .
once known primarily a the wife of diego rivera , her reputation outside of mexico now far supercedes his : since 1919 , sale room estimate of her work have risen from $40,000 to over $1 million , and in 1990 a work by kahlo broke all record at sotheby 's new york for a latin american artist .
the enormous rise in the economic value of her work ha developed in tandem with the increased critical and popular response to her particular blend of naive style and incisive content .
while the first wave of popular interest arose with the 1982 whitechapel exhibition instigated by laura mulvey and peter wollen , it wa the publication of hayden herrera 's biography of kahlo in 1983 which ha led to her current cult status .
since that date she ha been the subject of tv documentary , a feature film ( â€˜ frida â€™ by paul leduc ) , a stage play , numerous publication and the inspiration for designer clothing .
in may 1989 elle magazine ran a 16 page feature on frida kahlo a the â€˜ spirit of mexico â€™ ( fig. 1 ) , while in vogue ( feb. 1990 ) there wa a 10 page interpretation of â€˜ the romance of frida kahlo 's mexico â€™ ( fig. 2 ) .
almost a a logical outcome of this medium blitz , it emerged in the summer of 1990 that madonna , already a devotee of kahlo 's work , wa commissioning a screenplay based on kahlo 's life .
fig. 1 .
elle magazine , may 1989 , p. 18â€“19 .
a with most artist who have become mythical personality in the popular imagination , such attention ha focused primarily on the anecdotal and tragic detail of kahlo 's admittedly fascinating life .
the passionate obsession with her husband diego rivera , her flamboyant appearance , but most of all her physical and emotional pain have come to dominate response to her work .
while kahlo 's art helped her to deal with the vicissitude of her life , for most audience it is her life story which allows access to her art .
in this one can draw obvious parallel to the appeal of van gogh , a traditionally popular artist recently made fashionable by the medium attention generated during the centennial of his death .
the archetypal dropout/spiritualist became an appropriate icon for the sixty revival of 1990 'm_s long hot summer .
yet despite the iconic status of van gogh 's â€˜ tragic â€™ life , it is the appearance of his work by which he is ultimately signified , his thick impasto brush-stroke , his vibrant yellow , the urgency of his creative drive .
in the case of kahlo the popular image is of the artist herself , the characteristic brow , the elaborate hair , the mexican costume ( fig. 3 ) .
it is primarily her appearance , not the formal language of her art , that ha graced the page of elle and vogue magazine .
the elle feature transposed the â€˜ kahlo style â€™ to kahlo lookalikes in contemporary clothing balanced around segment of herrera 's biography of the artist .
in the later vogue piece only the style remained a the far more overtly sexual , kahloesque model lounged and pouted in their â€˜ mexican â€™ interior .
there is a poignant irony in the way clothing , which on one level served to hide kahlo 's broken body , fall or is lifted by the model to reveal a luxuriantly perfect physique ( fig. 4 ) .
the visual reference in the two magazine are a much from photo of the artist a from her work .
in both feature she is also seen to embody a wider set of assumption about mexico itself ; exotic , passionate , yet constantly struggling against pain and deceit .
while elle , vogue and subsequently the independent ( fig. 5 ) , stressed different facet of kahlo 's public persona , they all shared the emphasis on â€˜ her â€™ , a an encapsulisation of stereotypical image of mexico , rather than her work .
it is her body a the canvas , her appearance a art .
the art of self-expression becomes self-expression a art .
fig. 2 .
vogue , february 1990 , p. 130â€“1 .
fig. 3 .
elle magazine , may 1989 , p. 28 .
of course , the line between art and life is a particularly hard one to draw in kahlo 's case .
the majority of her work is self portraiture ; her aesthetic concern grew from her fascination with the falsity of appearance .
dressing up , role playing and masquerade form the conceptual basis of kahlo 's work .
in self-portrait with cropped hair ( 1944 ) ( fig. 6 ) , she paint herself wearing rivera 's suit , challenging traditional expectation of femininity and attempting to appropriate his authority ( while simultaneously ) threatening castration ) .
more disturbingly , in the mask ( 1945 ) ( fig. 7 ) , she throw doubt on too straightforward a reading of her self-portrait a revealing of her inner emotion .
where doe the mask fall : doe not the ritual repetition of those familiar feature â€˜ mask â€™ far more than it uncovers ?
there is , however , an inevitable logic to the appropriation of her meticulously constructed image , a process which the artist wa mocking a early a 1933 : â€˜ â€¦ some of the gringa woman are imitating me and trying to dress â€˜ a la mexicana â€™ , but the poor soul only look like cabbage and to tell you the naked truth they look absolutely impossible . '
the â€˜ impossibility â€™ stemmed from the failure of such follower to recognise the symbolic importance of kahlo 's choice of clothing , a failure also intrinsic to her recent magazine appearance .
the particularity of post-revolutionary mexico are frequently subsumed by the decorativeness of the ethnic , by the generalised attractiveness of the radical avant-garde .
for kahlo , however , choosing to don the costume of the tehuana , a for example in tree of hope ( 1946 ) ( fig. 8 ) , wa to embody a powerful icon of cultural identity .
mexican indian dress is extraordinarily diverse and by and large geographically specific , varying from region to region .
the tehuana dress is by no mean the most decorative variant or the closest to pre-hispanic form of clothing .
it is the mythology surrounding the woman wearer of the costume which directed kahlo 's choice .
the ostensibly matriarchal society of tehuantepec led to the adoption of the tehuana , in post-revolutionary mexico , a the image of the strong indian woman ; the undefeated counterpart to the despised â€˜ chingada â€™ , who , conversely is the female embodiment of mexico 's hybrid post-conquest culture .
in a culture where sexual metaphor are frequently used to convey racial and political conflict , the tehuana represents that aspect of mexico 's indigenous tradition unbowed by century of colonial and male rule .
kahlo 's adoption of tehuana dress , while being an attractive disguise of what she saw a a le than perfect body , asserted both a feminist and an anti-colonialist position .
fig. 4 .
vogue , february 1990 , p. 138 .
fig. 5 .
the independent on sunday , 8th april 1990 , p. 37 .
in kahlo 's work there is a powerful mix of these discourse , yet her role a an archetypal woman painter ha come to dominate response to her work .
it is through her emergence a a cult painter of the feminist movement of the 1970s that her current reputation ha evolved .
her work almost perfectly illustrates debate a to the nature of traditional exclusion of a woman 's art .
the fascination with function of the body , the analogy between artistic and physical creative process , self-portraiture used to reveal the female body a the site of patriarchal aesthetic discourse ; all of these mirror the concern of many woman painter of the 1980s .

in their formal language , kahlo 's work are exemplary of certain feminist argument ; the adoption of the decorative , the intimate and non-fine art medium reveals the restrictive nature of traditional definition of â€˜ high art â€™ .
this â€˜ appropriateness â€™ of kahlo 's aesthetic to contemporary debate ha tended to remove her work from it historical context , to stress the collective and the cross-cultural .
although this is not in itself to be dismissed a a tactic , it ha diminished the complexity of kahlo 's achievement a a specifically mexican painter , operating within the particularity of her historical moment .
more problematic is the way in which such a dislocation ha led to the acceptance of her â€˜ mexicanness â€™ a mere decoration of the essentially feminist theme of her work , thereby defusing a substantial part of the art described by breton a a â€˜ ribbon round a bomb â€™ .
it is the ribbon that run through the page of vogue , the glossy surface of the image in direct opposition to a work such a kahlo 's the suicide of dorothy hale ( 1939 ) ( fig. 9 ) .
in this painting , a memorial to a woman 's tragic death is transformed into an indictment of the culture which destroyed her .
hale 's suicide became a poignant metaphor for the oppressive nature of the social value of new york and north america in general .
the story behind hale 's death wa one with which kahlo obviously identified , and within which dress formed an important symbolic function .
before jumping from the window of her apartment , hale had dressed meticulously in her most flattering dress , the corsage of yellow rose a gift from a male admirer .
in kahlo 's painting , the figure fall from the fantasy world she ha inhabited to the harsh bloodspattered reality of the street , literally coming down to earth .
hale 's eye stare knowingly at the viewer , a human sacrifice to an alienated and consumerist culture .
the horizontality of her fallen body is juxtaposed to the vertical thrust of the apartment building .
she leap from an architectural monument to a phallocentric world .
although destroyed , she ha also escaped .
the painting , dedicated to hale 's mother , wa commissioned by a mutual friend of kahlo and dorothy hale , the managing editor of vanity fair , clare boothe luce .
the painting wa agreed to by luce in part to recompense for what she saw a her misjudgment of her dead friend .
having lent hale money to pay her rent she had been angered to discover her spending enormous sum on an haute-couture dress , and refused to turn up to what , in retrospect , became hale 's farewell party .
later it wa revealed that the money had come from a different source .
a male friend had tried to dissuade hale from seeking a much needed job and had given her a thousand dollar to buy â€˜ the most beautiful dress in new york â€™ , telling her that what she needed wa to find a rich husband .
on one level this work deal with a generalised â€˜ woman 's experience â€™ , yet the metaphorical power of dorothy hale 's dress derives from kahlo 's use of clothing in her own self-portrait .
dress not only cover and decorates the body but instils in the wearer it own characteristic strength and weakness .
hale 's black velvet dress is cursed because it represents the value of the â€˜ gringolandia â€™ so hated by kahlo .
in those painting where kahlo wear european dress she is passive , weak and unable to control her own destiny , but in the tehuana costume she is strong , powerful , hopeful .
unclothed , her body becomes yet more vulnerable , but a jean franco state :
the unclothed body is not a â€˜ self but a socialised body , a body that is opened by instrument , technologized , wounded , it organ displayed to the outside world .
the â€˜ inner â€™ frida is controlled by modern society far more than the clothed frida , who often mark her deviation from the norm by defiantly returning the gaze of the viewer .
kahlo 's naked body becomes not just the tortured self of her personal biography but a visual counterpart to the injured and defiled manifestation of mexico 's colonised past : la llorona â€˜ the weeping woman â€™ of popular myth and la chingada , the raped and abused mother described in paz 's the labyrinth of solitude .
descended from an aztec mother goddess , llorona is a long-suffering mother figure , symbolic in a wider sense of the trauma of the spanish invasion .
driven mad with grief by the loss of her child , she is thought to wander the street weeping and cry out a ghostly memory of the pre-conquest past .
at it most simple , la chingada , a the mother of mestizo culture is â€˜ the mother forcibly opened , violated or deceived â€™ .
the female soil possessed and misused by the masculine force of the spanish invader .
the indian mexico raped and abused by the conquistador yet bearing his bastard child .
the rhetoric of the tehuana opposes the nihilism of traditional feminisation of colonial trauma , and asserts the potential of a dignified cultural resistance .

phoenix art museum , arizona .
a major , though often ignored , work by kahlo demonstrates the cultural politics underlying her art .
my dress hang there ( 1939 ) ( fig. 10 ) is one of the artist â€™ s most formally adventurous work , mixing photographic collage with paint to produce a critique of north american culture .
kahlo doe not appear in the work , her tehuana costume hang empty in the centre of the composition , suspended between a toilet bowl and a golfing trophy .
on one level my dress â€¦ is a coda to self-portrait on the borderline ( 1932 ) ( fig. 11 ) of the previous year .
this small painting on metal , in the style of a catholic votive image , show the artist poised between the technological inhumanity of a capitalist north america and the archaic fertility of mexico .
interwoven with these image are subtler reference to the metaphorical borderline which separate latin american culture from that of europe and north america .
this is done by a series of juxtaposition ; the past versus the present ; female nature versus masculine technology ; growth versus exploitation ; and in it very material presence , the tradition of fine art versus the popular .
at the same time the ambivalence of her own , and modern mexico 's position is manifested in the figure of the artist .
the paper flag of her homeland is contrasted to the modernity of the cigarette held in her other hand .
the red and green of the aztec necklace link it compositionally with the indigenous plant to the â€˜ south â€™ of the painting , the pink colonial-style dress tonally blending with the skyscraper to the â€˜ north â€™ .
my dress â€¦ again suggests a conflict , but the ambivalence is gone .
nature ha been banished , technology and it concomitant value reign over a harshly masculine world .
three element refer to the female presence , all of them dealing with an essential lack .
the empty dress , a peeling poster of mae west and in the far distance the statue of liberty .

leo eloesser .
although occasionally humorous , the work present a bleak view of urban alienation .
the church , wall street , and industry are joined by a network of telephone line , forming a remorsely inhuman environment .
beneath this man-made mechanism of oppression are the people , literally distanced from their surroundings by kahlo 's use of photo-collage .
in the forefront of this scene flutter the dress , incongruously vibrant despite it suggestion of loss .
dislocated from it political context , it hang like a piã±ata above the teeming street of the city ; decorative yet potentially explosive .
there is no place â€˜ there â€™ for the value the tehuana dress represents , it fold are given meaning by kahlo 's search for a cultural identity .
within the confines of the painting it becomes a silent emblem of protest , a reminder of political alternative .
the physicality so characteristic of kahlo 's work is missing , no flesh , no blood , just the tawdriness of the peeling poster and the hollow reminder of lost liberty .
the inter-relationship of body and dress so self-consciously referred to in many of kahlo 's most polemical work ( fig. 12 ) ha been strangely inverted by her current popularity .
her â€˜ mexicanness â€™ ha become a stylistic gloss , decorative , colourful , pretty , even individualistic .
the colonised body which kahlo clothed in revolutionary idealism ha lost it function a a symbol of nationhood becoming instead an icon of female suffering .
what is obscured by this process is that it wa through clothing , in both art and life , that kahlo attempted to redress the wrong of history .

jackboot beneath the serge television .
by hugh hebert
there wa one point when the hair on the back of my head began to lift .
not at paul hill 's remembrance of beating past , when he could hear the sound of steel-tipped boot running to take part in the fun , and once heard a principal medical officer , no le , telling colleague : â€˜ do n't walk his face , do n't walk his face . â€™
not even the time he wa dunked head first in a tub of dubious liquid , and brought up gasping for breath : â€˜ make him sing god save the queen ! â€™ they shouted .
brutality , a hill describes and felt it , wa a bitter part of his prison life ; you just learnt to get down on the floor a fast a you could and cover up a best you could .
but it wa gerry conlon 's account of being interrogated after the guildford bombing that made the scalp crawl .
we know your mother work at the royal victoria hospital , they told him , we know where your sister work , and there are sectarian killing down there .
â€˜ they told me they could arrange an â€˜ accident â€™ .
and i believed they were capable of murdering my mother , i honestly believe they would have murdered my mother â€” that 's why i signed the statement . â€™
the account he gave just after his release wa that the threat had been that a british soldier might â€˜ accidentally â€™ shoot one of the woman .
a few month ago even , this would have seemed improbable .
you might have assumed this wa the police bluffing and bullying .
yet given what we have learned about link between the security service and the loyalist paramilitary in northern ireland , and the deep suspicion about surrogate murder , you ca n't shrug off the shiver conlon 's word bring .
there were daunting moment in last night 's first tuesday ( yorkshire ) , but few of them matched that hint of a jackboot under the blue serge .
it 's right that the guildford four have told their story now to grant mckee and ro franey and first tuesday , the programme and the producer who dug away , and did much to keep the case alive .
and they told it without on-screen questioning , though the programme is skilfully structured to give it a coherence it might have lacked .
carole richardson 's is the most haunting face .
you have to hope that it blankness will slowly dissolve and let life in .
just once a couple of tear rolled down .
it wa when she described seeing film of the result of the bombing on television , and thinking : â€˜ they think i did that ! â€™
armstrong seems the least permanently damaged on the surface .
he pay tribute to his treatment at gartree prison , he apologises to the bomb victim ' family that they have had to keep reminding them of their loss : â€˜ but we had to fight for our freedom . â€™
hill express the way time ha cheated them : his daughter wa born while he wa remanded in custody , and is now 14 : â€˜ she would change dramatically and i did n't feel a change in myself mentally .
i 'm still 20 in my head .
nothing 's happened to me .
i have n't lived . â€™
but again it wa conlon , the slightly wild-eyed irish poet of the quartet , articulate , flamboyant â€” remember that extraordinary exit through the front door of the old bailey â€” who cut deep into the collective conscience .
he described being taken over the year to see his sick , and finally dying and almost certainly innocent father in another prison .
he wa convicted with the maguires in the parallel case of a â€˜ bomb factory â€™ .
and he tell how none of the assembled guard and official could look his father in the eye a he protested his innocence .
only the nurse could do that .
and at the end , conlon drew the one hopeful conclusion : â€˜ if this stop capital punishment ever coming back , the time i 've spent in prison will be well worth it .
if this stop another innocent person going to prison , it 'll be well worth it â€¦
â€˜ i 've had numerous prison governor say to me , yes , conlon , we know you 're innocent , but there 's nothing we can do about it .
we get a custody order , and that 's it .
what sort of system of justice is that ? â€™
it wa n't the only programme last night to shine light into dirty corner .
inside the brotherhood ( granada ) , produced by claudia milne and martin short , dug into the most notorious area of masonic influence , local government .
in southend , where 3,000 of the 50,000 adult male are reckoned to be mason , it went into the case of what you might call preferential allocation of council property , and the battle of one councillor , christopher hudson , to break the grip of the men on the square : â€˜ we ca n't have a secret society operating within the framework of a democracy , â€™ he said .
â€˜ it 's a paradox , it 's a nonsense . â€™
though over the year , from southend to tyneside and the government 's own property service agency , there 's all too much evidence that this is exactly what we do have .

although that is the position in law , the court emphasised that a a matter of commonm_sense a tenant should first complain to the landlord before exercising the right to prosecute .
the fact .
mr bujok and her family occupied a house a council tenant .
in september 1988 mr bujok laid an information against the council alleging the existence and continuance of a statutory nuisance under section 92(1) of the public health act 1936 .
it wa alleged that the council , being the owner of the premise , were the person by whose act , default or sufferance the nuisance arose .
prior to laying the information mr bujok had not served an abatement notice upon the council or informed them of the alleged defect in the premise .
the justice held mr bujok wa not required to ensure that the council were aware of the defective state of the property prior to laying the information .
the council appealed by case stated .
the legislation .
section 92(1) of the 1936 act defines â€˜ statutory nuisance â€™ a â€˜ any premise in such a state a to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance â€™ .
the decision .
mr justice hutchison said the 1936 act primarily envisages a system where the local authority ha a power and a duty to try to secure that premise are not in a state which constitutes a statutory nuisance .
action is initiated by the service of an abatement notice requiring remedial work .
if the person in default fails to comply with an abatement notice the local authority is obliged to make a complaint to the magistrate .
if the complaint is proved , a nuisance order is made requiring the defendant to get the necessary work done .
effectively the sequence is that the person in default is told what is wrong and is required to put it right .
he is given an opportunity to do so , and if he doe not , he is subject to sanction by the court to compel him to do so .
the problem arises in connection with section 99 which adapts or applies the provision to case where an individual rather than the local authority wish to make the complaint .
need he serve an abatement notice ?
the authority plainly establish that he need not and can not do so .
doe that mean he may lay an information and bring the matter before the magistrate without first putting the person alleged to be in default on notice of what is alleged ?
the council argued that a landlord , particularly one such a a local authority , can not realistically be expected to have a system of inspection of all it premise and in practice is entitled to depend upon notification by it tenant .
for mr bujok it wa argued that the 1936 act wa designed to secure in the interest of the community at large that statutory nuisance did not exist .
it wa submitted that an owner can not turn his back on his property because when he purchase and take on the responsibility of letting , he know the property will in the course of time deteriorate .
he must therefore satisfy himself on a regular basis that it doe not constitute a statutory nuisance .
in warner v lambeth london borough council ( 1985 ) 15 hlr 45 , 50 , lord justice glidewell said a private person could lay an information alleging the failure to abate a statutory nuisance without first giving notice requiring abatement .
therefore in the present case the justice came to the correct conclusion .
his lordship reached that decision without enthusiasm because it seemed that a a matter of common sense , notice should be given in such circumstance before criminal proceeding were launched .
lord justice watkins said he agreed with reluctance .
it wa surely repugnant to commonm_sense that in this area of legal activity a local authority should be prosecuted by one of it tenant without first being given the opportunity by that tenant to remedy the consequence of a neglect to repair the dwelling that the tenant occupied .
in law there wa no doubt that mr bujok wa entitled to commence proceeding without giving notice of the state of the dwelling to the council .
but in every other conceivable way that action wa entirely wrong .
endless trouble to many people in court and council office and much money could be saved by the giving of notice of disrepair .
if the council did not react to that notice , then would be the time for the tenant to exercise the right to prosecute .
parliament should give fresh thought to enacting a provision placing an obligation upon a council tenant to give notice to the council before being permitted to commence proceeding .

leinster face an uphill task .
by robert armstrong in dublin
the all black begin the irish leg of their 13-match tour at lansdowne road today against leinster , who have never beaten a major touring side .
leinster have named a team that look strong on paper , including eight international , yet they recently lost to both munster and ulster in the inter-provincial championship .
such is the mood of pessimism here it is hard to find anyone who belief the all black , having won their seven match in wale , will face any significant threat during the next fortnight .
ulster , the provincial champion , may well fancy their chance on november 21 , but leinster look certain to face an uphill struggle even though the tourist have rested 13 of the team that beat wale .
leinster will be hard pushed to keep the score within the respectable margin of defeat set by their predecessor .
in 1964 the all black defeated leinster 11-5 , they won 17-8 in 1972 and scraped home 8-3 in 1974 .
however , during the eighty irish provincial rugby ha assumed a third world status in relation to new zealand 's .
leinster have been undermined by their failure to secure prestige fixture since the mid-seventies .
when new zealand last toured ireland in 1978 leinster were ignored .
the same thing happened in 1984 when the province wa denied a fixture against the wallaby .
such neglect ha done nothing for their confidence .
even so , the all black , who include seven capped player , will give today 's opponent due respect .
a their coach , alex wyllie , remarked : â€˜ when we arrived in wale we were told cardiff were no damned good and look how well they played against u .
leinster are quite capable of doing the same . â€™
wyllie is confident his western samoan wing , va'aiga tuigamala , will play although he is still niggled by an ankle injury received against neath two week ago .
the test flanker alan whetton , whose hamstring injury kept him out against wale , will form a powerful back row with kevin schuler and the international no.8 , zinzan brooke .
the tourist will field four back aged 21 or under .
for their part , leinster are boosted by the presence of four player already selected for ireland to play new zealand in dublin on november 18 .
they are brendan mullin , the lion centre , fergus aherne , the scrum-half , and the two new cap , nick popplewell at loose-head and brian smith , the fly-half .
no doubt smith , the oxford university australian , who won five cap for the wallaby , will feel a bit closer to home facing the all black twice in the next 11 day .
it will be fascinating to see how smith , a gifted all-round footballer , shape up in his prospective international partnership with aherne .
equally intriguing will be the line-out performance of the young london irish lock , neil francis , who ha been left out of the current ireland squad .
fortunately , leinster 's front five , which includes the experienced tight-head prop de fitzgerald , look upm_to the task of scrummaging against the all black .
however , real problem may arise once leinster attempt to win the loose ball .
leinster will be led by their third captain in a many match , the centre paul clinch .
leinster : f dunlea ; j sexton , p clinch ( capt ) , b mullin , p purcell ; b smith , f aherne ; n popplewell , n kearney , d fitzgerald , n francis , b rigney , p kenny , k leahy , a blair .
all black : m ridge ; j timu , b mccahill , w little , v tuigamala ; f botica , b dean ; g purvis , w gatland , s mcdowell , i jones , g whetton ( capt ) , a whetton , k schuler , z brooke .
figure of fun open space ..
i write in response to judith raymont ( november 16 ) who wrote of the cartoon men â€” a user 's guide , â€˜ it is either insulting to men and should not be endorsed by publication , or it is witty and amusing , in which case we , a woman , have no right to complain about equivalent portrayal of female stereotype . â€™
it doe not matter if the cartoon is insulting to men .
the number of such cartoon is so small that , set against the insult to woman broadcast by every newsagent and television channel , only a loony masculist would object to them .
before raymont work towards â€˜ way of showing respect , understanding and affection to member of the opposite sex â€™ , she should realise that the opposite sex 's obsession with â€˜ member â€™ is a problem of enormous gravity .
there is nothing respectful , understanding or affectionate about page three .
w j gaskill ( male ) east kilbride
iwould agree that male and female stereotype portrayed in cartoon are equally abhorrent , were it not for the fact that , whilst one poke fun at a powerful group in society ( men ) , the other perpetuates the oppression of a powerless group ( woman ) .
in an ideal world , there would be no need for either , but for now i would rather see the frustration expressed in these light-hearted term than in the sort of man-hating bitterness that ha given feminism such a bad name .
natalie ford brighton
men â€” a user 's guide is stupid , negative and insulting .
am i , a a man , supposed to think that , if my body is hairy , it is â€˜ thick and bestial â€™ ?
or that my mind , which i consider intelligent and creative , is occupied only with sex , violence and car engine ?
is this funny ?
what kind of hypocrisy allows you to ( presumably ) condemn a similarly degrading portrayal of woman , whilst making your page a forum for this cartoon ?

soccer : littlewoods cup , fourth round : oldham athletic 3 , arsenal 1 double by ritchie end 66-year wait .
by stephen bierley
oldham athletic , who had never beaten a first division side since they dropped into the second division in 1923 , made up for 66 year of not altogether patient waiting with a pulsating victory over the league champion arsenal at boundary park last night .
the pennines fairly shook .
no supporter of the latics dared dream it , but suddenly the improbable wa a throbbing , joyous reality .
two goal from the irrepressible andy ritchie , his 13th and 14th this season , and a third by the 20-year-old midfield player nick henry , and arsenal were sunk with only the trace of a last-minute goal by quinn .
despite many and varied flurry of activity in the first 40 minute , arsenal seemed reasonably secure if not inspired .
they held their line and competed hard in midfield , damping down oldham 's initial verve and preparing themselves for more of the same in the second half .
then oldham struck .
winterburn almost put the ball into his own net from milligan 's cross , o'leary recovering an awkward situation .
almost immediately smith had an excellent chance for arsenal but stumbled .
oldham took up the attack again and barlow , who had a fine match at left-back , totally containing rocastle , floated in a deep cross beyond winterburn .
the predatory ritchie chested the ball down and hammered a volley past lukic .
arsenal had no choice but to attack a soon a the second half began .
a neat step-over by rocastle sent thomas hurtling in on goal but rhodes moved sharply off his line to smother the shot .
from the resulting corner rhodes made another fine save , hurtling to his right to deflect away dixon 's rising shot .
finally , with arsenal pressing hard , he clawed away quinn 's careful header from thomas 's drag-back .
quinn held his head in disbelief .
worse , far worse wa to follow .
bunn , who scored six goal in the previous round against scarborough , this time turned into the provider , putting milligan clear and free .
he wa hauled back on the edge of the area by o'leary , a â€˜ professional â€™ foul for which the arsenal central defender wa booked .
holden 's 64th-minute free-kick clattered the wall and the ball fell to henry , who drilled a low shot from more than 30 yard inside lukic 's right-hand post .
in another 10 minute any remaining oldham doubt were dispelled .
ritchie passed to irwin and then ran on to head the cross past lukic .
arsenal were stitched and stuffed , with no question of a fluke .
not for the first time this season their defence had been found wanting and oldham exploited the weakness to the full , owing a special debt to the inspiration and tireless running of henry and milligan .
george graham wa not amused .
he called his team 's performance â€˜ unacceptable â€™ .
but he also said : â€˜ let's not take any credit away from oldham .
they were tremendous , and outplayed u in the first half .
the plastic pitch is no excuse .
we trained on an artificial pitch for two day this week and we should have done a lot better . â€™
joe royle , the oldham manager , wa full of praise both for graham and his own team .
â€˜ george wa brilliant , â€™ he said .
â€˜ he could have blamed this and that but he said we deserved it .
the manager 's attitude show why they are champion .
he took it on the chin .
â€˜ one or two people will be ready to put this down to plastic but our goal were nothing to do with plastic .
this wa a great performanc .
we rattled them from the first minute and did n't give them any breathing space .
we were helter-skelter for 90 minute and we scored three great goal .
in the past we have had cup walk , not run . â€™

prototyping is crucial to system development , argues ian richards tailored to fit .
in system development nothing is more fundamental than assessing user requirement .
if you do n't know what the system is required to do ; you do n't know anything .
but many system developer are unable to ass requirement properly .
they seem to think that you can ask a businessman what his requirement are and get an answer that amount to a draft system specification .
a doctor doe n't ask his patient what treatment to prescribe .
the patient can explain only what the problem is .
it is the doctor that provides the remedy .
if you ask a user what sort of system he want you will be met with a blank look .
a user may have a deep knowledge of business problem , but knowing little about computer , ha no idea how they should be tackled .
yet , analyst are heard asking time and again , â€˜ tell me what you want .
we 've gone awaym_from the day of system imposed by the data processing department , this is going to be a system for the user . â€™
but of course the user do n't know what they want , so they end up getting another duff system .
an effective analyst provides the same service to the business a the doctor provides to the patient .
he find out what the need of the business are , and prescribes the cure .
the user tell the analyst what the problem are , and the analyst decides , at least in broad term , what the user requires .
but the analyst ha one great advantage over the doctor .
once the user becomes familiar with the proposed system , helpful comment come thick and fast .
â€˜ oh , this will be of great help in ordering raw material , but sometimes we get part delivery , could we have an extra facility to deal with those ?
and sometimes non-standard discount is given , a pig to deal with on the old system , but if you could add one extra input box on that screen there â€¦
and what about order not delivered on time ?
if we could list those we 'd have advance warning of shortage problem on the assembly line two month before they occur .
now that would be a great leap forward . â€™
unfortunately you can not reach this stage until you have developed a prototype system .
and you ca n't develop a prototype system because the user have n't got a clue what they want .
most of them are probably muttering , â€˜ i 'm too busy to get involved in this sort of thing .
what 's wrong with the old system anyway ? â€™
the only way to develop a prototype is for the analyst to get inside the head of the user and , thinking like a user , decide what sort of system is required .
of course , the initial system will not be perfect .
the analyst can not hope to understand the business a well in a few week a the user doe after many year .
but once the user see the system , channel of communication will open .
instead of persuading the user to specify requirement , the analyst will be driven by the user to meet key need .
good system development go through two distinct phase .
initially the analyst doe all the work , leading the user towards a system he think is right for the business .
but once the user see the potential of the system , a change in attitude take place .
the process becomes demand driven by the user .
the analyst is then forced on the defensive , explaining why new feature can not be included because they are technically difficult or prohibitively expensive .
traditionally , system were validated by user agreeing functional specification .
in theory , validation meant that the user had read the specification , imagined how the system would work in practice , and agreed the design .
it wa only when using a â€˜ test â€™ version of the system ( available just before the planned implementation date ) that difficulty would come to light , and a host of change request be issued .
the advent of fourth generation language ( 4gls ) ha made system development much easier .
with a 4gl an initial prototype can be put together quickly .
this mean feedback is obtained early in the development process , and the system can grow around the user 's requirement .
crucial to the development process is the relationship built up between the analyst and the user .
the best system arise when both have a deep understanding of each other 's job .
many developer use business analyst to ensure that the development team maintain a proper focus on business requirement .
but this can be counter-productive , a it cut off communication between the system analyst and the user .
too much specialisation is bad for system development ; it feed the temptation to get engrossed in technical difficulty and forget about the underlying business need .
if you should stroll into a pub and meet an analyst and a user talking about work , and you can not tell one from the other , they have probably developed a successful system together .

tiphook confident .
container group tiphook yesterday said it wa still confident of winning it joint â£643million bid for sea container even though the battle ha swung towards james sherwood 's ferries-to-trailers combine .
the offer from the anglo-swedish consortium formed by tiphook and stena ab is the subject of an appeal in the bermudan court which is aimed at overturning an earlier ruling allowing seaco to proceed with it â€˜ poison pill â€™ defence .
tiphook , which yesterday unveiled a 124 per cent increase in half year profit to â£10million , hope the court will block seaco 's purchase of it own share .
alternatively , it may be able to muster enough support from seaco shareholder to halt the current disposal of asset by mr sherwood for it bid with stena to be fully considered .
the cost of the bid to tiphook is put at â£2million , which it say will have only a minor impact on full year result .
increased demand for it road , rail and sea container fleet during the first half helped boost the latest figure .
this flowed through to earnings per share , up a half at 19.6p and shareholder receive a 25 per cent increase in the interim dividend to 2.7p .
the share rose 9p to 443p .
salvesen boost .
christian salvesen , the food process and distribution , generator hire and brick making group , raised pre-tax profit by almost 21 per cent to â£32.6million in the six month to september .
aggreko generator hire , salvesen 's world market leader which provides power for customer from pop concert to the oil industry , contributed strongly to a 37 per cent growth in trading profit in the industrial service division .
oil slick in alaska and elsewhere helped vikoma , the group 's environmental cleaning equipment manufacturer , which specialises in separating oil from water , and although salvesen brick , is suffering in the second half from a 30 to 40 per cent cut in demand a housebuilding nosedive , the first half wa prosperous and full year trading profit should be on a level with 1988 , say finance director brian fidler .
almost a third of group profit are earned overseas , interest and tax charge are down on last year and gearing stand at 13 per cent .
capital spending of â£43 million should reach a total of â£87 million for the full year .
the share rose 10p to 170p .
avon tread warily .
share in avon rubber have fallen sharply this year a a result of the weak demand for winter tyre and right issue call to finance the move into u motor component .
the sale of most of the lossmaking tyre distribution business to sumitomo , now also a minority shareholder in the only british-controlled tyremaker 's plant , give the board confidence in some improvement this year , despite a poor immediate outlook for the motor producer .
pre-tax profit fell â£4.1million to â£12.2 million in the year to september 30 , in line with the severely-reduced expectation after the cadillac rubber acquisition and right issue in july .
turnover wa held at â£228.6million , an rise of about â£2million , by the earlier contribution from tyre distribution and the u replacement .
the final dividend go up to 11.5p , making 16.5p , against 14p for the year .
earnings crashed by a third to 41p .
there wa an extraordinary gain of â£13.4 million , covering the motorway tyre disposal and more rationalisation cost .
in short â€¦
whessoe saw pre-tax profit rise to â£4.78 million , from â£3.55 million , on sale of â£58 million down from â£100 million .
earnings were level at 17.5p a share .
dividend total 5p , up a penny , with a 3.75p final .
btp 's enlarged specialist chemical activity boosted turnover to â£60.1million , from â£44.8million , in the september half and profit rose to â£9.6 million from â£5.6 million , including an exceptional â£3.1 million , from the rizzi engineering sale in italy .
earnings without such gain were 1.9p higher at 6.8p a share .
the interim dividend is 2.75p , a rise of 10 per cent .
norcros , the property , building material and printing group , saw profit crash from â£29million to â£18.3million .
however , the city had been expecting bad figure and the share rose 15p to 239p .
hardanger , the retail property developer , posted pre-tax profit up â£1.3million to â£8.37million .
the final dividend is 26.5p , making a total of 37.5p , against 30p .
crystalate , the electronics product group , experienced a â€˜ serious disappointment â€™ in the second half and hence profit fell from â£5.6million to â£2.9million in the year to september .
the market .
kingfisher 's â£461million bid for dixon 's led to a resurgence of speculative activity yesterday .
dixons ' share jumped to 153p in early trading but ended the day at 141p , a 22p rise .
other recently depressed store , and company with business similar to dixons , rose in sympathy .
gu a were particularly prominent at 1118p , up 28p ahead of today 's interim figure .
property continued to shine a british land produced a complicated scheme to release the value of it property portfolio .
british land closed at 405p , a net gain of 48p .

edoardo amaldi .
ragazzi of distinction : .
in december , 1943 , the men working feverishly to create the first american atomic bomb sent a team of â€˜ spook â€™ to naples .
one of their main assignment wa to contact edoardo amaldi , a physicist thought to be in hiding near rome .
six month later , the day before rome 's liberation by the ally , amaldi wa found .
he wa interviewed by moe berg , then one of the most famous baseball player in america .
berg wa also an agent of the office of strategic service , which wa later to give birth to the cia .
his job wa to convince amaldi to pack his bag because there wa a ship waiting at naples to take him to the united state .
amaldi 's presence there had been sought by two other italian colleague , also physicist .
his mentor , enrico fermi , later to be called â€˜ the father of the bomb â€™ , and emilio segre ( who died in california earlier this year ) .
amaldi dodged the american invitation , perhaps because ( with rome liberated ) fermi 's mantle in physic had fallen on his young shoulder and there were younger mind to teach .
he wore that mantle well at rome university until his retirement in 1978 .
but amaldi never really retired nor grew old .
he kept regular hour in the university 's physic building , spoke at scientific meeting this year in moscow and washington .
a president of the accademia nazionale dei lincei he had delivered the welcoming address on tuesday to a symposium of scientist .
he then ordered a car to call for him the next morning for a similar occasion and wa felled by a stroke while waiting for the lift .
amaldi grew up in a small town in lombardy , and took his doctorate in physic from rome at the remarkably early age of 21 .
in 1929 , he became one of the ragazzi di via panisperna â€” the street where fermi 's â€˜ kid â€™ carried out their own experiment under the master in their own under-financed lab .
emilio segre wa one kid , and bruno pontecorvo , later to defect from britain to the soviet union , another .
it is interesting to note that the â€˜ pope â€™ â€” a the kid called fermi â€” â€˜ because he 's always right â€™ , wa only seven year older than amaldi .
amaldi astounded his group in october 1934 with his discovery that by slowing down , rather than accelerating , neutron , he could provoke intense nuclear reaction .
he held a chair in physic from 1937 until his retirement publishing more than 150 paper on atomic and nuclear physic .
he wa awarded honorary degree by algiers , glasgow and oxford .
he became a founder , and active executive , of the european centre for nuclear research in geneva .
i had the pleasure of two long talk last year with professor amaldi about his knowledge of what the german physicist were doing with their atom during the war year .
apart for his incongruously white hair , amaldi seemed to have the mental lucidity and expected energy of a man half his age .
his modesty , considering his world-wide fame in his field , wa endearing .
i knew almost nothing about physic but we shared some joke about the rome telephone system .
in 1949 , amaldi wrote to the italian prime minister asking for permission to produce and sell sealing wax for letter , â€˜ so that we may raise needed fund for our physic lab â€™ .
the reply came from an under-secretary who said that the present funding wa considered adequate and the commercial undertaking would be ill-advised .
it wa signed by giulio andreotti , the present prime minister .
george armstrong edoardo amaldi , born carpaneto piacentino september 5 , 1908 ; died rome , december 5 , 1989 .
midwife at the birth of a state .
the intifada is a people 's unarmed revolution against occupation .
it two main slogan , repeated countless time in the directive issued by the underground leadership , are freedom and independence .
it ha employed a dual strategy to achieve these two objective .
first , a comprehensive civil disobedience campaign wa begun by which people severed , or minimised , all the contact point by which they were bound to the israeli occupation authority .
this campaign included resignation of palestinian official from public post , the boycott of israeli good and product , and the refusal to pay tax and fine .
partial and full strike , demonstration , sit-in , convention â€¦ all these have in fact only constituted the outer layer of an inner mechanism of civilian rebellion .
the second , and complementary , part of the intifada strategy concentrated on the construction of an indigenous national authority .
a israel 's authority wa being lifted , the population began creating an alternative authority of their own .
popular committee were established in village , refugee camp , suburb , street , in fact in every community .
some headway wa made in expanding self-sufficiency , whether through utilising more land for agriculture , developing home economy , or encouraging local manufacturer and product .
village and refugee camp were thus being developed into â€˜ liberated â€™ or â€˜ independent â€™ area , if not militarily , then at least psychologically , politically and infrastructurally .
bloody clash would occur whenever armoured unit raided these village , storming through makeshift defensive road block and responding to rock being thrown with live bullet and tear gas ; but no sooner would these army unit be gone than authority would revert to the village resident .
palestinian flag would be raised on minaret and church spire , road block would again be erected , and life in all it aspect would once again be run by the local leadership .
the structure of the developing national authority ha been both diffuse enough to prevent it from being destroyed by any one single sweep of arrest ( there have been more than 50,000 arrest since the intifada 's outbreak ) , and coherent enough to allow for the existence of a unified resistance strategy .
while the entire network of popular committee , local institution and the general public constitute the field commander in the battle of civilian disobedience and of constructing a political infrastructure , a rotating unified national command act in the role of field-general , issuing a bi-monthly directive outlining policy and determining specific resistance programme .
a high level of mobility in the structure allows for continuous interchange of role and idea , and retains for the unified national command the closeness to grass root that is required to make it truly reflect people 's wish and sentiment .
this expanded network of popular committee and institution making up the unified leadership is infused by ten of thousand of activist who belong to , or identify with , the different faction of the plo .
in effect , therefore , the plo exists at all level of organisation within the occupied territory .
thus the palestinian national movement both inside and outside the occupied territory is an organic whole .
the pattern of the intifada ha been cyclical .
thrust of resistance ( mass demonstration , resignation , tax rebellion , etc ) would come in crest .
the pattern is determined by a wide variety of factor , including what the israeli army doe .
but the relation is complex , not uni-directional .
harsh measure â€” putting an entire community under an absolute curfew for a continuous lengthy period of time , demolishing home , uprooting olive or citrus tree , physical intimidation and terror tactic employed by raiding army unit , shooting , killing , cutting off water or electricity supply and telephone link to village or town , mass arrest , intimidatory interrogation technique â€” can either create a temporary lull or activate an eruption .
the army never know which it will be .
it is a if it is walking through a minefield .
the wave-like pattern of the intifada , it pain and suffering , are all reminiscent of the process of birth .
the metaphor is apt , a palestinian regard themselves a engaging in a process of giving birth to their independent palestinian state .
through their revolution , the mass are both mother and midwife to the birth of this state .
the intifada is the midwife of freedom .
through it , palestinian are struggling on a daily basis to shake off israel 's authority and to construct their own .
the struggle reflects a revolution in mass consciousness , by which people have come to realise that idea and aspiration must be embodied in manifest act if reality is to be changed .
thus , wherever one look , one find people engaged in the construction of the block that will make up the palestinian state .
it is a conscious effort .
the mass are being engaged in the craft of state-masonry .
in this process of state building , many stage have been covered .
the declaration of independence issued by the palestine national council ( pnc ) on november 15 last year constitutes a major landmark along this road .
it significance lie in it double message : that the aim of the palestinian struggle is the establishment of palestinian independence , and that this independence is regarded a being not at israel 's expense .
this ha been a constant theme of intifada policy : that we wish to build ( palestine ) , not to destroy ( israel ) ; that we wish to achieve freedom ( for our people ) , not to deprive others ( israeli ) of it ; that we wish to protect and save life ( ours ) , not to endanger the life of others ( israeli ) .
in one of several intifada leaflet written in hebrew and addressed to the israeli soldier on duty in the occupied territory , the message wa repeated : soldier , go home .
return to your family and child .
be with them in peace so that we may remain with our family and child in peace .
we do not wish to harm you , or your state .
we wish to be unharmed , in our own state .
how can the process of state building be developed ?
if the pnc declaration of independence constituted a major landmark in this process , the time ha come to embark on another major step , that of declaring the setting up of a state or government structure .
an escalation of the intifada in this direction would serve two purpose at once .
first , it would consolidate the structure of the developing national authority which is competing to replace the occupation authority .
second , it would consolidate the image and essence of the intifada a a constructive , not a destructive , force .
naturally , to embark on such a step is not necessarily to succeed immediately in realising it .
rather , it is a challenge .
it will be a further challenge to israel 's occupation , conceived in the image of earlier challenge of the intifada .
but it will also be a challenge to u , palestinian , summoning u to work more energetically towards the idea 's fulfilment .
it would be a natural extension of the intifada 's dual strategy towards disengagement from israel , and the corresponding process of state building .
it would further naturalise and legitimise the evolving skeletal form of palestinian independence .
it would provide the multitudinous popular committee and activity with a more advanced form of organisation and structure .
it would enable better planning and performance .
it would maximise civilian tactic of resistance and defuse the natural potential for violence , containing and eventually eliminating the marginal but intrusive phenomenon of collaborator activation by israeli security authority and collaborator execution by local palestinian .
it would create a further fact that would put israel on the spot .
israel 's reaction , however hostile , could only further our cause .
arresting or deporting the ten of thousand of palestinian professional who would be employed in perfectly apolitical , harmless and humanitarian job can only further isolate the israeli government .
half-way measure can only imply half-way success .
a modus vivendi would also imply success .
in general , our policy should be to proceed with building our state block by block , without waiting to be given a gift of it through negotiation .
we should regard negotiation rather a the mean by which we could establish formal agreement between our state and israel .
such agreement can range from the issue of border to the issue of free wave-lengths for our future television and radio network .
in the meantime , we have the capacity to bring coherence and organisation to a whole range of activity , further consolidating the institutional linkage between the people in the occupied state and the plo leadership .
entire department can be set up , in health , foreign affair , agriculture , trade , finance , education , justice , religion , information and social welfare .
a pyramid administrative structure , establishing link from popular committee in village right up to the executive committee of the plo ( in it capacity a a cabinet ) , can be established .
during the intifada the people have been engaged in building the side wall .
a government would provide the roof which would bring these wall together .
it would add another necessary touch in the process of creating a palestinian home .

â€˜ the palestinian national movement inside and outside the occupied territory is an organic whole â€™ photograph : david sillitoe
the boy and the dog skirted round opposite side of the puddle , the boy , a light , tall fourteen-year-old , labouring in wellington boot too large for him , and the dog , a three-year-old labrador bitch , picking her way reluctantly , with frequent pause , a if her paw hurt .
the boy , unlike the dog , knew that the mud did not go on for ever ; beyond the bridge , the disused railway embankment along which they were walking became built up , so that water ran off it .
he pulled the dog close to him to let a mixed string of horse and pony go past , waving shyly to the lead rider , a pretty , capable girl an unbridgeable two year older than him .
he watched her a she went past at a walk , the black labrador and he both gazing wistfully , their breath steaming in the cold february morning .
he waited till the horse were well away and looked round the wide , flat landscape carefully before unclipping the lead .
â€˜ way you go , patty , â€™ he said softly , and the dog wa off , hurling herself along the embankment , all paw and flying ear , after a rabbit who had been sitting in a patch of sun but disappeared with contemptuous ease a she came close .
the boy had been told unequivocally not to let her off the lead â€” the riding-school only used the land by grace of it owner and it wa a shooting estate â€” but he hated keeping the dog straining at the lead and knew that she would always come to his call .
he stood for a moment laughing at her a she cast furiously for the vanished rabbit , and walked on , to catch her up , along the raised embankment .
the tree had grown up beside it in the twenty-five year since the railway had closed , and the boy stopped every now and then to watch small bird hopping around the top branch .
he particularly liked this stretch ; nothing but the odd tractor and the horse ever came down this embankment , and the bird were unworried by his presence .
after half a mile he decided to turn off the embankment and walk up the side of the next field and along the path at the top of it , following the horse whom he could still see in the distance .
he called patty to him .
she did n't come , which wa surprising ; she wa a docile creature and particularly devoted to him because he always took her for a walk when he wa at the stable .
he could hear her barking and looked down over the steep side of the embankment to the bottom of the tree .
he called her again and again , but she would not stop barking at something he could not see .
probably a squirrel , he decided , and slithered down the side of the embankment to join her , scolding a he went .
straightening up beside the dog , he looked where she wa looking , and blinked .
he saw a leg , uncomfortably wedged between sapling tree , swollen grotesquely , and gazed at it , stupidly , wondering if it wa plastic .
a his eye focused he realized he wa looking at a hideously swollen human body , and just then , a the light breeze shifted , he caught the stomach-turning odour of decay .
he wa a sensible and capable boy , an eldest child , so he moved closer , trying not to breathe , and stood steadfastly looking until he wa confident of what he had seen : a body , must be a girl because it wa wearing a skirt , lying face down , head towards the bottom of the embankment a if she had dived off the top .
he clipped the lead on to the dog with cold hand which would hardly function , and let her pull him up the slope a fast a he could make his leg move .
he stopped on the embankment , shaking with cold and shock , to note the spot , then fled along the tractor path , the dog running with him , to the stable where the ten o'clock child 's ride wa in it closing stage .
â€˜ miss williams ! â€™
â€˜ jamie , i 'm teaching . â€™
the thin , capable woman who wa taking the riding-class looked at him in amazement a he leaned panting on the gate to the ring , the dog whining beside him .
â€˜ i 'm sorry .
please , i 've found something , i must tell you .
she had known him since he wa a very small five-year-old , perched like a mosquito on one of the placid beginner ' pony , so she told the class to carry on walking their pony while she came to him .
â€˜ there 's someone dead .
below the railway embankment . â€™
â€˜ are you sure ? â€™
the boy looked at her and uncontrollable tear suddenly filled his eye .
he wa very nearly a tall a her , but she put an arm under his shoulder and supported him to the untidy room which served a the stable office , calling to one of the stable girl to take over the class .
â€˜ patty found her .
she 's just lying there , but she is dead . â€™
he scrubbed at his face with the handkerchief she offered and gulped for air .
â€˜ i 'll ring the police . â€™
she did so , casting an experienced eye over him .
â€˜ sit down here , jamie , and i 'll make some tea .
mummy will come back in a few minute , wo n't she , for susie ? â€™
â€˜ not mummy .
aunt margaret is coming at ten . â€™
the boy thought longingly of his mother , but managed to help miss williams describe the location of the body to a startled local station sergeant and to drink a cup of sweet milky tea without being sick .
by the time his aunt arrived jamie wa so far recovered a to be able to refuse to go home and to point out , severely , that he would be needed , either to assist the police or to be lead rider in the eleven-thirty class , or possibly both .
he watched his aunt and miss williams wordlessly consult each other , but knew his aunt would do a she wa told ; successful solicitor though she wa , she wa ten year younger than miss williams and , a she complained , totally intimidated by her a she had not been by anyone since her late headmistress .
he wa unsurprised to find her packed off firmly to take his sister home , leaving him a a person of major importance in what he instantly assumed to be a real murder .
miss williams took him to meet the police land rover at the stable gate , a bone-thin , wiry woman in her late fifty , her expression sufficiently forbidding to prevent the parent , edging car through the gate to collect child from the ten o'clock ride , from asking any question .
jamie , through a renewed queasiness , just observed that the police driver wa instantly reduced to half his age by miss williams 's greeting .
â€˜ he wa one of my boy , â€™ she said in explanation to the cid sergeant who wa leading the party a they bumped over the rough road , through the thick mud and on to the dry embankment .
â€˜ like jamie here . â€™
â€˜ did you recognize the person you found , young man ? â€™ the sergeant asked , carefully .
â€˜ no . â€™
tear started into jamie 's eye .
â€˜ she wa all swollen . â€™
the sergeant 's eye widened , and he slid out of the land rover and stood back to let jamie out .
â€˜ very competent boy .
almost a professional singer , handle himself very well . â€™
miss williams 's natural pitch , well suited to reaching across a hunting-field , wa discreetly reduced .
the cid sergeant thanked her gravely and went to stand beside jamie who wa peering down the embankment , looking pinched .
â€˜ we 'll go down together , lad . â€™
â€˜ there is n't room .
i 'll lead . â€™
he took a deep breath and headed down , the sergeant , two constable and miss williams in his wake .
soon they all stood side by side , one of the younger policeman coughing involuntarily .
â€˜ oh dear , oh dear , â€™ miss williams said on an indrawn breath .
â€˜ sorry .
come along , jamie , let's get you back . â€™
she took out a handkerchief and mopped her eye .
the police driver shot jamie a look of enquiry which he missed , occupied a he wa with guiding miss williams back up the hill .
he had seen her weep before but only for a sick horse , and he wa awe-struck .
â€˜ jamie , did you let patty off the lead ? â€™
the boy blushed to his ear and owned to it .
â€˜ you must not do it , jamie , we 'll be in trouble with colonel james , i 've told all you boy a thousand time . â€™
â€˜ he 'll perhaps not do it again , â€™ the sergeant murmured , and received the look that miss williams habitually bent on a child who wa riding carelessly .
â€˜ how long had she been there ? â€™
jamie asked , anxiously .
â€˜ a few day , â€™ the sergeant said , grimly .
â€˜ how many ? â€™
â€˜ doctor 'll tell u . â€™
he considered the boy thoughtfully , and decided to take him back quickly .
these teenager were in his experience a lot le tough than they looked .
â€˜ any idea who it could be ? â€™ he asked miss williams casually .
â€˜ no .
but only a local would know to put a body there .
if jamie had n't let the dog off the lead she could have been there much longer . â€™
the sergeant nodded , deciding it could do no harm to concede a point he had already taken .
â€˜ no one could tell who she wa , surely ? â€™
miss williams said quietly to him , sounding shaky .
â€˜ she did n't even look human . â€™
the sergeant confirmed that that happened with body after a few day .
â€˜ we 'll identify her , though , â€™ he said , reassuringly .
â€˜ somebody will likely have reported her missing . â€™
he stopped , abruptly , a he remembered a conversation earlier that week , and lit a cigarette , thinking furiously .
this could be the girl whom the yard were looking for , and he had better do everything very quickly indeed , including finding his chief , who would then want to find his chief constable and notify scotland yard .
presumably it would be the yard who investigated this one , rather than the regional crime squad .
he chewed his thumbnail a he walked , out of long experience keeping in mind the highest priority : ensure body not moved and ensure next of kin notified before the press got the story .
he posted the detective constable he had with him back down the path to join his colleague , armed with instruction to repel all attempt by anyone , however senior or armed with whatever authority , to go anywhere near the body unless he , sergeant black , personally accompanied them .
then he climbed into the land rover beside his two passenger and drove off fast , with the aim of abandoning jamie to the custody of his aunt a quickly a possible .
he could see with half an eye that the kid 's aunt wa going to be one of the confident , bossy , well-connected woman with whom that part of cambridgeshire wa substantially over-provided .
john mcleish wa in his office , saturday or no saturday , telling himself he needed to catch up on the paperwork .
the phone rang and he picked it up , frowning .
one of the pleasure of saturday working wa that the phone did not ring all the time .
the voice at the other end wa plainly over-excited and it took him a minute to disentangle what he wa being told .
â€˜ oh congratulation , charlie .
sorry , what did you say it wa again ? â€™
â€˜ a little girl .
actually a very big girl a these thing go , nine pound .
it 's fantastic , john , there she is , a new person , lying on her face , sound asleep .
i 've just left them and i 'm going back . â€™
mcleish repressed the malicious thought that this event might put francesca 's nose just a little bit out of joint .
she had been utterly secure in her position a the only girl in the wilson family and now there wa another one .
â€˜ i 've got another bit of good news .
frannie 's going to be able to bring tristram home pretty soon , apparently . â€™
mcleish expressed qualified enthusiasm and charlie assured him he felt exactly the same about his younger brother .
â€˜ the difficulty is that perry doe everything that bit better than tristram .
not that this is any excuse , john , i do know . â€™
he paused , reminding mcleish irresistibly of a labrador wondering how best to approach an acquaintance .
â€˜ i wanted to say , you see , that i know you thought frannie should n't have gone , and that it 's ruined your holiday plan , and , on behalf of u all , i 'm sorry .
i know the little boy lean on her too much and i would have gone if i could . â€™
he coughed , embarrassed and a little pompous , very much conscious of his new status a a father , while mcleish remembered that he wa a scant four year older than the delinquent tristram .
â€˜ anyway she should be back soon , â€™ charlie concluded .
mcleish thanked him gravely , feeling , a he often did with the wilson , that he wa being enveloped in a large feather eiderdown , and , made restless by the call , went down the corridor to where he knew catherine crane wa also in , getting her office in order .
he stopped at the door and smiled at her .
wearing jean and a blue shirt , she wa tugging at a filing cabinet which wa too large for her to embrace and which wa threatening to over-balance on her .
she looked about sixteen and beautiful .
she let go of the cabinet , coughing in the dust of age that appeared to be lurking behind it , and smiled back at him a the february sun shone through the small window behind her , throwing into sharp relief the patch on the wall where her predecessor had hung poster , and the ingrained dirt on the flaking paintwork round the mean , narrow , metal window .
â€˜ where do you want that put ? â€™
mcleish advanced on the cabinet and shifted it authoritatively , ignoring the clip on the ankle dealt him by an unsecured bottom drawer apparently full of brick .
â€˜ i should have unloaded it first , â€™ catherine crane said , apologetically , â€˜ but i just could n't move in any direction with it where it wa . â€™
â€˜ i 'm here , just tell me if you want anything else shifted . â€™
he hesitated .
â€˜ i 'm going to do another hour , then have some lunch , if you want to come ? â€™
he wa aware that he wa not managing to sound exactly like a senior officer making a recent arrival feel at home , but decided not to add any further rider to his invitation .
â€˜ that would be very nice .
are we going to the canteen ? â€™
â€˜ not if i can help it .
what about the pub ?
â€˜ if i 'm allowed to buy my own . â€™
mcleish considered .
â€˜ that 's fine on the food â€” i 'll buy the drink , i 'm too old to get used to woman buying my drink . â€™
she laughed at him and said gravely that she would be happy to indulge him , and he went away , grinning .
peter yeo wa also in his office , having told his wife he wa lunching with a client .
it wa , he felt , just too difficult to be at home at all , with claudia in a permanently bitchy mood and both his teenage child taking their cue from her and behaving intolerably .
he wandered restlessly about , and decided that the lie might a well become the truth .
without angela morgan , at least two major client were in danger of not getting the assiduous service they were paying for , and it would be well worth trying to see if one of them , whom he knew to be a fellow refugee from family life at the weekend , could be found .
he wa in luck , and fixed to meet andy barton at brazzo 's where yeo davis had a table permanently booked .
he had to admit that this particular client hardly added to the general decorative smartness of the place .
andy barton , founder and chief executive of barton textile , wa almost a broad a he wa long , virtually neckless , with incongruously long brown hair curling over his collar .
his enormous hand dwarfed the elegant menu which he wa studying in apparent disbelief , and peter yeo noticed again , a barton without rising extended one massive paw , that though the finger were an ordinary length it wa the width of the palm that made the hand so large .
â€˜ i never see how they get the sale per square foot in these place , â€™ barton observed , without further greeting .
â€˜ i mean , they 're not open twelve hour like my shop , and they are n't using the space . â€™
his small bright blue eye swept disparagingly over the minimalized black and white flooring , stainless steel chair and black wooden bar .
â€˜ they make a huge margin on a smaller turnover , andy , out of punter like u . â€™
peter yeo wa amused by , and respectful of , a man with an obsession .
â€˜ angela not working today ? â€™
barton worked a sixteen-hour day , which began with careful , detailed consideration of the trading figure and key ratio for every one of his forty-three major shop and the output of both factory , and continued , usually by helicopter , with a detailed aerial survey of a particular area a the quick way of identifying new site , interspersed with unheralded descent on the manager of any shop he took a fancy to visit .
peter yeo , who had known this particular juggernaut since he had his first small factory and two store and dirt under his fingernail from shifting packing-cases personally , wa not fazed by the question .
â€˜ angela 's taking a few day off â€” she ha n't been well , â€™ he said , easily .
â€˜ i know she 's been working very hard for you .
i 'm up to speed with huerter , of course , but is your planning application in leicester all right ? â€™
barton assured him warmly that angela had done a great job and he wa now confident of getting planning permission on the vast site he had wanted .
peter yeo , who knew him in this over-candid , over-emphatic mood , decided to prod gently .
â€˜ angela said the council wanted it for housing ? â€™
â€˜ yeah , some of them did .
silly bugger , it 's job they want there first .
plenty of housing if those stupid fart at the council got round to repairing it and stopped their tenant tearing apart what they have got .
my mum brought up five of u in a flat far worse than what these immigrant complain about . â€™
peter yeo , who had personally persuaded barton of the presentational disadvantage of using word like â€˜ darky â€™ , â€˜ nigger â€™ or â€˜ wog â€™ , decided that â€˜ immigrant â€™ even though used in the manner of one invoking a curse , wa a good a he wa going to get with this particular client .
â€˜ she 's doing a good job on sorting this huerter thing , too .
bloody ridiculous them bloke at the dti pushing assistance for huerter .
i voted for this government because they said they were n't going to go in for that sort of rubbish .
no one ever gave me anything and my business work .
still , angie can fix the treasury on this one , given her boyfriend , ca n't she ?
that 's the reason i wanted you on this . â€™
peter yeo winced inwardly , but he wa not going to tell andy barton that angela wa missing , or express any of his reservation about how much influence angela could bring to bear .
he smoothly changed the subject to the look of the blond model , three table away , and barton agreed he would n't mind a bit of that ; on the thin side , mind you , but tasty .
the rest of lunch passed in similar diversion , interspersed with detail of last week 's turnover which were never far from barton 's mind , whatever other distraction offered .
mr huntley wa having lunch with her daughter .
she ate placidly , acknowledging to herself with her customary good sense that at the moment , a at any time since her brother william had died , she and penelope were getting no pleasure at all from each other 's company .
penelope wa looking particularly discontented and disaffected , picking at her food .
her red suit wa smart , but too bright a colour for her pale english pink and white skin , her brown hair could have done with a wash and her nail were ragged and bitten .
she wa frowning , deep line appearing between her eyebrow , mouth drawn down at the edge so that instead of a classically good-looking slim english rose in her late twenty , she looked faded , year older than her real age , and shrewish .
mr huntley sighed ; her brother whom she had loved , but knew to be self-indulgent to a fault , had done his niece real harm by leaving so much of his money away from the girl who had confidently believed herself to be his favourite thing on earth .
penelope , however , it had to be acknowledged , had made no attempt to rise above the blow she had been dealt by finding a dazzling girl of her own age favoured over herself in her uncle 's will .
at least , mr huntley thought hopefully , she had stopped wondering , unbecomingly and stridently , how her uncle could have been fooled by angela morgan .
it wa grizel huntley 's own view that her brother had not been fooled at all but had been charmed and diverted by a dashing girl thirty year his junior , and had seen no reason at all why she should not have a share of his considerable estate when that left a very decent down-setting for his niece a well .
indeed , she had respected angela morgan for the straightforwardness with which she had tackled the issue when they had met at the lawyer 's office .
â€˜ i 'm sorry you 're disappointed , â€™ she had said to penelope , â€˜ but after all there 's a lot of money , quite enough for both of u . â€™
so there wa , grizel huntley acknowledged , and it would be a great deal better if penny could manage to think a bit more positively .
â€˜ if she ha vanished , i 'm going to see that solicitor about whether i can get her presumed dead . â€™
penny , sounding childishly , sullenly determined , broke into her mother 's thought .
grizel huntley looked across at her , shocked .
â€˜ i would wait a little if i were you . â€™
penelope glared at her , turning an ungraceful scarlet , but mr huntley held her ground .
â€˜ you are being silly about this , penny .
you are letting this disappointment â€” and that 's all it is , you 're still a very well-off young woman â€” get in the way of everything . â€™
penelope choked on her pudding and started to cry , angry , uncontrollable tear .
grizel huntley reached out to comfort her but she forced back her chair and fled , clutching her handbag and napkin , leaving her mother with the ruin of lunch .
fifty mile north , sarah morgan had just finished serving a lunch that no one had done more than pick at .
her husband francis had made a slightly better showing than her daughter jennifer , who wa looking particularly ragged .
mother and daughter were very like each other , tall , dark , slim , pleasant-looking woman with mid-brown curly hair and slightly snub nose .
francis morgan , by contrast , wa dark , almost black-haired , sallow-skinned , with bright brown eye .
of medium height and packed with energy , even distressed a he wa , he wa bursting round the kitchen , hair still damp at the back from his swim .
â€˜ let's go to the flick .
no point at all sitting round looking at each other .
come on jennifer â€” or are you going out with michael ? â€™
â€˜ he 's gone back to australia , dad .
last week . â€™
jennifer sounded defeated , and he looked at her sideways with familiar love and exasperation .
she just did n't seem to be able to hang on to men , he thought impatiently , not like his angie , wherever she wa .
â€˜ giles rang up , â€™ his daughter volunteered , and he wa uncomfortably reminded by something in her voice that giles hawick wa one of the men jennifer had n't been able to hang on to â€” or not once he had seen angela .
â€˜ how wa he ? â€™ his wife sarah asked , rather too quickly .
â€˜ well , very worried .
he said the police were talking to everyone angie had seen in the two week before she â€¦ well â€¦ vanished , and so far had come up with nothing .
i mean no one noticed anything unusual about her and she seemed to be full of plan for the wedding . â€™
â€˜ well , i told them that , â€™ francis morgan said irritably and his wife and daughter caught each other 's eye in silent agreement that he had n't told them that angela wa refusing point-black to be married from home and wa insisting on the full london set-out , reception at the house of common , replying unanswerably when he had objected on ground of expense that she could well afford to pay for it herself .
a row of epic proportion had ensued , which he and angela had evidently enjoyed but which had left sarah and jennifer sick with distress .
â€˜ i do n't want to go out , frank .
someone might ring . â€™
sarah morgan wa sounding diffident but resolute , and a morgan opened his mouth to protest in exasperation the doorbell rang .
both woman looked at him in joint appeal and he marched to the door , pulling it open with unnecessary force .
he stood , door in hand , checked by something in the way his visitor , a man and a woman , were standing .
the man , a stocky , greying fifty-year-old in a navy raincoat over a suit , his hair cut short , wa attended by a uniformed policewoman , hair smartly set under the cap , her eye watchful in the wide , flat , placid face , and both of them were standing square and stolid .
francis morgan stood and stared at them , and even before the man stepped forward steadily , hand extended , mouth opening to speak , he understood who they were and what they had come to tell him .
mark sander returned from istanbul feeling exhausted , depressed and ill .
the blinding headache he had been experiencing in recent week were taking their toll , and he looked grey and drawn when he arrived home .
lately , georgina had been worried by the general deterioration in his appearance .
but now she wa visibly shocked by the drained and haggard-looking face which kissed her .
she wanted to say , â€˜ you look awful , darling , â€™ but decided against it .
â€˜ what kind of a trip have you had ? â€™ she asked instead .
â€˜ oh , not too bad , â€™ he replied wearily .
she took his suitcase and placed it at the bottom of the stair .
â€˜ come into the kitchen , and we will have a cup of tea .
i 'm_ve so much news to tell you .
all sort of thing seem to have happened while you have been away this time . â€™
mark smiled thinly and kissed her affectionately on the cheek .
â€˜ tell me about it , â€™ he replied .
â€˜ i could do with a good laugh . â€™
â€˜ why darling ?
what 's the matter ?
trouble at t'mill ? â€™
mark slipped an arm around her slim waist a they walked from the hall into the kitchen .
â€˜ perhaps it 's old montezuma 's revenge , â€™ he replied .
â€˜ must be getting too old for this globe-trotting lark , or else my mis-spent youth is catching up on me .
i 'm rapidly coming to the conclusion that this is a young man 's game . â€™
â€˜ nonsense , mark .
you 're still a young man â€¦ well , youngish. â€™ she said , trying to tease him out of his apparent lethargy and depression .
â€˜ let's have that cup of tea and you 'll feel better . â€™
â€˜ ah , fill the cup , what boot it to repeat , how time is slipping underneath our foot , â€™ he quoted with a sigh .
â€˜ oh darling .
what a sad sack we are today .
is that how you feel ?
shall i accompany you on the violin ?
now let me tell you all the news . â€™
she poured the tea .
â€˜ christopher ha been promoted after only one year .
the chairman of the company told him he wa most impressed with the contribution he 's made to the business , and that he could go right to the top if he keep it up .
i knew you 'd be delighted to hear that . â€™
she sipped her tea .
â€˜ next â€¦
i 've found a super husband for harriet .
champion of the breed at crufts last year .
life in the next village , believe it or not .
absolutely magnificent dog . â€™
â€˜ lucky harriet , â€™ said mark .
â€˜ what else ?
ah yes ; a secretary at the ministry of industry want you to ring him .
seems they want you to address the european commission on european industrial development .
in dublin , i think she said .
something about the factor which influence multi-nat location decision .
anyway , you 'll know what it mean when you see it .
i 've written it all down .
oh and yes â€¦ a chap from conservative central office rang up to say they 'd like to know if you would be prepared to stand for the european parliament .
he sounded somewhat to the right of genghis khan .
i said i did n't think so , a you were rather busy , but i 'd pas the message on .
hope i did the right thing .
i said you never knew where you were from one week to the next .
he said that would do nicely .
just like the american express advertisement .
perfect credential apparently , for european parliamentarian .
â€˜ now what next ?
the chicheley-smythes have bought an absolutely super villa in sardinia and say we could rent it if we 'd like to .
i 've seen the photograph .
gorgeous location overlooking a quiet bay .
it sleep ten with a permanent staff of three .
only a thousand pound a week , yacht included .
i 'd love that for two or three week , would n't you ? â€™
â€˜ we would n't want to stint ourselves , â€™ mark said facetiously , â€˜ four or five , i should think â€¦ . â€™
â€˜ and we could take the family , â€™ she said .
â€˜ we have n't had a family holiday for year .
i 'd like that .
but we can talk about that later .
and i 've decided to take up riding again .
do n't ask me why .
just got the urge , that 's all . â€™
she gave him a beautiful smile , which lit her lovely face .
â€˜ well , how 's that for starter ? â€™ she asked .
he had heard that expression before .
â€˜ is there more ? ,
â€˜ now let me see .
ah , yes â€¦
andrew 's coming home for the weekend so i thought it would be nice to have a drink party .
i 've invited the bunker , if that 's all right .
i like clem and gwen and the girl would be nicer company for andrew . â€™
â€˜ fine , â€™ agreed mark without much enthusiasm .
â€˜ if clem can make it , that is .
i heard about this latest merseyside strike in istanbul .
could finish off the uk vehicle division , â€™ he said forlornly , â€˜ and don peter , â€™ he added , shaking his head .
some of the stupid bastard wo n't be satisfied until we no longer make a single vehicle in the uk .
then i suppose they 'll say it 's all management 's fault , and people will believe them .
and who the hell is management ? â€™ he demanded , his voice rising .
â€˜ people like me , who 've worked their gut out to expand the business while the militant bastard have been working their gut out to destroy it . â€™
georgina wa nodding agreement .
she patted his wrist .
â€˜ i 'm quite sure you 're right , dear .
but we were n't talking about the motor industry and the never-ending management-union saga .
we were talking about andrew coming home for the weekend and having the bunker round for drink .
and i do wish you would n't swear like that when you talk about business .
you never used to swear , you know .
at least , you did n't when you were with me .
but you do now , darling , and i do wish you would n't .
you are becoming so hard and bitter and it 's not really like you . â€™
mark sighed .
â€˜ i 'm sorry .
it 's just â€¦ . â€™
â€˜ it 's just that there really is trouble at t'mill , â€™ she said quietly .
â€˜ that 's it , is n't it ?
you were n't going to tell me .
you were just going to worry about it alone .
you let me go rabitting on â€¦ .
he hugged her ; kissed her cheek .
â€˜ i 'm not sure yet that there really is something to worry about . â€™
â€˜ but you think there is . â€™
he nodded .
â€˜ i have a horrible feeling that um is about to reorganise world-wide planning operation and , if that happens , it 's curtain for the european organisation and for me . â€™
â€˜ curtain ? â€™ she said .
â€˜ what exactly would that mean ? â€™
â€˜ early retirement . â€™
â€˜ mark , you 're not serious ! ,
â€˜ i think it could be on the card .
they could transfer me to detroit , or somewhere .
i do n't know , but i do n't like the sign . â€™
â€˜ oh , mark , â€™ she said .
â€˜ they would n't do that to you .
they just could n't .
not after all you 've done for the corporation .
they could n't be that unfair and ruthless . â€™
his expression wa wry .
â€˜ my dear , they 'll do whatever they feel is necessary to do .
sentiment , loyalty , service and track record , none of these thing will come into it . â€™
georgina took him in her arm and kissed him on the lip .
â€˜ it 's all so ridiculous that we 're not going to even think about it any more , â€™ she said firmly , hiding her fear .
â€˜ now come into the garden , â€™ she added , smiling .
â€˜ i want to show you the clematis .
it 's a mass of colour . â€™
lying in bed that evening , they talked a lot about their life together .
they recalled their first day .
the county ball .
the paul jones and the emotional somersault when the music stopped and they came face to face for the very first time .
the wedding .
the birth of their first son , adam , and then christopher and andrew .
the child growing up with all the laughter and tear .
schooldays and the void they both felt when the boy went off to boarding school , followed by the joy unconfined when they came home at the end of term .
mark 's promotion and progress up the company ladder .
new and changing home .
friend lost and friend gained .
family achievement and disappointment .
notwithstanding current problem which they discussed lightly , it had all been wonderful .
they fell asleep in the early hour of the morning , holding hand .
the next day mark arrived back at um 's european headquarters in london and received an early call from muldoon .
he went down the airless corridor to his bos 's office , said hello to the secretary , and walked into the large oak-panelled room which wa a big a the lobby of many a sizeable hotel .
muldoon rose immediately from his enormous black leather chair to greet him , coming from behind the vast desk with hand outstretched .
â€˜ hello mark .
have a good trip ? â€™
he took the englishman by the arm and ushered him toward the easy chair arranged around a long rectangular coffee table .
instinctively , mark felt uneasy .
why the hand on the arm and the over-friendly approach ?
muldoon never emerged from behind his desk to greet colleague .
only visitor and vip got that special reception .
muldoon poured the coffee .
â€˜ how did the planning meeting go ? â€™
mark asked him .
â€˜ what wa nate 's reaction ?
did he and the committee go along with my proposal ? â€™ he added .
â€˜ it went fine , â€™ muldoon said .
he seemed somewhat uneasy .
â€˜ klepner did a good job . â€™
â€˜ how did he handle the question ? â€™
mark asked .
â€˜ he doe n't have the inside knowledge to deal with question . â€™
â€˜ oh , ok really .
i handled some and so did mueller .
but klepner did ok .
he did n't let the side down . â€™
mark nodded .
â€˜ what wa mueller doing answering question .
he wa there to ask them .
he doe n't know the inside track any more than klepner . â€™
â€˜ maybe not , but he soon will , â€™ muldoon replied quietly .
â€˜ and what doe that mean ? â€™
muldoon seemed to be taking a long time over his coffee .
he evaded mark 's eye .
â€˜ he 's goin' to head-up world planning operation from detroit . â€™
â€˜ he 's already co-ordinating the regional plan to provide a world picture .
so what 's changed ? â€™
deep down he knew .
â€˜ he 's not going to just co-ordinate and consolidate any longer , â€™ muldoon said , with increasing nervousness .
â€˜ he 's gon na plan , direct and control worldwide planning operation from detroit , including the regional planning function . â€™
mark 's expression wa one of faked incredulity .
his gut feeling had been right .
â€˜ you 've got to be joking ! â€™ he scoffed .
â€˜ i know that 's what mueller 's always wanted , but nate and the executive committee would never fall for that bloody empire-building game !
the region are far too big and complex to be handled from detroit and even if they were foolish enough to believe that they could do it more effectively â€” which they ca n't â€” they would be crazy to try . â€™
â€˜ i know , mark , i know , â€™ muldoon said .
â€˜ but that 's what they 're gon na do . â€™
â€˜ it will boomerang , â€™ the englishman said heatedly .
â€˜ overseas government and local national just wo n't stand for it , particularly when they get to know what 's going on .
that 's one corporate plan that ca n't win , not in the long term .
â€˜ i know , mark .
but they think they can run everything from detroit and that 's the way the organisation is going to be restructured .
they are working on it right now .
we will know the detail in a few week â€™ time .
couple of month at the latest . â€™
mark said quietly :
â€˜ and how doe that affect the european organisation ?
â€˜ the organisation will be wound up .
i 'm taking early retirement . â€™
â€˜ and me ? â€™
muldoon shrugged .
â€˜ not certain yet .
but my guess is early retirement too , unless you 're prepared to go back to divisional work .
local md perhaps ? â€™
the englishman snorted .
â€˜ you know i ca n't go back .
who the hell can ?
in any case , you know a well a i do that the md are always american . â€™
â€˜ well , there wo n't be any european job function , that 's for sure , â€™ muldoon said .
â€˜ there 'll be a direct link between detroit and the line manager in each country , with detroit calling the shot . â€™
â€˜ do n't they realise they 're playing with political dynamite ?
mark demanded .
â€˜ mueller wo n't give a damn about the effect of a corporate plan on europe and on individual country .
if he want to import vehicle or component from taiwan or singapore or hong kong into europe , he 'll go ahead and do it , regardless of the economic consequence for the european country concerned .
the only thing you can be sure of is that u interest will always come first .
oh , and there 's one more thing you can be sure of , â€™ he added sourly .
â€˜ they wo n't plan to supply the u market from import .
you can bet your bottom dollar on that !
jesus wept ! â€™ he continued , hackle rising .
â€˜ mueller will have the power to make or break whole area of europe .
he 's the last guy in the world who should be given such power .
the bloody man 's power drunk already . â€™
he wa angry and bitter .
â€˜ i know , â€™ muldoon agreed sadly .
â€˜ then what are you and clancy doing about it ? â€™
â€˜ look , mark , â€™ muldoon said forlornly â€˜ what 's the point ?
the wheel have already been set in motion .
we 're not gon na change anyone 's mind .
you know that . â€™
his tone wa abject .
â€˜ sorry you 're takin' it so bad , â€™ he added miserably .
â€˜ how else should i take it ? â€™
mark demanded .
â€˜ it 's my life which is about to go down the plughole .
i 'm not an american on a brief overseas assignment .
i 've spent my entire working life in the european component â€™ business .
i 've grown up in it .
it 's in my blood .
i 've built plant and managed them .
designed product and marketed and sold them .
when i wa an apprentice there were two component plant in europe , and now there are seventeen , and i 've had a hand in establishing the last twelve .
what the hell do you expect me to say ?
oh , is that what they are proposing to do ?
well bully for mueller and the corporation ?
i 'll go and collect my hat and coat ! â€™
â€˜ i know how you feel , mark , â€™ muldoon said sadly .
â€˜ do you , pat ?
do you ?
you 're sixty-one and have been looking forward to retirement .
i 'm fifty and have a long way to go .
i do n't think you can see thing the way i see them .
â€˜ well , perhaps not , â€™ muldoon agreed .
â€˜ but i can understand how you feel . â€™
the englishman nodded and poured himself more coffee .
â€˜ so what 's going to happen to the european plan ? â€™ he asked .
â€˜ mueller will drive it from detroit , with one or two amendment agreed at the epc meeting , â€™ muldoon told him .
â€˜ what amendment ? â€™
â€˜ no further plant investment in the uk . â€™
â€˜ i suppose mueller saw to that , â€™ mark said sarcastically .
â€˜ he really hate our gut !
god help the british plant under the new regime ! â€™
muldoon shook his head .
â€˜ no , it wa n't that .
it wa the strike at merseyside .
that wa the last straw a far a nate wa concerned .
up until that news hit the committee , don had won the day with his uk vehicle division proposal .
but a soon a nate heard about the latest strike , that wa it .
end of story .
he instructed mueller to phase-out vehicle manufacture in the uk . â€™
mark nodded .
â€˜ how did don take it ?
he wa beginning to win through . â€™
â€˜ he 's very upset .
naturally .
it 's the first time in his career he ha n't come out on top .
mueller is taking over the plan , and don is being transferred back to the state .
public relation job or something similar .
just think of it , a man of his talent and ability stooging around the medium . â€™
â€˜ so when 's he going back to the state ? â€™
mark said .
â€˜ it wo n't be announced for a week or so , but he 's already been told .
he 'll fly out inside the month . â€™
â€˜ and what do you and i do now ?
mark enquired .
â€˜ start emptying the file ? â€™
muldoon made a face .
â€˜ afraid so .
klepner will take over the file and ship them back to the state .
he 'll be mueller 's european component â€™ planning manager in detroit . â€™
â€˜ klepner ? â€™
mark uttered in mock astonishment .
â€˜ the man know nothing about europe .
he 's a novice .
a bloody charlatan ! â€™
â€˜ i know it sound crazy , mark , â€™ muldoon said .
â€˜ but there it is .
we have no choice in the matter .
i wa instructed to tell you , and i have .
new york and detroit will come up with an attractive separation package , you can be sure of that .
they 've already told me you 'll get the maximum term permitted under british law .
the corporation want to do the right thing by you . â€™
the two men rose from the table together .
â€˜ sure .
we have no choice in the matter , â€™ said the englishman .
â€˜ there ha to be loser a well a winner , , said the american .
â€˜ i guess we 're both loser , mark . â€™
the englishman returned to his own palatial office and sat with his head in hand .
another of his blinding headache had developed and he felt a tight sensation in his chest , which made breathing very painful and difficult .
his secretary entered the room .
can i get you a coffee , mr sander ?
you do n't look at all well .
shall i get the doctor ? â€™
he looked up and smiled .
â€˜ no thank you millie .
i 'm all right .
just a headache .
be ok in a minute .
would love a cup of coffee though .
â€˜ are you sure i should n't get a doctor ? â€™ she asked .
â€˜ no thank you .
i 'll be ok .
it 's only a headache . â€™
millie had her reason for being concerned .
the petticoat mafia at the top of the organisation always knew what wa going on , often before the top executive themselves .
millie and the secretary of pat muldoon and clancy mcgillicuddy were all close friend .
they had got together over the weekend to discus the implication of the confidential letter the two american had received from randy mueller on behalf of nate cocello .
major change were afoot which affected their respective boss .
by the time mark reached home that evening , the pain in his head were excruciating .
he decided against telling georgina about his meeting with muldoon .
he would wait for the right moment .
this wa n't it .
homicide
this chapter deal with the approach of the criminal law to behaviour which cause or risk causing death .
murder , manslaughter , and several other offence are discussed , and one recurrent issue here is whether english law responds proportionately to the different degree of culpability manifested in case where death is caused .
7.1 death and finality
for practical purpose , the culpable causing of another person 's death may fairly be regarded a the most serious offence in the criminal calendar .
there is an argument that treason is a more serious offence , since it strike at the very foundation of the state and it social organization , but treason is so rare that it is surely permissible to treat homicide a the most serious form of crime .
the reason for this is not difficult to find : the harm caused by many other crime is remediable to a degree , whereas the harm caused by homicide is absolutely irremediable .
even in crime of violence which leave some permanent physical disfigurement or psychological effect , the victim retains his or her life and , therefore , the possibility of further pleasure and achievement , whereas death is final .
this finality make it proper to regard death a the most serious harm that may be inflicted on another , and to regard a person who chooses to inflict that harm a the most culpable of offender , in the absence of some excuse or justification .
although many death arise from natural cause , and many others from illness and disease , each year see a large number of death caused by â€˜ accident â€™ , and also a number caused by act or omission which amount to some form of homicide in english law .
for 1987 the statistic show that there were some 20,000 accidental death , of which some 7,000 occurred in the home , 6,000 at work , and 5,000 on the road .
by comparison , the number of death recorded a criminal homicide wa 600 , which includes all the murder and manslaughter .
this figure is relatively small when compared with many american city , but that is no cause for satisfaction .
there are still awkward question to be confronted .
for example , are we satisfied that the 600 death recorded a homicide are in fact more culpable than all , or even most , of the death recorded a accident ?
in other word , doe english criminal law pick out the most heinous form of killing a murder and manslaughter , or are the boundary frozen by tradition ?
another question is whether the criminal law ought not to be wider in it application to activity which carry some risk of causing death than in other sphere .
thus , even if it would be excessive to sweep large number of the death now recorded a â€˜ accident â€™ into the law of homicide , there may be sufficient justification for creating or enforcing offence designed to ensure safe condition of work , safe good , safe building , and so on .
it wa argued in chapter 2 that the criminal law ought to spread it net wider where the potential harm is greater .
it will be seen that english law doe this up to a point , and in the process seems to accept social-defence argument a reason for departing from several of the principle set out in chapter 3 .
7.2 requirement of criminal homicide
english law distinguishes between the offence of murder and manslaughter , a we shall see , but the two crime do have certain common element .
it must be proved that the defendant 's act or omission caused the death of the victim within a year and a day .
( the requirement of causation in the criminal law are discussed elsewhere . )
the â€˜ year and a day â€™ rule is a legacy of time when medical science wa so rudimentary that , if there wa a substantial lapse of time between injury and death , it wa unsafe to pronounce on whether the defendant 's conduct or some other event caused the death .
nowadays the problem is quite the reverse : medical science is generally able to determine whether d's conduct caused the death , and innovation such a life-support machine mean that life can be prolonged for month and year in some instance .
in one recent case the victim of a stabbing died two and a half year after the incident , having been kept on a life-support machine for almost the entire time .
in principle , it seems unjust that a homicide conviction should not be possible in such a case , if all the other element can be established and only the â€˜ year and a day â€™ rule stand in the way .
but the rule wa confirmed by the criminal law revision committee in 1980 , on the ground that a defendant should not be left in peril of a homicide conviction indefinitely .
surely prosecutorial discretion should be enough to prevent unfair conviction year after the event .
the rule itself is out of accord with modern medical condition and should be abolished .
defining murder : the inclusionary question
( a ) the procedural context
if causing death is to be regarded a the most serious harm that can be inflicted , it would seem to follow that the most blameworthy form of homicide should result in the highest sentence imposed by the court .
indeed , many system of criminal law impose a mandatory sentence for murder ( or whatever the highest form of homicide is called in that system ) .
in some jurisdiction this is a mandatory sentence of death .
in others , such a those in the united kingdom , it is the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment .
why should this penalty be mandatory , and not at the discretion of the court a in other offence ?
one argument in favour of the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment is that it amount to a symbolic indication of the unique heinousness of murder .
it place the offender under the state 's control , a it were , for the remainder of his or her life .
this is often linked with a supposed denunciatory effect â€” the idea that the mandatory life sentence denounces murder a emphatically a possible â€” and with a supposed general deterrent effect , in declaring that there is no mitigation of sentence available for this crime .
it might also be argued that the mandatory life sentence make a substantial contribution to public safety .
none of these argument is notably strong , let alone conclusive .
the mandatory penalty doe indeed serve to mark out murder from other crime , but whether the definition of murder is sufficiently refined to capture the worst killing , and only the worst killing , remains to be discussed below .
whether the life sentence is regarded a a sufficient denunciation in society depends on the public 's perception of what life imprisonment mean : if it is widely believed that it result in an average of nine year ' imprisonment , the effect will be somewhat blunted .
the same applies to the general deterrent argument : it effectiveness depends on whether the penalty for murder affect the calculation of potential killer at all , and , if it doe , whether life imprisonment is seen a significantly more or le severe than the alternative of a long , fixed-term sentence .
a for public protection , this depends on executive decision with regard to release ; it fails to take into account whether it is necessary for public protection to keep â€˜ lifer â€™ in for so long .
this brings the discussion to a crucial point : what doe the sentence of life imprisonment mean in practice , and what would be the alternative ?
what it mean is that the time of release from prison is determined by the home secretary , on the advice of the parole board and the lord chief justice , rather than by the judge at the trial .
in procedural term , therefore , the life sentence involves a transfer of function : normally it is the judge who determines the sentence ( or at least it upper limit , since earlier release on parole may be possible ) , whereas a life sentence entrusts that function to the executive , who must first ascertain the opinion of the lord chief justice and the trial judge .
the home office is not bound by those opinion , and appears to depart from them frequently .
in 1983 the home secretary imposed restriction on the release of person serving life for murder of police- and prison-officers , terrorist killing , murder during robbery , and the sadistic or sexual murder of young child , fixing a minimum of twenty year ' imprisonment for these offender .
whatever the justification for introducing this policy , it serf to underline the fact that sentencing in murder case is enacted without each case being considered individually , after hearing representation from the offender 's counsel , and without a sentence announced in court and subject to appeal .
at present , the executive take decision to release some murderer after only a few year and to keep others in prison for extremely long period .
should those decision not be taken by the court , in the same way a other sentencing decision ?
the answer sometimes given is that murderer should be treated differently because they are particularly dangerous : anyone who chooses to kill once can choose to kill again .
but this argument will seem le persuasive when we have discussed case of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility : where a murder is reduced to manslaughter , the judge ha a wide sentencing discretion and may , according to the fact of the case , select a determinate prison sentence , a hospital order , or life imprisonment .
those who kill and are convicted of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility are no le dangerous than those convicted of murder , and yet the judge ha sentencing discretion in one case and not in the other .
consideration of this kind have led the house of lord select committee on murder and life imprisonment to recommend the abolition of the mandatory sentence for murder .
in it place would be a sentencing discretion , which judge would use , in many case , to mark the relative heinousness of the murder by a determinate prison sentence .
in case where life imprisonment wa thought to be the appropriate sentence , the trial judge would still specify â€” in open court â€” the number of year to be spent in prison , taking the gravity of the offence into account , and release would be determined by a judicial tribunal .
such a reform would bring improvement in natural justice without loss of public protection .
( b ) degree of homicide
english criminal law ha two degree of homicide , murder and manslaughter .
many american jurisdiction have three degree of murder â€” first-degree murder , requiring premeditation , and second- and third-degree murder , covering lesser shade of culpability .
in england there ha been a proposal that we should do away with all these distinction , leaving a single offence of criminal homicide .
that proposal , if implemented , would shift almost all the decision-making in homicide case from the trial to the sentencing stage : the only issue of any consequence in most case would be the sentence to be imposed , and all the distinction now drawn at the stage of criminal liability would be reflected in the sentence alone .
the jury would have no role in most homicide case , since a plea of guilty would be the norm .
contrast this with the position in jurisdiction where there are three or more degree of homicide : plea of guilty to first- and second-degree murder would be le frequent , since there would be the possibility of argument in court ( if no bargain wa struck beforehand between prosecution and defence ) , and the defence might succeed in persuading the jury to reduce the degree of the killing .
moreover , the borderline between the various degree would raise question of law , which would provide much opportunity for legal argument and for appeal .
the result would be that killing were classified and labelled in a more refined way , but at the cost of lengthy trial and mounting legal-aid bill .
that cost is not difficult to justify where capital punishment is the penalty for first-degree murder .
where there is no capital punishment , however , the question of how many degree of homicide it is desirable to have call for careful weighing of the principle of fair labelling ( see chapter 3.3 ( l ) ) against the cost and time argument mobilised by the policy of efficient administration ( see chapter 3.3 ( m ) ) .
the structure of the english law of homicide is rather strange .
although there are two offence , murder and manslaughter , the latter includes two distinct variety : â€˜ voluntary â€™ manslaughter ( killing which would be murder but for the existence of defined extenuating circumstance ) ; and â€˜ involuntary â€™ manslaughter ( killing for which there is no need to prove any awareness of the risk of death being caused , but for which there is thought to be sufficient fault to justify criminal liability ) .
the argument therefore tend to focus on three borderline question : what is the minimum fault required for conviction of murder ?
what condition are needed to reduce murder to manslaughter ?
and what is the minimum fault required for a conviction of manslaughter .
( c ) requirement for murder
in english criminal law there are now two alternative fault requirement for murder : an intent to kill , or an intent to cause grievous bodily harm .
what do these requirement mean ?
do they extend the definition of murder too far , or are they too narrow .
intent to kill may be regarded a the most obvious and indisputable form of fault element for murder , but to some extent that depends on the meaning of â€˜ intent â€™ .
this ha been the subject of a number of house of lord decision , and yet the definition is still not clear and settled .
probably the most accurate statement would be that a person intends to kill if it is his or her purpose to kill by the act or omission charged , or if he or she foresees that death is practically certain to follow from that act or omission .
in this way , both purpose and foresight of practical certainty are regarded a part of the definition of intent , although there are other statement suggesting that foresight of practical or â€˜ virtual â€™ certainty is merely evidence from which intent may be inferred .
how would this test be applied ?
in many case the word â€˜ intent â€™ is used without elaboration , but there are some for which a full explanation of the meaning of intention is necessary .
a fairly typical set of fact is provided by nedrick ( 1986 ) , where d had a grudge against a woman and had threatened to â€˜ burn her out â€™ .
one night he went to her house , poured paraffin through the letter-box and on to the front door , and set it alight .
one of the woman 's child died in the ensuing fire .
when asked why he did it , d replied : â€˜ just to wake her up and frighten her . â€™
a defence of this kind , a claim that the purpose wa only to frighten and not to cause harm , requires the full definition to be put to the jury .
the question is : granted that d's purpose wa to frighten , did he nonetheless realize that it wa practically certain that his act would cause death or grievous bodily harm to someone ?
the jury should answer this by drawing inference from the evidence in the case and from the surrounding circumstance .
what about the alternative element in the definition , an intent to cause grievous bodily harm ?
this ha considerable practical importance , since this is all that the prosecution ha to prove in order to obtain a verdict of guilty of murder .
it must be shown that the defendant intended ( which , again , includes both purpose and awareness of practical certainty ) to cause really serious injury to someone .
the house of lord confirmed this rule in cunningham ( 1981 ) : d struck his victim on the head a number of time with a chair , causing injury from which the victim died a week later .
d maintained throughout that he had not intended to kill , but there wa evidence from which the jury could infer â€” and did infer â€” that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm .
the house of lord upheld d 's conviction for murder : an intent to cause really serious injury is sufficient for murder , without any proof that the defendant intended , or even contemplated , the possibility that death would result .
doe the â€˜ grievous bodily harm â€™ rule extend the definition of murder too far ?
if the point of distinguishing murder from manslaughter is to mark out the most heinous group of killing for the extra stigma of a murder conviction , it can be argued that the â€˜ grievous bodily harm â€™ rule draw the line too low .
in term of principle , the rule requires justification because it departs from the principle of correspondence ( see chapter 5.2(a) ) , namely that the fault element in a crime should relate to the consequence prohibited by that crime .
by allowing an intent to cause grievous bodily harm to suffice for a murder conviction , the law is violating a general principle , turning the most serious of it offence into a constructive crime .
why should it be necessary to â€˜ construct â€™ a murder conviction out of this lesser intent ?
there are argument in favour of this : death is final , murder is the gravest crime , and there is no significant moral difference between someone who chooses to cause really serious injury and someone who set out to kill .
no one can predict whether a serious injury will result in death â€” that may depend on the victim 's physique , on the speed of an ambulance , on the distance from the hospital , and on a range of other medical and individual matter .
if one person chooses to cause serious injury to another , it should be presumed that he or she realizes that there is always a risk of death , and such case show a sufficiently wanton disregard for life a to warrant the label â€˜ murder â€™ if death result .
the counter-arguments , which would uphold the principle of correspondence , are that breach of that principle is unnecessary when the amplitude of the crime of manslaughter lie beneath murder , and also that the definition of grievous bodily harm includes a number of injury which are most unlikely to put the victim 's life at risk .
in the leading case of cunningham lord edmund-davies ( dissenting ) gave the example of breaking someone 's arm : that is a really serious injury , but one which is unlikely to endanger the victim 's life .
so in practice the â€˜ grievous bodily harm â€™ rule go further than the argument of it protagonist would support .
would it be right , then , to confine the fault element in murder to an intent to kill ?
that would have the merit of simplicity , but would it strike the right note socially ?
there are powerful argument in favour of saying that there are other killing where an intent to kill can not be established , and yet where the moral or social culpability is equal to that in most intentional killing .
of course , one can not be adamant about whether they merit the label â€˜ murder â€™ , because that is a question of drawing the line between murder and manslaughter , which is not susceptible of any precise resolution .
it is hard to argue conclusively that the category of murder should be smaller or larger ( unless the death penalty or a mandatory life sentence follows ) ; it is a question of social judgment .
let u briefly consider some of the possibility .
the fault element for many serious offence is intent or recklessness : why should this not suffice for murder ?
the question is whether all killing in which the defendant is aware of the risk of death are sufficiently serious to warrant the term â€˜ murder â€™ .
one answer sometimes given is that they are not , because a driver who overtakes on a bend , knowingly taking the risk that there is a car travelling in the opposite direction , should not be labelled a murderer if a collision and death happen to ensue .
this example assumes that a sympathy for motorist with overwhelm any tendency to logical analysis .
one might ask whether motorist are ever justified in knowingly taking risk with other people 's life .
yet if the example is modified a little , so that the overtaking is on a country road at night and the risk is known to be slight , it becomes questionable whether the causing of death in these circumstance should be labelled in the same way a intentional killing .
this is not to suggest that motorist should be treated differently .
the point is rather that , even though knowingly taking risk with other people 's life is usually unjustifiable , taking a slight risk is le serious than intentionally causing death .
in discussing the boundary of murder , we are concerned with classification , not exculpation .
to classify all reckless killing a murder might be too broad , but the point remains that some reckless killing may be thought no le heinous than intentional killing .
can a satisfactory line be drawn here ?
one approach would be to draw the line by reference to the degree of probability .
murder is committed in those situation where d caused death by an act or omission which he knew had death a the probable or highly probable result .
a version of this test of foresight of high probability is used in several other european country ; it wa introduced into english law by the decision in hyam v.
dpp ( 1975 ) , but abandoned in moloney ( 1985 ) on ground of uncertainty .
a second approach is to frame the law in such a way a to make it clear that the court should make a moral judgment on the gravity of the defendant 's conduct .
section 210.2 of the model penal code includes within murder those reckless killing which manifest â€˜ extreme indifference to the value of human life â€™ .
scot law treat a murder killing with â€˜ wicked recklessness â€™ , a phrase which directs the court 's attention to the circumstance of the killing .
both the model penal code test and the scot test may be reduced to circularity , however , for when one asks how extreme or how wicked the recklessness should be , the only possible answer is : â€˜ wicked or extreme enough to justify the stigma of a murder conviction â€™ .
admittedly , the model penal code doe contain a list of circumstance which may amount to extreme indifference , which assist the court and increase the predictability of verdict in a way that scot law doe not , but the essence of both approach is that there is no precise way of describing those non-intentional killing which are a heinous a intentional killing .
their protagonist argue that the law of murder is so important socially that derogation from the principle of maximum certainty should be allowed in favour of more accurate labelling by the court ; opponent argue that the principle of maximum certainty is needed here specifically to reduce the risk of verdict based on discriminatory or irrelevant factor , such a distaste for the defendant 's background , allegiance , or other activity .
a third , more precise formulation derives from the recommendation of the criminal law revision committee in 1980 , namely , that a killing should be classified a murder in those situation where there is an intention to cause serious injury coupled with awareness of the risk of death .
neither an intention to cause serious injury nor recklessness a to death should be sufficient on it own , but together they restrict one another , producing a test which both satisfies the criterion of certainty and mark out some heinous but non-intended killing .
a fourth approach , adopted by english law until 1957 and still in force in many american jurisdiction , is some form of felony-murder rule : anyone who kill during the course of a felony ( or , more restrictively , a serious crime of violence ) or whilst resisting arrest should be convicted of murder .
thus stated , there is no reference to the defendant 's intention or awareness of the risk : the fact that d ha chosen to commit rape , robbery , or another serious offence , and ha caused death thereby , is held to constitute sufficient moral ground for placing the killing in the highest category .
plainly , this is a form of constructive criminal liability : the murder conviction is constructed out of the ingredient of a lesser offence .
presumably the justification is that d ha already crossed a high moral/social threshold in choosing to commit such a serious offence , and should therefore be held liable for whatever consequence ensue , however unforeseeable they may be .
the objection would be reduced if awareness of the risk of death wa also required : in other word , if the test were the commission of a serious offence of violence plus recklessness a to death .
the effect of that test would be to pick out those reckless killing which occurred when d had already manifested substantial moral and legal culpability , and to classify them a murder .
four alternative approach have been described , and many others could be listed .
the point is that the traditional concept of intention and recklessness do not , of themselves , appear to be sufficiently well focused to mark out those killing which are the most heinous .
the law must resort to some kind of moral and social evaluation of conduct if it is to identify and separate out the most heinous killing .
many people might think that a person who cause death whilst using an unlawfully held firearm or explosive ought to be convicted of murder because there is , generally speaking , no excuse for using such dangerous equipment .
some of the people thus covered would be armed robber , others would be terrorist .
the armed robber might say that he had no intention of using the firearm , that he carried it with him simply to frighten the victim , and that it went off accidentally : if the jury belief that , should he be convicted of murder ?

francesca simon describes some of the pitfall â€” and how to avoid them
by francesca simon
debbie adam had to let her east end terrace house in london in a hurry when her husband wa re-located to ireland with two month ' notice .
she went to a local letting agency , landlord of 41 roman road , bethnal green , london e2 , who found a tenant that day .
she also employed landlord to manage the let .
a is common practice , landlord kept the tenant 's deposit of â£650 and told debbie they would take their entire fee of â£881 up front , so she expected no rent for the first month .
but july also passed without debbie receiving any money .
â€˜ i phoned and said , â€˜ where 's the money ? â€™ and wa told there were problem with the book-keeper , who would be coming in to sort it out , â€™ say debbie .
â€˜ but nothing happened and i never heard from them . â€™
she repeatedly phoned landlord , but wa either unable to get an answer or told that manager howard keizner wa unavailable .
finally , after the third month passed with no rent received , debbie phoned the tenant , asked them to pay her directly , and sent landlord a recorded-delivery letter , which wa returned , and finally one by ordinary post stating that landlord were no longer employed a the managing agent .
because they had n't done any management , debbie felt landlord were entitled only to the 10 per cent tenant-finding fee and therefore owed her â£2,400 ( 3 month ' rent plus the deposit ) .
in december 1991 she sued .
landlord did n't acknowledge the writ , so in january debbie 's solicitor requested a judgment in default for the full amount plus interest and court fee , a total of â£2,453.24 .
just before the court wa due to hear the request her solicitor received a cheque for â£2,400 .
â€˜ they had n't paid the interest and court fee , but we got back every single penny they owed .
we were lucky , â€™ say debbie adam .
howard keizner , of landlord , said : â€˜ there were a lot of complication with this particular letting and management . â€™
but he declined further comment .
last week he promised to supply u with a written explanation of the way his company had treated debbie , but it never arrived .
yusuf and shabira gulamali were le fortunate .
they lost over â£4,000 dealing with two letting agency which closed down without paying them the rent and tenant ' deposit owed on their wembley flat .
they hired the first agent , â€˜ dig â€™ , of oxford street , to manage a well a to let their flat .
the gulamalis received their rent for the first three month , then nothing for four month , and were told the computer wa broken , the account were being moved , the cheque wa in the post , and so on .
â€˜ after four month they closed down owing u â£3,500 , â€™ say shabira .
â€˜ together with some other client we took the owner to court but he escaped to spain . â€™
the second time round they dealt with r. and b. letting in london nw10 , who they instructed just to find a tenant .
the gulamalis never received the agreement form , the tenant ' deposit or the first month 's rent .
â€˜ finally , we went to the office and they gave u a cheque , which bounced . â€™
the office of r and b. letting are now up for sale .
â€˜ anyone can set up a letting agency , â€™ say david galsworthy , vice president of the national association of estate agent .
â€˜ they come and go , so it pay to deal with a member of a professional body , such a the naea , the royal institute of chartered surveyor or the incorporated society of valuer and auctioneer .
in case of a dispute you can complain to the professional body , and member are bonded , which mean that deposit and rent are covered in case of fraud or dishonesty . â€™
if you are thinking of letting your property , the following point will help to safeguard your interest :
ask any agency you are considering using if they are a member of one of the above professional association .
if in doubt , ask to see proof of their membership .
if , in addition to finding a tenant , the agency is managing the let , you should be paid every month , le a tenant-finding fee of between two and four week ' rent .
the agency will keep the tenant 's deposit until the tenant leaf .
if the letting agent is not managing the flat , the tenant 's deposit should be given to the owner immediately .
expect to pay a management fee of up to 15 per cent .
some agency deduct it every month , others want it all up front , so shop around .
if the owner is abroad , the agent will also collect tax at the standard rate of 25 per cent , which will be deducted from your monthly rent cheque .
letting agency should never charge tenant a finder 's fee , although according to galsworthy , many agency do .
â€˜ it 's not ethical a they are acting for the landlord , â€™ he say .
the self-regulating naea ha 10,000 member , of which 2,000 also do letting and management .
but galsworthy belief there is a clear need for the licensing of all letting agent .
â€˜ we want everyone to be licensed , but the government did n't think it necessary .
section 22 of the 1979 estate agent act dealing with bonding , licensing and standard of competency ha not been brought in .
but we must have a common code and we must have licensing , â€™ he said .
until then , owner and tenant beware .
travel : copse and robber christopher somerville see how woodland ha usurped the ancient cattle thief of the cheviot hill
by christopher somerville
when a charlton chief sat down to dinner in time gone by and found a spur on the table where his meal should have been , he knew the cupboard wa bare once more .
his wife wa telling him to saddle up and steal a fresh batch of cattle from his neighbour 's herd .
the family of north tynedale in westernmost northumberland â€” charltons and robsons , milburns and dodds â€” were never slow to lay hand on each other 's property in the lawless old day .
here , where the scottish border ran across the cheviot hill , far from civilisation , â€˜ reiving â€™ , or cattle-thieving , wa a way of life .
remoteness is still the keynote of this region , but a charlton reiving party would be hard put to it these day to work up a good gallop along the upper reach of the north tyne river .
since 1926 the western fringe of the cheviot have been planted with 250 square mile of close-packed conifer , while in their depth sprawl the seven mile of the kielder water reservoir , europe 's largest man-made lake .
i found it hard to picture what kind of landscape those statistic might have shaped , until i opened the ordnance survey map to find half of it coloured green with a great blue stain in the centre .
kielder water is beautiful , and the kielder tree formidably impressive in their domination of the hill .
but by the time i had turned off the road from bellingham at kielder village and driven up the bumpy forest drive to east kielder farm , i wa longing for the sight of something other than water and tree .
relief wa at hand .
the farm stand on a spur of moorland on the northern edge of the forest , and within 10 minute i had turned my back on the corduroy battalion of tree and wa striding under a still , cloudy sky over tussock of rush and coarse grass , with my face to the long , bare shoulder of open hillside that flank the winding shallow of the east kielder burn .
the footpath that run with the burn is not one of those carefully waymarked and leafleted by the forestry commission .
there are few attraction for the kielder tourist here .
the burn thread a wild and inhospitable crevice of the hill , where the wind blow cold and the sense of isolation grows with each lonely mile .
walking here , you leave the 20th century behind on the outskirt of the forest and enter the reconstructed emptiness in which the reivers and cross-border raider of the past could operate unhindered .
i squelched across tiny burn running in black channel of peat , and stood looking down from the hillside on to the grey roof of scaup farm .
the hollow barking of a dog came from one of the stone shed , but there wa no sign of life around the building .
scaup must be just about the loneliest farm in england , tucked down in the shelter of the hill with kielder forest 's dark mass blocking it southward view and the narrowing valley of the burn filling half the sky to the north .
the east kielder burn divide here into scaup burn and white kielder burn .
i dropped down the hill to ford white kielder upstream of the ruined farmstead of kielder head , where a line of stunted alder , shaggy with lichen , leaned over their leafless reflection in the peat-brown water .
spring come late to this windm_bitten and rain-soaked valley .
but there were new-born lamb in the sheep pen of scaup , and a cheery â€˜ hello now â€™ from the farmer and his wife tending them .
those were the last human voice i heard all day .
no-one life up here in the cleft of the white kielder burn .
the rough land is altogether too harsh and unyielding , giving sustenance only to sheep , and to the conifer high on the flank of east kielder moor and grey mare knowe , immense sweep of hillside to right and left of the valley .
the footpath on the left bank of the burn wa little better than a sheep track , but there were clue to it former importance a a droving road over the hill to byrness in redesdale .
large boulder stood out beside the path a grey blob in the featureless sheet of pale grass , and flat stone had been placed a bridge across the burn , their back hollowed by the tread of foot through the century .
following these now disregarded sign of past activity along the old path , i traversed the hillside and came down to a crumbling stone sheepfold with the roofless remains of a shepherd 's hut built into one wall .
the tiny single room wa jammed with the mossy timber of disused sheep pen , but the little iron fire grate that once warmed the hardy men who worked here wa still set in the foot of the hut 's tottering gable end , and the massive stone lintel had not yet fallen from it place above the doorway .
a dipper flew up from the burn a i emerged from the hut , his white breast flashing a he darted downstream .
somewhere ahead in the crag of kielderhead moor a hawk wa whistling , a piercing sound in the lonely valley , overlain for a few heart-stopping moment by the snarl of a jet .
that jarring manifestation of furious technology seemed a remote and ridiculous a a dream , a silence settled down on kielderhead and the hawk 's whistle came down from the moor .
the valley of the white kielder burn steepened again a i trudged north , it curve tightening .
now the path ran through heather high above the burn , past circular sheepfold long disused and over the stony bed of side stream where the grass hung smooth and inviting , concealing ankle-breaking drop .
a mile above the shepherd 's hut the hillside ceased their upward rolling and curved together to form a dead-end valley of broad-breasted slope five mile from the nearest tarmac road , hidden deep in the fold of the moor .
the old drover 's road turned aside here and climbed under the rock face of white crag to continue it lonely course over girdle fell and down into redesdale .
i could have gone with it , giving myself four blissful mile of upland walking followed by a many miserable hour of fruitless searching for return transport to east kielder farm .
instead i lay back in the heather and savoured the trickle of the burn and the crisp smell of peat-laden ground .
not a sign of spring had yet penetrated this secret valley , but another month would put that right .
there were five mile of return tramping to face , but they , too , could wait awhile .
election 1992 : and what can the politician do for meadowell ?
probably nothing at all
â€˜ joyriding â€™ riot propelled tyneside 's meadowell estate to national prominence last september .
ha the election campaign penetrated it grim street ?
by martyn harris
at the drop-in centre on south meadowell , labour candidate paddy cosgrove ha dropped in to meet the people â€” mostly fat lady in shellsuits with lap full of chip .
â€˜ you all know me , â€™ say paddy , and a fat lady with good timing say , â€˜ i do n't know you .
never seen you in me life . â€™
on the floor a toddler peel more chip from a congealed , bluish mass and feed them to a baby .
another dig the cream from the centre of a pink fancy and smear it in his hair .
paddy cosgrove , councillor and barrister , in candidate ' pinstripe , sits tensely on the edge of his plastic chair .
â€˜ i 'm a regular visitor to this estate â€¦ â€™
â€˜ who doe he say he is ? â€™ say a second fat lady .
â€˜ that liberal , paddy ashgrove â€¦ â€™
â€˜ he 's better looking on tv â€¦ â€™
â€˜ he 's only come because the press are here , â€™ say the first fat lady .
and paddy cosgrove blush .
political consciousness is low on the meadowell estate .
turnout at the last election wa around 50 per cent , and with the thinning of the electoral roll brought by the poll tax , will be even lower this time .
they are mostly labour voter but several confuse their labour candidate with the leader of the liberal democrat .
very few know their mp is a conservative , and hardly anyone that his name is neville trotter , defender of a slender 2,500 majority .
by most measure meadowell is the worst council estate in britain , and probably the most notorious since the riot last september , which followed the death of joyriders colin atkins and dale robson in a police chase .
in fact meadowell is an elastoplast name like sizewell , invented in the 1970s to disguise what wa already a running sore .
when built in 1938 it wa the ridge , which is still what they call it locally â€” a slum clearance project on the north bank of the tyne , 10 mile east of newcastle .
it first inhabitant were shipyard and fishquay worker from the riverside town of north shield and wallsend , who moved happily from their tumbledown terrace to these fine new house with inside toilet and garden .
many , like ronnie collyer , a retired shipyard worker , still live here and are still proud of the place .
all the trouble , say ronnie , is down to â€˜ a few family who doa n't keep their young â€™ un in order .
and then the medium coom down and blow everything up . â€™
he ha polished shoe , a close shave , and too much pride for a free drink .
â€˜ it 's a canny place the ridge , with plenty of good folk . â€™
but something wa wrong from the start .
some say it wa the importing of whole street of fighting family from the fishquays , with their dockland diversion of prostitution , drug-dealing and handling .
others say it wa the shortage of pub , shop , church , transport and police station .
by the 1950s , the ridge wa the criminal ghetto of newcastle , and by the 1970s a costly council manicure job had turned it into a free-fire zone .
path and boundary vanished , allowing the tide of street life to wash right up to the doorstep .
joyriders used front lawn to practise their handbrake turn .
car theft became so common that private car virtually disappeared from the area .
shop like greengrocer and chippies , with pitiful cash taking , were routinely subjected to armed robbery with shotgun , balaclava â€” the whole bit .
when i ask the fat lady at the drop-in centre what is the one thing that would do most to improve the estate they say â€˜ get rid of the kid â€™ and they are only half joking .
the age structure of meadowell mean it is awash with teenager , whose only pastime are having baby and body-building .
do your husband come here ?
i ask , and they all laugh .
â€˜ the men are all useless â€” sitting indoors if there 's trouble in the street .
it 's woman have to go out and deal with it . â€™
by the time of the riot a quarter of all house on the estate were boarded up and burned out by infant petrol bomber .
unemployment wa 80 per cent on some street .
in meadowell primary , which ha 232 child , every one wa receiving a clothing grant .
the area had effectively been abandoned by the authority , a fact which became clear during the riot itself , when police waited five hour to enter the estate and put down the disturbance .
â€˜ and there were never more than a few dozen ringleader , â€™ bob mather , a local butcher , tell me .
â€˜ i wa stood outside me shop all night , and most were no more than kid . â€™
eight month on and little ha changed â€” if anything it is rather worse .
unemployment is up another 17 per cent ; more house and shop are boarded up ; burglary and joyriding continue â€” and if there is le ram-raiding it is only because 50 or so of the hardest case are still behind bar .
a food co-op which tried to replace the burned-out shop ha been closed after several break-in , and even the drop-in centre is burgled weekly , according to project worker sheila auld .
there is a new phone box , ripped from the wall and lying on the floor of her office to prove it .
meadowell ha even discovered a new martyr in the shape of one willy hunter , a local hard nut awaiting trial for murder , and allegedly the victim of a police frame-up .
â€˜ free willy hunter â€™ say the graffiti , next to the old , fading graffiti for dale robson and colin atkins .
my friend kevin , muscleman and minicab driver , say the lad would be out rioting for willy now if it wa n't tipping down with rain the whole time .
a few thing have been achieved , i suppose .
there are some posh flat going up at neighbouring royal quay which will provide building job : â€˜ it 's sun city in the middle of bantustan , â€™ a labour councillor said to me .
the cheviot housing association is slowly taking over property in south meadowell .
a new police station is to be built .
the government sponsored meadowell initiative make noise in the north of the estate â€” but doe pitifully little , painfully slowly .
north tyneside council say it is too starved of fund by central government to do much .
tory minister , like michael heseltine who visited meadowell last november , say the cash shortage are due to council profligacy and bad management .
mp neville trotter is a pear-shaped tory with pear-shaped vowel who ha little appeal to the people of meadowell , and a dwindling appeal in the middle-class suburb where unemployment is also climbing .
paddy cosgrove , his likely replacement , is a council hack of 21 year standing and ideal backbench fodder , though it is hard to imagine him leading a crusade for meadowell .
when i ask the people of the estate what they want from this election some say they want cheviot to rebuild it and others that it would be better grassed over .
some say they should bring back hanging ; others say it is the politician they should hang ; but most say there is nothing anybody can do at all .
general election : n trotter ( c ) 25,113 , p cosgrove ( lab ) 22,530 , d mayhew ( l/all ) 10,446 .
con maj : 2,583 .
sit , they said , but he would n't this week john major began to appear on a different kind of box .
in the last of his series on the leader , frank johnson report
by frank johnson
we were in the west country .
the prime minister wa on his soapbox .
just up the road , at langport in somerset , wa the birthplace of walter bagehot ( 1826â€“1877 ) , although a he directed his microphone at liberal democrat heckler john major had other thing on his mind .
the relevance is that bagehot wa the first political commentator .
the travelling chaos of a modern party leader 's election entourage had carried major within a few mile of the home of the founder of the profession , a few of whose more troublesome contemporary practitioner are said to have caused him much irritation over the 16 month of his premiership .
â€˜ a liberal ?
he 's admitted to being a liberal ! â€™
major cried , jabbing a finger in the direction of one heckler .
the man had a liberal democrat rosette pinned to his cap .
he wa also carrying an orange poster on a pole , urging a vote for the local liberal democrat candidate .
therefore the admission which the prime minister wrung from him could hardly be said to have been grudging .
but , like all the best soapbox orator , major had prepared his repartee in advance .
â€˜ i knew there wa one here , â€™ he continued , meaning liberal democrat .
there were , in fact , about a score .
then came the passage , which appeared on the television news that evening and in the paper the next day , about the liberal democrat being the trojan horse that would let labour in .
there were also some line intended for local consumption : â€˜ higher petrol price from the liberal democrat â€¦ that 's not gon na help a rural area â€¦
â€™ what would bagehot have made of him ?
like the heckler , he wa a liberal .
there the similarity end , since judging from his writing bagehot wa a roaring snob , whereas judging from his heckle the heckler wa not .
more to the point , it wa bagehot who said : â€˜ a constitutional statesman is in general a man of common opinion and uncommon ability . â€™
the statesman to whom he wa referring wa peel .
a political commentator of our own day , paul johnson , quoted it not long after major became prime minister to suggest that it wa also true of him .
but is it still ?
b agehot 's phrase come in a passage in which he appears to propound the dispiriting theory that a politician , if he want to get anywhere , must appeal to â€˜ the average man â€™ .
the average man is â€˜ a cool , common person , with a considerate air , with figure in his mind , with his own business to attend to , with a set of ordinary opinion arising from and suited to ordinary life .
he ca n't bear novelty or originality â€¦
original theory give trouble â€™ .
bagehot go on to say of peel : â€˜ from a certain peculiarity of intellect and fortune , he wa never in advance of his time .
of almost all the great measure with which his name is associated , he attained great eminence a an opponent before he attained even greater eminence a their advocate . â€™
that last sentence ha more to do with kinnock than with major .
it is also a warning to all hack tory who think that it is a telling blow against kinnock to keep on pointing out that he ha reversed his opinion about unilateral nuclear disarmament , british membership of the ec , or anything else .
but the most striking thing about bagehot 's essay on peel , in the light of the last full week of this election campaign , is that it simply doe not apply to major at all .
common opinion were what got major into difficulty in the first place .
between his becoming prime minister and his party 's fall in the poll about 10 day ago , major did nearly everthing that common opinion wanted him to do .
this wa true of what he did about both high policy and low politics .
for example , on high policy common opinion said that there wa nothing for it but to stay in the erm .
he stayed in , and the recession worsened .
in low politics , common opinion â€” no le common for being expensively hired by conservative central office â€” encouraged him in the belief that he should fight much of the election sitting down .
he did so , and he looked like the questioner in the studio audience rather than the answerer .
the result wa wobbly week , the second week of the campaign .
but last saturday major climbed on to that soapbox in luton .
until then , he had been that most inhuman of creature â€” the public figure described by others a â€˜ very human â€™ .
now he really wa human â€” unscripted , jokey , even a bit passionate .
the jubilant word from kinnock 's camp wa that major wa behaving more like an opposition leader than a prime minister .
but there seemed nothing wrong with the head of government appearing to be the challenger on the hustings .
president truman did so in a campaign which no-one expected him to win , and he won .
it is justified if the head of government is challenging something powerful .
kinnock complains of the alleged power of the tory tabloid press , but he ha power on his side too .
ninety per cent of his party 's cash come from the union , which will expect a return .
the british people have in the past found them rather more powerful than the corporation which are popularly supposed to finance the conservative party .
then there are all those schoolteacher , don , television producer , writer on art page and member of the agitating class who want a labour win in order to impose political correctness .
that is to say , they will have what the jesuit once attached such importance to : power over young or impressionable mind .
a the week went by , major rejected common opinion about two other large subject : proportional representation and scottish devolution .
he hardened his opposition to both , despite the fact that his own party chairman had once favoured the first , and vocal force within his scottish party were in support of the second .
e ven at this late hour , psephology , demographic and luck suggest that the tory could still emerge a the biggest single party in a hung parliament .
is it possible that major would rather go into opposition â€” with the danger that would mean for his continued leadership of the conservative party â€” than offer pr and scottish devolution to the liberal democrat ?
if so , we are dealing with a more quixotic , romantic or principled figure than some of u used to think .
once that soapbox came out , major campaigned a if he would now do and say what he really thought .
wa it too late ?
from central office , and from around his entourage , came the unmistakable sign of fair-weather friend preparing to detach themselves from blame for defeat .
and then , on thursday morning , when major 's election tour reached the daily mail ideal home exhibition , sir david english , the paper 's editor , wa not there to greet him .
a junior spin doctor is reported to have muttered , though admittedly out of my earshot : â€˜ we 've been snubbed . â€™
not sir david !
some in the profession of political commentating would opt for bagehot a their formative influence , but mine ha long been sir david â€” a founder of biased tory journalism .
his lack of humbug about political balance ha always made him more honest than all the employee of bbc current affair awaiting with glee the kinnock year .
eventually , sir david 's office issued a statement about the prime minister .
normally , a prime minister 's office would issue a statement about an editor .
but major make a point of not being grand , and with sir david it is the other way about .
â€˜ sir david english wa not informed of the visit and in consequence had no plan to attend the ideal home exhibition that day , â€™ the official statement announced .
faith in sir david 's leadership wa restored .
scientist click over a way to save dolphin
by greg neale environment correspondent
hundred of thousand of dolphin could be saved from death thanks to pioneering work by british scientist .
they believe they have found a cheap , practical mean of preventing dolphin entangling themselves in monofilament drift fishing net â€” the â€˜ wall of death â€™ believed to be responsible for killing large number of dolphin off cornwall this year .
but their work is hampered by lack of money .
so far they have received nothing from the government , little ec assistance and are running out of fund donated by individual and industry .
the researcher , headed by dr margaret klinowska , a cambridge biologist , and david goodson , an expert on acoustic engineering at loughborough university , say new data show that plastic sound reflector to fishing net can warn dolphin of hazard .
data to be published shortly draw on experiment including observation of freddy , the dolphin that ha been living off the northumbrian coast for four year .
using equipment donated by racal , the scientist have analysed recording of the â€˜ clicking â€™ dolphin make while hunting .
observation of freddy led them to conclude that dolphin use sonar while hunting .
they emit an intense , broad-band â€˜ click â€™ or pulse of sound .
echo of the signal alert them to possible prey , at range up to 80â€“90 metre in shallow water .
mr goodson , who became interested in the sonar capacity of dolphin after hearing one while swimming off the welsh coast , ha experimented with various shape of sound reflector .
the most promising is eliptical , about 3â½in long .
the theory is that it internal air pocket will â€˜ bounce â€™ back the dolphin 's sonar signal , regardless of the direction of approach .
last autumn , dr klinowska , mr goodson and their team put the theory into practice .
in the moray firth , they placed a â€˜ headline barrier â€™ , from which they had suspended reflector at two-metre interval .
the movement of dolphin around the barrier wa observed , using electronic equipment to monitor sonar activity .
â€˜ the result exceeded our expectation , â€™ said mr goodson .
dolphin swimming near the barrier altered their behaviour to avoid it , the result , the scientist believe , of them detecting sonar echo from the reflector .
dr klinowska said that , although it wa necessary to be cautious about the finding , a combination of reflector device and some modification of fishing gear might reduce death .
but the moray firth experiment were only possible after the naturalist dr david bellamy helped secure a donation from the co-operative wholesale society .
â€˜ our work is being delayed simply through the lack of funding , â€™ said dr klinowska .
the scientist hope to raise â£100,000 through an appeal by windsor safari park .
donation can be made to the dolphin research project c/o windsor safari park , windsor , berkshire sl4 4ay .
the art : courtroom drama in the case of the bogus picasso

suppose you have a print by picasso , dali , miro or chagall , or sold one in the past few year : you have a special interest in a brooklyn courtroom this week .
hilda amiel , alleged to be the very godmother of fake art , ha been arraigned for her part in what the u attorney call the â€˜ single largest worldwide source and distribution network of bogus print â€™ .
( she pleads not guilty . )
the fed claim to have seized 75,000 print at the family firm , known with a nice irony a original artwork ltd .
they say there were blank sheet bearing dali 's signature alongside 20,000 fake miro and 650 fake chagall .
the picasso , according to sotheby 's valuer , were â€˜ sloppy â€™ .
amiel is the first reputable dealer to be prosecuted , but more than 100 others a well a auction house across america are now under subpoena to explain what they thought they were selling .

the st petersburg national opera ( the â€˜ national â€™ ) , chaliapin 's company , is in new york for the first time .
the management of the kirov , that other opera house in st petersburg , are furious .
the core of the problem is simple : the national wa invited to new york only last november , and the kirov is planning to tour this summer .
both are presenting the great russian warhorse , boris godunov and the queen of spade .
both company expected to bring the bass vladimir ognovenko to sing boris and the mezzo-soprano irina bogatcheva .
( russian singer do n't spend their life with one company any more . )
but kirov 's management , satra art international , felt badly upstaged .
under pressure from satra , kirov told singer to choose between the company .
the national 's boris godunov wa built around ognovenko ; he had to stay home .
the mezzo irina bogatcheva , wife of the national 's artistic director stanislav gaudassinksy , agreed to limit her role .
but that wa n't enough .
for daring to come at all , she wa cut from the kirov team .
she went home in tear at the weekend .
but her husband did have consolation on saturday , a we talked over scotch and peking duck : the sound of american cheer for his robust version of boris godunov .

the art : in the name of charity
by lewis jones
charity is a divine attribute , but we are enjoined to give forgetfully lest we fall into the absurd error of mistaking ourselves for god .
the peril of ignoring this advice were well illustrated by angel of bengal ( c4 ) , the true story documentary by anna raphael which wa by turn hilarious and enraging .
the â€˜ angel â€™ in question wa an american woman who call herself rytasha .
apart from a particularly vicious-looking nose-job and alarming turquoise-coloured contact lens , rytasha is rather beautiful , and in the 1970s , when she went by the name of ricki , she wa a successful model ( she began life a maxine shenkman ) .
an earlier film by raphael , the persuader ( 1986 ) , charted the transformation of ricki into rytasha , which occurred at the hare krishna temple in london , and her uneasy relationship with her guru there .
it would have been interesting to have seen the two film together .
since 1986 rytasha ha broken awaym_from her guru and set up on her own with a charity called food relief international , which raise money from the fiercely competitive matron of palm beach and distributes it to the starving people of bangladesh .
â€˜ she adaws bangladesh , â€™ gushed rytasha 's mother â€” the fiercest matron of them all , rejoicing in the improbable title of baroness thea von theilheimer shenkman .
she went on to list her daughter 's achievement : â€˜ she put in an irritation system â€¦
â€™ with no trace of a smile or a blush the baroness quickly corrected herself â€” â€˜ an irrigation system â€™ â€” but the slip wa a telling one , and i 'm sure they would have appreciated it in bangladesh .
the villager of ramsala , recipient of the palm beach dollar , explained to the camera that they desperately needed a clinic .
â€˜ we told her that a mud hut would do , but she said no , she 'd build something pukka . â€™
a pukka building wa duly erected , but it medical function ha somehow been indefinitely postponed .
it is devoted instead to the worship of the charitable rytasha , who is not content simply to hand over the cash but insists , in an unfortunate hangover from her hare krishna day , on posturing a â€˜ a spiritual master â€™ .
the villager seemed unimpressed , but were given no choice in the matter .
nor could the vaunted irrigation scheme be described a an unqualified success .
the money ran out before the scheme 's completion , and the villager found themselves obliged to borrow the rest .
they begged rytasha for reimbursement , but none wa forthcoming , and for the want of a few hundred pound the village lost it crop for the year .
â€˜ now what are we supposed to do ? â€™ asked one of them .
â€˜ are we to sell our cattle or our land ? â€™
the most irritating thing about rytasha â€” and there were many â€” wa that , though she doe not speak their language , she presumes to teach them a spurious form of their own religion .
â€˜ one thing we do n't need in this subcontinent , â€™ professor rokeya kabeer observed , â€˜ is spiritual guidance â€” we have guru a dime a dozen . â€™
they are far too civilised for that sort of thing in bangladesh , but i kept thinking wistfully of t. s. eliot 's line in sweeney agonistes about â€˜ a nice little white little missionary stew â€™ .
city : lloyd 's member fail in bid to protect cash fund
by karen cooper
more than 800 lloyd 's of london member on syndicate managed by the loss-making gooda walker agency have failed in their legal attempt to prevent lloyd 's and member ' agent from drawing down their fund .
michael freeman , the solicitor who advised the member on court action , said yesterday : â€˜ this will cause the most dreadful hardship .
there is going to be a great deal of pain in the market place now . â€™
in an earlier than expected commercial court judgment , mr justice saville found that the member had not produced enough evidence of irregularity in the â€˜ lmx spiral â€™ , which sends catastrophe risk swirling round the market to stop the usual process of calling on cash deposit to make good syndicate loss .
however , he suggested there wa perhaps a need to look into the system more closely .
cost were awarded to the member ' agent but not to lloyd 's .
the member , many of whom are unable to fulfil the latest â£101m cash call due on march 2 to cover 1989â€“90 loss on syndicate were seeking an interim injunction to stop member ' agent and lloyd 's dipping into their security .
they were challenging the â€˜ pay now sue later â€™ principle at lloyd 's , which say name should pay cash call first and fight them later .
lloyd 's chairman david coleridge welcomed the judgment .
â€˜ we have every sympathy with those who have made substantial underwriting loss in recent year but lloyd 's owes it first duty to policyholder with valid claim which must be met , â€™ he said .
mr freeman said an appeal wa â€˜ most unlikely , because we are not going to get any more evidence . â€™
earlier this month , preliminary finding from an investigation by kenneth randall found that the gooda walker agency may have overstated it syndicate ' profit between 1981 and 1988 through the use of time and distance policy , about which it had failed to inform it auditor in at least one syndicate .
peter nutting , who led the association of outhwaite member to a succesful settlement , said he sympathised with gooda walker name , but â€˜ if the name were not going to pay these call , who did they think wa going to pay them ? â€™
meanwhile , member who were not part of the â£116m outhwaite out-of-court settlement have voted to press their claim for compensation through the 1992 outhwaite name association .
it plan to issue a protective writ but is hoping to achieve a settlement .
â€˜ the nh is not for sale â€™ virginia bottomley talk to george jones in her first interview since joining the cabinet
by george jones
the new health secretary , mr virginia bottomley , set herself an ambitious target yesterday â€” to â€˜ take the politics â€™ out of the national health service .
but her desire to provide a period of stability for nearly one million people employed by the nh is coupled with a fierce determination to maintain the momentum of reform , with the overwhelming majority of hospital becoming self-governing trust by the mid-1990s .
labour sought to turn the general election into a referendum on the nh , asking voter for a mandate to reverse the change .
mr bottomley is convinced the tory victory provides the opportunity to entrench the reform â€” and to give doctor , nurse and manager the confidence to make them work .
in her first full interview since being appointed health secretary , she said the election result , and mr major 's unequivocal commitment to the nh , had finally â€˜ nailed the lie â€™ about privatisation of health care .
â€˜ the nh is not for profit .
it is not for sale .
it will continue to be true to it founding principle , available to all and free at the point of delivery , â€™ she said .
she recalled a promise made by mr major when he became prime minister : that he would work for a nation at ease with itself .
â€˜ i want to see a health service at ease with itself â€” optimistic and confident about it essential work .
health is something which touch every individual and family in the country , â€™ she said .
â€˜ but there must be change .
an organisation that doe n't change fossilises .
health need to develop and alter . â€™
by next year , she is confident that two third of hospital will have become self-governing trust within the nh .
she pledged that the government would safeguard those that did not opt for trust status , but she expected this to be a minority .
the government will also encourage more family doctor to hold budget to â€˜ buy â€™ service for patient , and is looking at way to enable smaller practice to team up to secure the advantage of fund holding .
the election result ha given the conservative five year in which to press ahead with the change .
most people are likely to judge the reform on how long they have to wait for treatment â€” the issue behind the â€˜ jennifer 's ear â€™ controversy during the election campaign .
mr bottomley stressed her commitment to the patient 's charter , which ha already eliminated almost all wait of more than two year for nh operation .
the next step is to ensure that , from march , no one should have to wait more than 18 month for a hip or knee replacement or a cataract operation .
a national standard will also be set for outpatient waiting time .
mr bottomley 's first big test a health secretary will come this summer with the annual public spending round , which will be conducted against a background of concern over high government borrowing and pressure from the tory right for public spending cut .
the conservative manifesto contained a commitment to increase , year by year , the level of â€˜ real resource â€™ committed to the nh â€” though it put no figure on the extra money to be allocated .
mr bottomley , representing â€˜ caring conservatism â€™ , will face mr michael portillo , the new treasury chief secretary , who is equally keen to establish his right-wing credential by demonstrating he can keep keep a tight grip on the public purse string .
she acknowledged that there could be difficult time ahead .
â€˜ it will always be the case that the holder of my office will need to fight the corner of the health service and there will always , inevitably , be more than we can do . â€™
but she stressed there would be no let-up in the search for greater efficiency .
a well a fighting for more money , her task wa to ensure that â€˜ every last pound â€™ wa spent a effectively a it could be .
her priority include giving more encouragement to medical research ; emphasis on preventive health to make the nh a â€˜ health a well a a sickness service â€™ , with the publication shortly of new national target for reducing death from heart disease and cancer ; and pressing ahead with care in the community .
a a former psychiatric social worker , mr bottomley is determined to improve standard of care for mentally ill and handicapped people .
â€˜ it is not acceptable to have people who require a home confined to long-stay institution when they could be in more domestic setting .
that is a real challenge , â€™ she said .
mr bottomley 's rise to the top ha been swift , with only four year between her first ministerial post and a seat at the cabinet table .
but she bridle at suggestion that the inclusion of two woman â€” mr gillian shephard at the department of employment and herself â€” ha excluded more able men from the cabinet .
â€˜ prime minister always have to consider balance in the cabinet â€” and at least we now have the same number of woman a old etonian in john major 's team , â€™ she said .
a non-punitive paradigm of probation practice : some sobering thought l.r. singer
lawrence singer is an assistant chief probation officer with merseyside probation service .
beforehand he worked a a probation officer for berkshire probation service and later a a research officer for somerset probation service where he undertook the research reported here .
the paradigm which is described originates from doctoral research into generic probation practice and ha been presented in a book adult probation and juvenile supervision : beyond the care-control dilemma ( 1989 , gower ) .
summary
the government white paper crime , justice and protecting the public proposes a radical change for probation practice .
henceforth probation work will no longer be an alternative to punishment but an alternative form of punishment .
this article challenge the conceptual and practical appropriateness of applying the notion of punishment to the probation context .
probation officer , it is argued , are concerned with establishing rule for probationer and not inflicting pain on them .
an alternative non-punitive paradigm of probation practice is described .
the paradigm is based on the joint supervisory aim of support and surveillance which are implemented through the method of counselling , assisting , directing , and monitoring .
to illustrate the paradigm , reference is made to an alcohol education course developed for offender in trouble through drink .
the efficacy of the alcohol project and the non-punitive paradigm is demonstrated by the result reported from a three year evaluation study covering 152 offender .
the article concludes with an affirmation of the disciplined but non-punitive character of current probation work and argues that , to successfully protect the public and reintegrate offender into the community , the probation officer 's employment of established social work knowledge , skill , and value is a strength not a weakness .
the aim of this article is to challenge the assertion contained in the white paper crime , justice and protecting the public ( home office , 1990a ) that probation practice can be conceived of a a form of punishment in the community .
issue will be taken with the appropriateness of applying the concept of punishment to the probation context through reference to a demanding and successful probation project concerned with offender in trouble through drink .
in describing the project , a non-punitive model for understanding probation practice will be developed .
this non-punitive paradigm will provide a framework for contrasting the efficacy of current practice with future plan inappropriately to transform probation work into â€˜ a new approach to punishment in the community â€™ ( p. 18 , para. 4.3 ) .
the punitive approach anticipated for the probation service in the white paper is underpinned by a definition of punishment that resides â€˜ in the restriction on liberty and in the enforcement of the order â€™ .
the white paper go on to emphasize : â€˜ it is the loss of liberty involved in carrying out the term of the order rather than the activity carried out during the order which is the punishment â€™ ( p. 18 , para. 4.4 ) .
notwithstanding the popular appeal and political capital to be derived from such a humane-sounding statement , this definition is nevertheless at variance with the traditional understanding of the meaning of punishment .
discourse on punishment and dictionary definition of the term clearly specify the central feature of punishment a being the infliction of pain rather than the loss of liberty per se ( hudson , 1987 ) .
the conceptual and practical implication of this discrepancy will be examined in the third and final section of this article .
beforehand , however , consideration will be given first to the probation project and second to it evaluation .
in these section punishment will be understood to mean the infliction of pain and the review of the project will seek to demonstrate that the probation practice described is not only more demanding but also more effective than this traditional understanding of punishment .
at a time when the home secretary is inviting the probation service to â€˜ move centre stage in the criminal justice system â€™ ( nacro , 1990 , p. 17 ) it may seem misguided and unnecessarily pedantic to take issue with the white paper 's notion of punishment .
punishment is just a word after all : nothing more than convenient political rhetoric meriting only lip-service from probation manager and practitioner poised at the â€˜ window of opportunity â€™ .
however , this fails to acknowledge a fundamental axiom of social work practice ; namely that language not only reflects but also shape social reality .
a davy ( 1981 ) ha pointed out , speech is the basic tool of the social worker .
what we say influence what we think and in turn , what we do .
if punishment is assimilated into the probation glossary it will inevitably influence the sort of practice the service undertakes .
in the section to follow the stark question is therefore put â€˜ is the probation service in the business of inflicting pain ? â€™ and the answer which unfolds may be summarized â€˜ no , because it neither aspires nor wish to ! â€™
the project : more demanding than punishment
government concern about the problem of drink-related offending is a old a the probation service .
indeed , a bochel ( 1976 ) ha shown , the establishment of a probation service in england and wale wa inextricably linked with work undertaken with offender in trouble through drink .
almost a century later the new approach to punishment in the community outlined by the white paper once again present alcohol misuse a a key problem requiring community-based intervention .
â€˜ alcohol â€™ , the white paper state , â€˜ is implicated in a wide variety of crime , drunken driving , offence of public disorder and domestic violence â€™ ( p. 21 , para. 4. 14 ) .
in describing it vision of effective supervision the white paper go on to note :
offender take part in alcohol education programme so that they can learn to drink sensibly .
they learn about the relative strength of different drink , the amount which is safe to consume , and the pitfall to avoid ( e.g. competitive drinking and buying â€˜ round â€™ ) ( p. 37 , para. 7.11 ) .
a a summary of alcohol education programme , this is something of a simplification .
however it doe provide a useful introduction to the origin of the alcohol education course reported here .
furthermore , it highlight the suitability of referring to this type of project for testing out the appropriateness of applying the notion of punishment to probation practice .
in 1985 the management of somerset probation service wa faced with the fact that nearly one in three of the offender supervised in their area were either known to be or suspected of misusing alcohol ( singer , 1985 ) .
aware of practitioner ' frustration in not being able to work effectively with these problematic client , probation management , in partnership with the voluntary sector , determined to develop an alcohol education course ( aec ) .
by 1986 , when social inquiry report monitoring information covering 1,257 offender indicated that the problem of drink-related offending wa virtually a great for pre- a for post-sentence client , that is , alcohol wa cited a a pre-offence problem in twenty-nine per cent of case , a specialist project worker had been appointed .
towards the end of 1986 an aec wa launched and ha been running ever since .
the aim of the course is to educate offender about alcohol to facilitate a lasting change in their subsequent use of this drug .
this aim is underpinned by three interrelated objective and it is not without significance how they complement and serve to implement the white paper 's own trinity of â€˜ aim of supervision â€™ , that is , protection of the public , prevention of reoffending and successful reintegration of the offender in the community ( p. 35 , para. 7.3 ) .
these were :
1 .
to increase knowledge about alcohol so that future alcohol use can be more informed and therefore more prudent .
2 .
to instil or reinforce responsible drinking attitude and behaviour .
3 .
to encourage the maintenance of , or , where appropriate , a reduction to a personally and socially safe level of alcohol unit intake .
to meet these objective the aec ha a structured programme involving group and individual contact , that is , six group session sandwiched between one-to-one interview held immediately before and after the group .
the initial one-to-one meeting , held with one of the two group leader , serf to clarify what participant can expect from the course and what is expected of them .
a standard contract which cover condition of attendance and an agreement to complete various assignment between group session is signed by each participant .
the final interview entail a personalized review of the course , a well a the formulation of a follow-up plan to be undertaken with the offender 's supervising officer .
the course employ a variety of material and technique including the use of checklist , magazine and newspaper clipping , quiz , video , brainstorm exercise , discussion , drink diary , and role play ( menary , 1986 ) .
the aec is primarily intended for young adult subject to a probation order with a special condition of attendance ( schedule 11 4a(ii) criminal justice act 1982 ) and reflects the fact that most somerset offender in trouble through drink commit serious offence and/or posse a substantial number of previous conviction .
in short , they are seriously at risk of committing further offence and becoming trapped in the revolving door of custody .
the development of the somerset aec both accord with and constitutes a practical example of the home office 's recent guidance to sentencers :
in recent year the probation service ha devoted increasing resource to supervising the more serious and persistent offender .
probation order which are combined with constructive , disciplined and effective programme of supervision are increasingly being used for offender who stand to receive custodial sentence ( 1990b , p. 35 ) .
from the description of the aec already given the demanding and disciplined nature of the course can be appreciated .
however , the course is not punitive ; it is not concerned with the infliction of pain .
instead , it is concerned with the establishment of rule .
this is plainly evident from the section of the contract signed by each participant where what is expected of them is spelt out :
you will be expected to keep a drink diary throughout the course , and make attempt at reducing the amount you drink if it is greater than accepted healthy drinking level .
you must be willing to be helped and help others â€” your experience will be useful to other group member .
you must attend 8 session ( these will consist of : an introductory session , six group session and a final assessment interview ) .
you must not drink before the session .
you must be on time â€” lateness will count a an absence .
unlike the prison inmate , aec participant can not sit back and passively do their time .
probation practice is not , however , solely concerned with the establishment of rule .
a ha been demonstrated elsewhere with regard to the generic probation setting ( singer , 1989 ) , the supervision of offender involves two overarching aim : namely support and surveillance .
support refers to anything which is said or done to help the offender solve or mitigate their personal or social problem : surveillance to anything which is said or done to induce the offender to conform to socially acceptable standard of behaviour .
these aim are implemented through the practice of four distinguishable but related method .
in term of support , there is counselling and assisting : in term of surveillance , there is directing and monitoring .
each of these four method are employed during the eight session .
although summarized a an alcohol education course , the session are not just concerned with giving information but also with enabling participant to make practical use of it .
in the first group session the counselling method is registered in the course tutor 's note ( menary , 1986 ) by the explanation : â€˜ this session aim to get participant to consider the subject of alcohol in way they had not thought of in the past â€™ ( p. 3 ) .
during this session the importance of monitoring is also emphasized :
drink exercise introduce the notion of measurement , concentration of alcohol content ; information which will be necessary to carry out the recording of alcohol consumption throughout the duration of the course ( p. 3 ) .
in the fifth group session entitled â€˜ focus on the individual â€™ , the counselling and the monitoring combine with the directing and assisting method .
at the start of the session the tutor 's note make clear that directing extends beyond enforcing the condition of attendance :
this session allows for an in depth examination of the drinking diary over the last five week â€” identifying the risky circumstance or situation â€¦ .
the aim at the end of the session is to encourage participant to make rule for their future drinking which will lead to a lessening of identified problem ( p. 4 ) .
similarly , the assisting extends beyond simply providing handout of useful information :
it is important that participant are provided with the skill to reduce their drinking level or handle more effectively â€˜ pub centred â€™ problem .
the use of role play , incorporating previously discussed difficulty ( i.e. homework assignment session 4 ) in â€˜ real â€™ or set up situation provides an opportunity for testing these skill .
probably the best illustration of the assisting method in action during the course come in the fifth session when somerset practitioner take the logic of working with the problem in the community to it ultimate conclusion .
in the second half of the session , course leader sponsor participant to an evening at the pub for the purpose of practising drinking skill and purchasing non-alcoholic drink .
the counselling , assisting , directing , and monitoring on the aec give substance to the aim of support and surveillance and provide the basis for establishing a model of probation practice .
punishment ha no place in this model .
instead the aec can best be understood a an example of a non-punitive paradigm of probation practice .
twenty year ago the advisory council on the penal system observed that notion of punitiveness do not accord with â€˜ the british concept of probation a an alternative to , rather than a suspension of , punishment â€™ ( quoted in bochel , 1976 , p. 238 ) .
twenty year later the aec demonstrates that this remains no le true now than it wa then .
but doe the aec work ?
bringing fossil back to life
in this chapter some of the way in which palaeontologist determine the way fossil animal lived are described , reanimating the dead fragment to build up a living creature .
since popular idea of life in the past are often founded on vividly coloured reconstruction of â€˜ the world in the jurassic period â€™ and the like , it is important to remember that these imaginative scene are all inference from bone , and similar fragment .
in fact there is nothing fixed about such interpretation , because the way the fossil are understood may change over the year , but it is usually some time before new discovery percolate into the popular presentation .
even the most solid-looking dinosaur may have changed their habit in the last few year !
many different line of evidence may be used to flesh out the bare bone of the fossil .
the first of these is the evidence of the rock from which the remains were recovered .
the sediment themselves reveal much about the environment of deposition , a wa shown in chapter 3 .
it is important to establish whether the fossil animal actually lived in the environment which furnished it sedimentary cover , or whether it remains were swept in from some other place .
fortunately it is usually easy to spot such intruder .
the type of sediment and the associated fossil will show whether the environment wa marine , freshwater or terrestrial , providing the basic information into which the ecology of the animal ha to be accommodated .
the sediment themselves may have preserved some of the track left by the animal ( p. 20 ) to give direct evidence of it past activity .
from the track alone it is possible to be certain of the bipedal stance of certain dinosaur , and to measure their stride .
the character of the rock , and their setting in the past geography at the time when they accumulated , diagnosis the climatic setting in which the extinct fauna lived , and climate imposes certain restraint on possible mode of life .
savannah animal differ from those of tropical rain forest , and these again from inhabitant of the tundra at high latitude .
looking at the fossil animal itself , the first necessity is to reconstruct it a accurately a possible from it fragmentary remains .
sometimes this is a very complex business , particularly for vertebrate with number of small bone .
to proceed from the reconstruction to an assessment of probable life habit two different but complementary approach are used .
one method attempt to compare the structure of teeth or limb or some other feature of the extinct animal with living analogue .
these do not have to be biologically related organism .
the basic argument is that structure that are closely similar were probably adapted to a similar function .
sometimes these similarity are quite obvious : the ferocious teeth of a predatory dinosaur are a sure indication of hunting habit , with hardly a glance at the fang of living mammalian carnivore .
but the structure and functioning of grinding or chewing teeth in other mammal , in which opposing teeth co-operate in action , and which can be matched in extinct , unrelated mammal , is a much more subtle matter , involving detailed study on the operation of living dental system to help elucidate the functioning of fossil one .
the technique of â€˜ hunt the analogue â€™ is a favourite one practised by palaeontologist , but it is certainly not a foolproof one , because there are many fossil animal that defy comparison with living organism , and some analogue do not stand up to detailed scrutiny .
the second method try to analyse the structure of the fossil almost a if it were a piece of engineering .
if the fossil is constructed in a certain way , then there are only a limited number of â€˜ job â€™ that the structure could perform .
the idea here is to decide which of the possibility is the most likely one .
this assumes that nature only manufacture efficient design .
for the most part this is a reasonable assumption to make .
most animal today do seem to have body that accord well with the function they have to carry out to survive : flyer are aerodynamically efficient , active swimmer have suitable streamlining , herbivorous mammal have teeth appropriate for grinding plant food , and so on .
ideally one could construct a model of the fossil to test out these various function in experiment , but the number of example where the analysis ha been pursued this far are limited .
of course it can never be known whether the right answer ha been reached ( unless somebody dredge up a â€˜ living fossil â€™ from the depth of the ocean ) â€” there are only varying degree of probability .
but the best answer are probably obtained where the functional design of the fossil point to the same life habit a a living analogue , and where both are consistent with the geological circumstance in which the fossil remains occur .
swimming trilobite
there are thousand of different kind of trilobite .
all of them were marine and all of them are extinct .
since many kind of trilobite co-existed at any one time they were probably occupying different ecological niche , behaving in different way , corresponding with the wide variation in shape that they show .
we can use the method described above to elucidate some of these occupation , and get a glimpse , albeit an imperfect one , of the trilobite a it lived .
i will take an example where all the method can be used , and where all point in the same direction , so that the answer is probably correct .
most trilobite were broadly oval-shaped being rather longer than wide , not greatly convex , and with eye that occupy perhaps a quarter of the length of the head .
there are a few trilobite specie , however , with enormous , globular eye ( see below ) .
by examining the way these animal were put together it is possible to suggest a likely mode of life .
giant-eyed ordovician trilobite , seen from the top and side .
twice it natural size .
enlargement show a section through the lens to show the direction of the field of view .
we can take the eye first .
the trilobite eye wa of a compound type , and each lens wa made up of a calcite crystal .
from the optical property of this mineral we know that the lens wa able to interpret light coming from a direction more or le at right-angles to the lens surface .
so we can deduce what the field of vision of our globular-eyed trilobite wa , by looking at the direction in which all the lens face .
it turn out that our animal wa able to see in almost every direction â€” upwards , downwards , sideways and forward , and even backwards , because the eye bulged out beyond the line of the rest of the body .
most other trilobite have a predominantly lateral field of view .
if the animal lived on the sea bottom , it seems unlikely that it would have eye lens specialized for looking downwards , and we begin to suspect that the animal habitually dwelt above the sea floor .
other feature of it shape are consistent with this .
at theâ€“ edge of the eye are a pair of long spine , and these point downwards at a steep angle , at very awkward attitude for resting comfortably on the sea floor .
most â€˜ normal â€™ trilobite have a more or le horizontal rim around the forward margin , which may have rested on the sediment surface .
the thorax of the large-eyed trilobite is remarkably long compared with the average trilobite ( compare fig. 33 ) .
the convex , middle part of the thorax contained the musculature that operated the appendage ( which , a usual , are not preserved ) , and the relatively large volume of this region show that the musculature wa powerful .
the construction of this giant-eyed trilobite suggests that it lived an actively swimming life well above the bottom , and possibly in the surface water of the sea .
of course because there are no living trilobite we can not find direct confirmation of this hypothesis , but we can look for other arthropod that have the same modification of the eye , for example , in the present day ocean .
the analogy is found in such ocean-going amphipod ( a kind of â€˜ shrimp â€™ ) a cystosoma , which also ha enormously expanded eye , looking like headlamp , compared with it bottom-dwelling relative ( see above ) .
in fact many of the arthropod that inhabit the water column have large , globular eye of this kind .

giant-eyed living crustacean ( cystosoma )
if it is correct that our trilobite lived above the sea bottom , actively swimming in the water , there are certain prediction we can make about it geological occurrence which can be tested by looking in the rock .
most bottom-dwelling trilobite preferred to live at a particular water depth , or on a particular type of sea bottom ( mud , sand or lime ) .
no such restriction should apply to our large-eyed specie ; it should be found with all other different kind of trilobite assemblage without preference .
this ha been proved in several place : in some arctic locality it is found with trilobite that lived at great depth in the mud of the ordovician ocean , while in canada the same specie occurs mixed with the inhabitant of the shallow-water sea , where limestone were accumulating .
by the same token the free-swimming trilobite may be expected to have a very wide geographical distribution , for ocean would be no barrier to it .
and again this prof to be the case : our example is found in arctic canada , in the high arctic island of spitsbergen , thousand of mile away in what is now the desert country of nevada and utah in the united state , in western ireland , in russia , and in northwestern australia .
so in this case the different source of evidence all point in the same direction , whether derived from a detailed consideration of the way the trilobite is constructed , or by analogy with living animal with similar adaptation , or from the evidence of the rock or the distribution of the fossil .
these giant-eyed trilobite of the ordovician were active swimmer in the surface water , a near certainly a we can ever know .
there are all kind of different question we can ask about the life habit of these trilobite , which are not subject to the same kind of careful scrutiny .
what did they eat , for example ?
because we do not have the leg preserved , it is not possible to see how the mouth appendage functioned in feeding , and neither are the stomach content preserved .
so here there are only more or le likely speculation .
active swimmer in the surface water of the present ocean are likely to feed directly on the plankton , and the trilobite may have had a method of harvesting large quantity of minute food .
or they may have been hunter after larger prey , in which case when appendage are eventually discovered they may prove to have adaptation for grasping and manipulating larger food .
puzzle remain , even though we can be certain of the rudiment of the story .
controversy among the giant dinosaur
the giant sauropod dinosaur like brachiosaurus were the largest land animal the world ha seen they weighed more than 80 tonne and present quite different problem in the interpretation of their life habit from the diminutive trilobite .
such spectacular animal have obviously attracted much attention , and one might suppose that the problem of how they lived would have been satisfactorily solved long ago .
most of the popular book showing the mesozoic giant in their natural setting portray them wallowing about in swamp flanked by deep vegetation , their body largely under water .
surely an animal of this bulk , it wa argued , must be partly supported by water , and their relatively inconsequential teeth must have been adapted for chewing on the kind of soft , luxuriant vegetation that flourish in and around swamp .
because their nasal opening were on the top of their head they could even continue to breathe if it became necessary ( see p. 115 ) to totally submerge .
recently the life habit of the giant have been looked at in a way that disproves most of these traditional notion .
consider the structure of their leg .
the sauropod have relatively long , pillar-like leg , resembling those of the elephant , the largest living land animal , and may have been well adapted for supporting the huge bulk of the animal .
the foot of the sauropod are small ( relatively speaking ! ) , with short , stubby toe , yet animal that walk on soft mud tend to have spreading foot to distribute their weight more evenly .
it is difficult to see how the compact foot of the sauropod could avoid becoming stuck fast in the soft , muddy bottom of a lake .
if the dinosaur did , after all , live on dry land , then the long neck could have usefully functioned to allow the animal to browse the high foliage of tree ( see p. 116 ) .
it ha been suggested that an animal of the size of brachiosaurus could not have breathed under water because of the pressure on the lung .
their fossil remains seem to occur with other animal and plant , which are generally accepted a terrestrial .
there is even some evidence from the track they have left behind that diplodocus and it ally moved about in herd .
they may have been the gigantic reptilian analogue of the elephant , and it may be no coincidence that the elephant also ha it nasal opening on top of the skull , with the nostril in this case sited at the end of the trunk it ha been suggested that some sauropod may have had a proboscis of some sort .
the balance of evidence seems to be swinging away from the original idea of swamp-dwelling giant dinosaur to fully terrestrial habit .
but other aspect of the dinosaur living habit are still more strongly debated .
in the last few year a powerful controversy ha arisen over whether the dinosaur a a whole were cold-blooded , like all living reptile ( and there is no doubt that dinosaur were reptile ) , or warm-blooded , resembling mammal in this respect .
cold-blooded animal have to â€˜ warm up â€™ before they can be fully active ; that is why lizard and snake bask in the sun in temperate climate .
for this reason they can not cope with climate having greatly extended winter .
warm-blooded animal have the same body temperature at all time , and can be more continuously active , but they use far more energy â€” and hence need more food â€” than cold-blooded animal of the same size .
the posture of many dinosaur , and particularly the carnivorous theropod dinosaur , wa fully erect with the leg beneath the body , and unlike the sprawling leg of living reptile ( see p. 116 ) .
the long back leg of such hunter look highly suitable for running , and a they did so the long tail may have been held erect a a kind of counter-balance ( see p. 116 ) .
for any kind of prolonged activity , warm-bloodedness would have been a distinct advantage .
under the microscope even the bone structure of these dinosaur look more like that of living mammal than cold-blooded reptile .
on the other hand it can be argued that the sauropod like brachiosaurus were so large , and with a relatively small surface area through which to cool compared with their enormous volume , that their cooling rate could have been slow enough to allow them to sustain more continuous activity than smaller , living reptile .
it ha also been argued that the small mouth of the giant simply could not have downed enough food to support a warm-blooded metabolism , particularly plant food that need a lot of processing before it becomes available a energy .
the armoured or plated dinosaur include some specie that seem too heavily burdened with protective armour to have been very active , but this doe not necessarily mean that they had to be cold-blooded .
protagonist of the warm-blooded theory will show some of the horned dinosaur charging over the cretaceous plain like furious reptilian rhinoceros !
one idea about the life habit of the dinosaur giant , published in joc and colette at the natural history museum in 1935
the warm-blooded supporter tend to ally themselves with the supporter of a theory about the relationship of the dinosaur .
this is that the dinosaur , or a close dinosaur relative , included the ancestor of the living bird .
some of the smaller , and most certainly highly active dinosaur were about the size of a chicken , and there is more than a passing similarity between a running ostrich and the kind of reconstruction that show fleet-footed , running dinosaur .
the point is that bird themselves are warm-blooded , like mammal , and if bird and dinosaur are a closely related a now seems likely , then it obviously increase the likelihood that the dinosaur themselves may have been warm-blooded .
the pro and con of this theory are the subject of much contentious debate by expert , but it would probably be correct to say that the greater number of specialist believe that at least the more bipedal of the dinosaur , including small and large carnivore , were warm-blooded , active animal .
a lot of the argument among the authority on these animal is about the equivalence or otherwise of certain bone in dinosaur and bird skeleton ( and particularly the jurassic bird archaeopteryx ) ; this make for rather dry reading for the layman .
but the end-product is the accurate reconstruction of the jurassic and cretaceous terrestrial world , over which the dinosaur were indisputably dominant .
action and inaction in the city
susanne macgregor and ben pimlott
the essay in this book do not amount to a programme : but they are intended to provide a springboard for one .
the aim is to analyse a problem which economic growth alone ha failed to cure â€” and to consider possible new form of public action .
the biggest single difficulty in drawing attention to urban poverty is that it is not new , but simply â€” in some of it most worrying manifestation â€” getting worse .
like the poor themselves , the inner city ha long been with u .
ever since the industrial revolution created a mass urban society , the condition of the poorest city dweller have given rise to anxiety among the better off .
the inner city ha been variously regarded a a cause for moral outrage , a threat to public order , or a a stain on the nation 's conscience .
meanwhile bad housing , bad sanitation , lack of education , and other perennial ill associated with overcrowding and poverty have been routinely denounced by political leader and social reformer .
a central objective of the post-war welfare state wa , indeed , to alleviate the problem of the urban poor , over whom beveridge 's five giant ( want , disease , ignorance , squalor , and idleness ) had for so long held sway .
in the early 1940s and 1950s , the belief wa widely held that a combination of government intervention â€” in the form of town planning , housing and health programme , and the provision of social security â€” and permanent male full employment , together with an increase in real wage , would reduce suffering due to poverty to manageable proportion .
the 1964 labour government wa elected on a tide of impatience at the slackening pace of social reform , but also of optimism that little more than economic growth , fuelled by technological change , wa needed to remove the main cause of urban deprivation ( macgregor , 1981 ) .
disillusion swiftly followed .
the work of peter townsend and others showed that , far from presiding over the elimination of poverty , the wilson government actually failed to prevent some of it feature from worsening ( townsend and bosanquet , 1972 ) .
evidence began to mount that much of the social welfare paternalism of the post-war period had created almost a many problem a it solved .
neither the butler education act of 1944 , nor the introduction of comprehensive school , prevented a high proportion of child from under-achieving .
post-war reconstruction and housing programme seemed to do nothing to prevent , and seemed even to encourage , a rise in crime and mental illness .
meanwhile , in many part of the country , a problem a old a city themselves â€” tension between cultural group , between earlier immigrant and newer one , between black , brown , and white , and ( increasingly ) between large section of urban youth and the police â€” came to be identified a the key inner-city issue .
rising unemployment turned a lingering and growing malaise into a crisis .
a in the united state , so in britain it wa an outbreak of violence that dramatically brought the plight of the inner city to public notice .
in the early 1980s , at a time when manufacturing industry wa collapsing and the outlook for the unskilled looked particularly bleak , frustration boiled over in a series of riot in london , bristol , birmingham , liverpool , and elsewhere .
all were spontaneous outburst : none , contrary to some claim , were politically inspired or orchestrated ( except in northern ireland where urban problem existed on a grander , more devastating scale , and where there wa a unique heritage ) .
many had an â€˜ ethnic â€™ dimension , in the sense that many of the rioter were black .
unlike , however , the 1958 notting hill riot , few of those involved were immigrant â€” the vast majority were british born .
and the disturbance could not strictly be called racial : the most prominent feature wa that of violent clash between young people and the police .
the problem , however , were not confined to violent upheaval of this kind .
paul harrison 's inside the inner city : life under the cutting edge focused on hackney , a london borough ranked among the worst off on any scale of urban deprivation ( harrison , 1983 ) .
harrison describes ( p. 369 ) the way in which the inner urban powder-keg lead to a vicious circle , with many victim , but few individual villain :
the police force face the virtually impossible task of keeping the lid on the explosive mixture of ingredient that the dynamic of british society have assembled in the inner city .
this mixture , heated by recession and high unemployment , inevitably generates a high level of crime .
this necessitates , in turn , a far more numerous and ubiquitous police presence than in other kind of area , far more frequent unpleasant contact with the public a potential suspect , and far greater opportunity for police misjudgment or abuse .
the inevitable sufferer , of course , are the poor , of whom those who actually commit the offence that concern the police are a tiny minority and whom , indeed , it should be the purpose of the police to protect .
not only are the most disadvantaged on the receiving end of most crime , argues harrison , they also have to put up with the heaviest police presence .
they are more likely to be stopped and searched , and to be the victim of mistaken arrest or conviction .
at the same time , the resident of the poorest area have to suffer , in a way that is not true of those who live elsewhere , a growing fear of attack on themselves or their property .
improved police method might help , writes harrison , to contain the problem .
but , without other change , the result is likely to be a â€˜ society of barricaded self-defence , and a steady erosion of civil liberty â€™ .
and he concludes , â€˜ of all the warning that the inner city ha to offer for the direction british society is taking , this is perhaps the most sinister â€™ .
harrison 's vision of a nightmarish future for inner city , locked in a cold or hot war between have-not and the force of public order , wa echoed by robert chesshyre ( 1987 , p. 95 ) , who concluded that by the late 1980s :
the basic social contract , whereby citizen enjoy certain right â€” including health care , decent education and housing and a job â€” in return for which they observe the rule of law , wa breaking down .
a a consequence an underclass wa evolving â€” football hooligan , mugger , inner city rioter â€” somewhat more frightening than their dickensian forebear because they were mobile and all too visible .
recently , of course , there ha been an added dimension â€” part media-and-politician inflated , part real : drug .
the spiral in drug abuse and trafficking , with direct consequence for the aid epidemic , ha created a new kind of alarm .
the early 1980s witnessed a radical change in pattern of heroin taking , alongside the global increase .
smoking heroin ( â€˜ chasing the dragon â€™ ) wa one feature of the upsurge .
another wa the increased availability of , and demand for , cocaine .
sensational medium and police report in 1989 seemed to suggest an increased use of â€˜ crack â€™ among young people in part of south london , liverpool , and birmingham â€” with attendant fear that this particularly dangerous substance might become widespread , a it wa reported to be in part of the united state .
for the moment , however , the pattern of drug abuse in britain remains a varied a ever â€” with home-produced drug such a amphetamine a serious a problem a those that hit the headline .
it is a symptom of public anxiety about urban squalor â€” and , le creditably , of class and racial prejudice â€” that â€˜ drug â€™ and â€˜ inner city â€™ are automatically linked in the popular consciousness ( macgregor , 1989a ) .
nevertheless , drug-taking and more particularly the disruptive social consequence of addiction , are especially serious in area of city poverty ( burr , 1989 ) .
in short , if life wa always harder in the inner city than elsewhere , and if condition may temporarily have been alleviated by the impact of the welfare state and rising income , the last decade ha been widely represented a a period of deterioration .
moreover , few would dispute that this apparent decline is a reality : the first word of the prime minister herself , after the result of the 1987 election wa known , were an acknowledgement of the challenge posed to government by the â€˜ inner city â€™ .
what ha been lacking however â€” a well a the political will to do something â€” ha been any shared agreement on the cause .
can the problem of urban poverty be blamed on individual pathology ?
on feckless parent and grandparent ?
or on the social or physical environment â€” the replacement of companionably unhygienic slum by soulless tower block with broken lift ( coleman et al . ,
1985 ) ?
or would a simple injection of resource transform kafkaesque honeycomb into happy living-spaces , with a consequent decline in inner-city ill ?
â€˜ a duke can live comfortably in a castle , after all â€™ , the architect cedric price is quoted a saying .
â€˜ you and i would die of frostbite .
same building â€” just a matter of money and management â€™ ( parkin , 1989 ) .
the view that only â€˜ outstanding management â€™ could meet the problem wa held by the audit commission ( 1987 ) .
the picture painted by the commission 's report on inner london is a gruesome a any ever presented ( and is itself revealing of common prejudice in it choice of indicator of deprivation ) :
in some london borough , unemployment among young men exceeds 45% ; in some place , among young black , it exceeds 60% .
more than one child in three is born into a single parent family .
half the school leaver have no o level or their cse equivalent .
homelessness , housing condition , crime are worsening year by year , a the cycle of urban deprivation becomes more established ( p. 1 )
drawing on north american experience , the commission concluded that â€˜ poor management wa an important contributory factor to new york 's problem â€™ , and sought to apply the same lesson here ( p. 2 ) .
the government 's post-1987 initiative have , to some extent , reflected a diagnosis based on the need for better management â€” though on the principle that central authority can provide a firmer grip than local one â€” but combined with an anti-collectivist belief in the restorative power of capitalism .
leech and amin ( 1988 , p. 14 ) summarize this approach , not unfairly , in the following term :
the encouragement of private investment and the liberation of the market ; the containment of the force of social discontent ; the control of the power of the local authority ; and the encouragement of the movement of the wealthy into the inner city thus creating buffer area of tory support , accentuating inequality and injustice and ( hopefully though not necessarily ) reducing the potential for conflict among the urban poor .
the main thrust of the government 's policy is contained in the january 1988 white paper on regional policy and the enterprise economy , in the new employment training programme , and especially in the march 1988 action for city programme â€” all resting on wider reform to local government structure and finance , and to education and housing .
the most striking feature of this package , apart from it aim actively to involve employer and entrepreneur , is a sharp reduction in the role of local government .
despite the contemporary tone of much of action for city , the programme 's heritage can be traced to the early 1960s study which provided the basis for the 1965 milnerâ€“holland report on housing and the 1967 plowden report on education , a a result of which general improvement area and education priority area were established .
the 1970s â€˜ urban programme â€™ had a social , rather than economic , emphasis and wa administered by the home office .
it wa initiated partly in response to the furore caused by enoch powell 's 1969 â€˜ river of blood â€™ speech , much a disturbance at the 1976 notting hill carnival prompted further step on the part of the department of the environment â€” â€˜ a riot make a much bigger impact on government thinking â€™ , a donnison ( 1987 ) ha pointed out , â€˜ than any amount of earnest and accurate research â€™ .
the urban programme consisted of grant and initiative under the 1969 local government grant ( social need ) act , which wa intended a a flexible instrument to provide supplementary help to local authority in the field of housing , education , and health .
originally , the programme supplemented existing central and local government scheme designed to meet special need in urban area .
the scope wa extended in an â€˜ enhanced â€™ urban programme , which included economic and environmental a well a social project , and wa specifically directed at the inner urban area where the problem were most severe .
earlier , the change of emphasis from a â€˜ social â€™ to an â€˜ economic and environmental â€™ focus had been reflected in a switch of responsibility for the programme from the home office to the department of the environment .
the â€˜ enhanced programme resulted from the 1978 inner urban area act , based on a white paper , published the previous year , on policy for the inner city ( doe , 1977 ) , the first comprehensive policy statement on the subject to acknowledge it a a definable and cohesive problem .
the white paper drew on study conducted earlier in the decade in liverpool , birmingham , and london which pointed to a debilitating flight of capital and skilled labour from the critical area of deprivation .
a key aspect of the 1977 white paper wa the stress it placed on the wider effect of poverty : that it wa not just those with acute need who suffered .
it argued that in talking about inner city it wa vital to think in term not just of individual , but of society ; that the multiple deprivation of the worst hit area affected all the resident ; that the consequence included a pervasive sense of neglect and decay , a decline in community spirit , a low standard of neighbourhood facility , and an increase in crime and vandalism ; and that , without government intervention , the future wa one of reduced job opportunity , deteriorating housing , and a decline in public service .
the document , and the legislation that derived from it , pointed to a positively discriminatory approach : with both central and local government supplementing existing programme in such a way a to strengthen local economy , a well a the physical and social environment .
such measure constituted the present government 's heritage , when it took office in 1979 .
none of them , of course , anticipated the scale of the problem which were caused by the slump and collapse of much of what remained of inner urban manufacturing industry in the early 1980s .
neither , at first , did the incoming administration foresee the impact of rising unemployment , which wa to be especially serious among the urban young .
true , the new secretary of state for the environment laid stress , from the outset , on the need for economic regeneration , and indicated his sympathy for the voluntary sector in the tackling of urban problem .
the previous government , however , had already pointed to the need to revitalize urban economy , and at first the shift wa more rhetorical than real .
michael heseltine ( 1987 , p. 138 ) ha since claimed that â€˜ we set a new objective : to make the inner city place where people would want to live and work and where the private investor would be willing to put his money â€™ .
partnership became his slogan â€” the partnership of public and private brain and money .
a new urban development grant wa devised , to pump-prime with public fund scheme which would then attract private investment .
heseltine 's vision wa of â€˜ partnership which recognise that there are some thing that only government can pay for , but also that the ingenuity and flexibility of the private sector is indispensable â€™ ( p. 156 ) .
he claim that serious work on inner-city policy began in 1979 : but it wa , undoubtedly , the riot of 1981 , coinciding with the biggest drop in employment and job vacancy since the war , which gave impetus to the new approach .
urban development corporation were introduced in 1981 in london docklands and merseyside , and the urban development grant came in late the following year .
conservative instinct were , of course , to minimize â€” within the â€˜ partnership â€” state involvement and expenditure , relative to that of private enterprise .
yet , the irony of the early 1980s â€” a a deteriorating , but perennial , urban problem rapidly became the most acute aspect of the crisis of mass unemployment â€” wa that a tory government , willy-nilly , found itself presiding over an increase in state intervention through a variety of agency .
the increased scale of operation also ushered in another fashion of the 1980s â€” new management structure .
thus in 1985 city action> team were introduced to each â€˜ inner city partnership â€™ area to co-ordinate the work of the three government department involved .
task force , meanwhile , were directed to tackle youth unemployment .
by 1986/7 the urban programme wa supporting 1,380 starter unit and 400 business start in enterprise workshop .
it wa providing 27,500 training place ( often in conjunction with the manpower service commission ) : some 2,500 building were being improved ; estate action aimed to tackle run down housing ; and a large number of new â€˜ partnership â€™ ( which some might see a subsidy , or discredited regional grant , in a new guise ) were in operation , in an effort to bring private investment to run-down urban area .
by 1988 it wa claimed that â£200 million of urban development grant and urban regeneration grant had successfully â€˜ levered â€™ more than â£800 million of private investment into the inner city ( although how much of the latter sum might have been invested in any case is difficult to say ) .
meanwhile , there were other incentive scheme â€” enterprise zone , for example , and simplified planning zone , which aimed to lift tax and planning â€˜ barrier â€™ in order to facilitate investment .
indeed , while with one hand trying to hold down expenditure by local authority , the government found itself by the late 1980s involved with the other hand in massive ear-marked spending on inner urban area .
the department of the environment alone by 1988 wa spending half a billion pound out of an action for city total , involving most home department , estimated at â£3 billion .
perhaps a labour government would have spent even more : it would certainly have spent it in different way .
it is a curious comment on thatcherism , however , that the administration most committed to a reduction in the role of the state , and in the need for an independent private sector , ha spent more on specific urban regeneration and employment scheme and incentive to private investment in urban area than any other in recent history .
one of the most bizarre aspect of government policy ha been the effective murder of the voluntary sector , and it appropriation , by subterfuge , into the tory version of the corporate state .
conservative have always lauded the â€˜ voluntarist â€™ principle in welfare , and encouraged it from platform .
faced , however , with the catastrophic increase in unemployment and the need to occupy large number of workless people without directly employing them ( which would have run counter to the economic doctrine which had led to the redundancy of many of them in the first place ) , the government poured money into any â€˜ voluntary â€™ agency willing to put in a bid for government-funded cheap labour .
one result wa the triumphant expansion of some charitable organization , which rejoiced both at their new-found importance and at the government 's munificence .
another wa the transformation of many such body , already heavily subsidized from public fund , into de facto agency of the state , which financed them and indirectly determined their policy .
nowhere wa the impact of this clumsy sleight of hand more evident than in the inner city , where voluntary organization had been most active , and where the government wa most anxious for them to mop up unemployment .
however , the later withdrawal of government support , with the scrapping of the community programme a unemployment receded , left many of these voluntary organization high and dry .
the national council for voluntary organization ( ncvo ) ha suggested from a recent survey that around 3,000 project had been affected and had lost â£285 million in funding ( macgregor , 1990 ) .
there wa , of course , a crucial element in the government 's anxiety : the high concentration of ethnic minority in the area of concern .
in 1981 nearly 40 per cent of ethnic minority in the uk lived in â€˜ partnership â€™ or â€˜ programme â€™ area .
there is a danger in reading back from this figure another stereotype , similar to the pavlovian â€˜ drug addiction/inner city â€™ assumed link .
some urban area have serious problem without a major ethnic dimension ( newcastle , teesside ) ; not all member of ethnic minority are poor or deprived .
nevertheless , the high proportion of inner urban population composed of people from ethnic minority , and the high incidence among these group of all the index of poverty and social and environmental hardship â€” combined with the specific problem of inter-racial rivalry , harassment , and tension â€” make race and ethnicity an aspect that is central to any analysis of the inner city and of any ameliorative approach .
making sense of the 1981 riot
reaction to the riot have concentrated on a number of key variable that are said to characterize the locality in which the riot have occurred .
lord scarman 's report on the 1981 disorder highlighted the importance of unemployment , urban deprivation , racial disadvantage , relation between young black and the police , the decline of civic consent , and political exclusion a the key issue .
other reaction have concentrated on the issue of the interplay between inner-city decay and racial disadvantage in contemporary britain .
yet others have argued that the unrest can be seen a a symptom of the breakdown of law and order in british society ( gaffney , 1987 ; hall , 1987 ; keith , 1987 ) .
the main issue that were prominent in debate during 1980â€“1 were â€˜ race â€™ and â€˜ law and order â€™ .
this wa by no mean an accident , since throughout the 1970s a powerful body of medium , political , and academic opinion had been constructed around the theme of how britain wa drifting into a â€˜ violent society â€™ , and how the basis of consent wa being shifted by the pressure of immigration and the growth of multi-racial inner city area .
a glimpse of the impact of the 1980â€“1 riot at this level can be achieved through two important debate in parliament .
the first took place in the midst of the july 1981 riot , and had a it theme : â€˜ civil disturbance â€™ .
the tone of the debate wa set by home secretary william whitelaw 's introductory statement in which he spoke of ( a ) the need to â€˜ remove the scourge of criminal violence from our street â€™ , and ( b ) the urgency of developing â€˜ policy designed to promote the mutual tolerance and understanding upon which the whole future of a free democratic society depends â€™ ( hansard , vol. 8 , 16 july 1981 : col. 1405 ) .
the â€˜ scourge of criminal violence â€™ wa , whitelaw argued , a danger to the whole framework of consent and legality on which the political institution of british society were based .
in reply roy hattersley supported the call for the immediate suppression of street violence , but warned that the root of such riot could not be dealt with until all people felt they had a stake in british society ( ibid. : cols. 1407â€“9 )
the second debate took place on 26 november 1981 , on the publication of the scarman report , and had a it theme : â€˜ law and order â€™ .
the importance of the riot in pushing the law and order issue , and specifically policing , on to the main political agenda wa emphasized by the liberal leader , david steel , who argued that â€˜ urgent action â€™ to prevent a drift into lawlessness wa necessary from both a moral and a political perspective ( hansard , vol. 13 , 26 november 1981 : cols. 1009â€“11 ) .
a subsequent debate on the same issue in march 1982 wa also full of reference to the experience of 1981 , the impact of street violence , crime , decaying urban condition , the breakdown of consent between the police and many local community , and the spectre of â€˜ more violence to come â€™ if change in both policing tactic and social policy were not swiftly introduced ( hansard , vol. 20 , 25 march 1982 : cols. 1107â€“81 ) .
the need to support the police wa accepted by both the labour and the conservative speaker in the parliamentary debate on the riot , and wa established a a benchmark for the official response to the riot long before the scarman report wa published in november 1981 .
any substantive disagreement centred around the issue of what role social deprivation and unemployment had in bringing young people to protest violently on the street .
intermingled with the discourse about race and law and order were constant reference to unemployment , particularly among the young , and various form of social disadvantage and poverty ( solomos , 1988 , pp. 186â€“911 ) .
throughout 1980 and 1981 debate about the riot in the medium , in parliament , and in various official report hinged around the interrelationship between racial , law-and-order , and social factor .
the importance of this debate can be explained , partly , by the political capital which the opposition could make from linking the social and economic malaise of the country at large with violent street disturbance .
conversely , throughout this period government minister strenuously denied that unemployment and social deprivation were significant cause of urban unrest .
although the scarman report is often taken to be the central text which argues for a link between â€˜ social condition â€™ and â€˜ disorder â€™ , the term of the debate were by no mean set by scarman .
during both april and july 1981 vigorous exchange took place in the press and in parliament about the role that deteriorating social condition and unemployment may have played in bringing about the riot .
during the 16 july parliamentary debate on â€˜ civil disturbance â€™ , roy hattersley 's formulation of this linkage provided a useful summary of the â€˜ social condition â€™ argument .
after some preliminary remark about the labour party 's support for the police , he went on to outline his opposition to the view of the riot a essentially anti-police outburst :
i repeat that l do not believe that the principal cause of last week 's riot wa the conduct of the police .
it wa the condition of deprivation and despair in the decaying area of our old city â€” area in which the brixton and toxteth riot took place , and area from which the skinhead invader of southall come .
( hansard , vol. 8 , 16 july 1981 : col. 1408 )
much of the subsequent controversy about this analysis centred on the question of youth unemployment .
hattersley had suggested that the riot were a â€˜ direct product â€™ of high level of youth unemployment , and a furious debate ensued in both parliament and the medium about this assertion .
the final symbolic cue used to make sense of the 1980â€“1 protest is more difficult to categorize , but it basic meaning can be captured by the term â€˜ political marginality â€™ .
while a number of discussion of the root of urban unrest in the united state have noted the salience of political marginality in determining participation in violent protest ( skolnick , 1969 ; fogelson , 1971 ; edelman , 1971 ; knopf , 1975 ) , this issue ha received relatively little attention in britain .
nevertheless , during the 1980â€“1 event and their aftermath the political context wa discussed from a number of perspective .
the scarman report , for example , located part of the explanation for the riot in the feeling of alienation and powerlessness which were experienced by young black living in depressed inner-city area .
a successful policy for tackling the root of urban disorder wa seen a one which sought to involve all the community in dealing with the problem of each area so that they could come to feel that they have a stake in it future ( scarman , 1981 , para. 6.42 ) .
where such argument did not fit in with the overarching theme of race , violence and disorder , and social deprivation they were either sidelined or pushed into the sub-clauses of official report .
the scarman report , for example , contained the following policy proposal : â€˜ i recommend that local community must be fully and effectively involved in planning , in the provision of local service , and in the management and financing of specific project , ( scarman , 1981 , para. 8.44 ) .
such a move towards greater political integration wa seen by lord scarman a essential if the gap between inner-city resident and the force of law and order wa to be bridged .
but the concern with overcoming political marginality remained on the sideline of the main public debate because it questioned the perception of the rioter a driven by irrational , uncivilized , and criminal instinct .
this did not , however , stop the question of political marginality and the need to reform existing policy from being raised at all , a can be seen subsequently by the attempt after 1981 to introduce both locally and nationally measure which were meant to address some of the grievance of the rioter and to ensure that further disturbance did not occur .
aspect of these measure are considered further on in the chapter .
perspective on the 1985 riot
despite widespread prediction of further unrest in the aftermath of 1981 , the scale and the location of the 1985 riot seem to have surprised even some of the most astute commentator .
handsworth , for example , wa presented even shortly before september 1985 a a â€˜ success story â€™ in term of police â€” community relation .
the outbreak of violence in this area wa therefore widely presented a an aberration .
similarly the spread of violence in london to area such a the broadwater farm estate in tottenham wa seen a a break from previous experience , which had centred on area such a brixton .
there are many continuity between 1980â€“1 and 1985 in relation to the common-sense image used in the press and television to cover the event .
but response in 1985 were different , at least in term of degree , and probably in relation to the extent to which the riot were seen a a â€˜ race â€™ phenomenon by a wider body of opinion .
the ambiguity and sub-clauses to be found in much of the press coverage during 1980â€“1 had at least acted a a countervailing tendency against the more extreme form of discourse which blamed the riot completely on black people .
during the 1985 riot and their immediate aftermath , the imagery of â€˜ race â€™ wa used by section of the press without the sense of ambiguity which could still be found in 1980â€“1 .
the â€˜ silence over race â€™ wa breached in 1980â€“1 , but in 1985 debate about racial issue wa taken a step further .
peregrine worsthorne , for example , used the ferocity of the confrontation in handsworth , brixton , and tottenham to argue that there wa a major question mark over the possibility of assimilating the â€˜ coloured population â€™ into mainstream â€˜ british value â€™ ( sunday telegraph , 29 september 1985 ) .
to be sure there wa still a strong response opposing enoch powell 's call for repatriation , from all shade of political opinion , but the racialization of public debate about the 1985 riot went much further than 1980â€“1 .
in this context it wa the externality of british afro-caribbeans and asian which wa highlighted rather the racist institution and process which worked against black at all level of society .
the usage of â€˜ race â€™ during the september-october 1985 period took on new meaning , which had little if anything to do with the impact of racism a such , since the emphasis wa on the cultural characteristic of the minority community themselves .
after handsworth part of the press response wa to blame the riot on rivalry between west indian and asian , and even after the argument were criticized by local resident ; and community leader , they were used to â€˜ explain â€™ ' what happened .
in addition , the question whether the culture and value of the black community , their family structure , and their political attitude â€˜ bred violence â€™ wa constantly raised ( van dijk , 1988 ) .
the actual fact ' of who wa arrested during the riot , whether black or white , were hardly debated since it wa assumed that they were mostly black and mostly unemployed and involved with crime ( keith , 1987 ) .
the imagery of the â€˜ black bomber , used in handsworth wa extended to the notion that there were group of alienated and criminalized young black who saw the riot a a chance to engage in an â€˜ orgy of looting â€™ .
the dear report on handsworth capture this image and link it to the social condition of young black :
the majority of rioter who took part in these unhappy event were young , black and afro-caribbean origin .
let there be no doubt , these young criminal are not in any way representative of the vast majority of the afro-caribbean community whose life ha contributed to the life and culture of the west midland over many year and whose hope and aspiration are at one with those of every other law-abiding citizen .
we share a common sorrow .
it is the duty of u all to ensure that an entire cultural group is not tainted by the action of a criminal minority .
( dear , 1985 , p. 69 )
this â€˜ black â€™ criminal minority wa constructed not only into the leading force behind the riot , but sometimes a the only force .
indeed , throughout september and october 1985 , and during the following month , the imagery of race continued to dominate debate about both the cause and the policy outcome of the riot .
a pointed out earlier , the â€˜ social cause â€™ argument wa another major plank of public debate about the 1980â€“1 riot , particularly in relation to the highly politicized issue of unemployment .
during 1985 this issue wa raised once again , though by then the extent of mass unemployment and urban de-industrialization and decay wa more stark than it had been in 198l .
image of â€˜ urban decay â€™ , â€˜ tinderbox city â€™ , and â€˜ ghetto street â€™ linked up with the image of â€˜ race inequality â€™ and â€˜ black ghetto â€™ to produce an analysis more complex but also more contradictory .
an interesting mixture of the various image wa provided by a story in the daily telegraph under the headline : â€˜ broadwater farm : like the divis flat with reggae â€™ ( 8 october 1985 ) .
the mirror described the estate a â€˜ living hell â€™ , and quoted one resident a saying that â€˜ you 'm_ve no idea how awful daily life is â€™ ( 8 october 1985 ) .
such image were reworkings of argument already used about toxteth in 1981 and brixton in 1981 , but they were used more widely than in 1980â€“1 .
even the daily mail , which deployed the clearest use of â€˜ race â€™ and â€˜ outside agitator â€™ argument , ran a major story on broadwater farm under the headline : â€˜ burnt-out hulk litter this concrete jungle â€¦ despair hang heavy â€™ ( 8 october 1985 ) .
a number of story using such imagery were run by both the quality and the popular press during this period , but similar argument are to be found in parliamentary debate ( hansard , vol. 84 , 21 october 1985 , cols. 30-.46 , 388 ) , and even in official report produced by the police on the riot in birmingham and london .
the â€˜ city of inner despair â€™ were conceived a the breeding ground for disorderly protest , and however hard the government tried to break the causal link between the two , it wa forced to take on board the need to restore order not only through the police but through promise of help for the inner city .
much a in 1980â€“1 , the â€˜ social cause â€™ argument can not be seen separately from the broader debate about the future of the british economy and society .
the government 's record on unemployment wa a heavily politicized issue , and just a in 1981 it vehemently denied any responsibility for the riot through it pursuit of free-market policy .
but the government did find a way of accepting a link between the riot and social problem without bringing it main policy into the debate : namely by linking the growth of violent disorder to crime and drug .
the emphasis on â€˜ crime â€™ and the â€˜ criminal act â€™ of the rioter in the official response to the 1985 riot took a general and a specific form .
the general form relied on the argument that the riot were not a form of protest against the insufferable social condition of inner-city area or the action of the police , but a â€˜ criminal act â€™ or a â€˜ cry for loot â€™ .
this wa an argument put most succinctly by geoffrey dear , chief constable of the west midland ( dear , 1985 ) and by douglas hurd , the home secretary , in relation to handsworth .
but it recurred a a theme in official and press response to the other riot .
the specific form wa built upon the notion that the outbreak of violence in handsworth and brixton , in particular , wa brought about by â€˜ drug baron â€™ who saw the police attempting to curb their activity and control â€˜ their territory â€™ .
numerous example of this line of argument can be found in dear 's report on handsworth , and in press coverage during the riot .
taking the specific argument about the role of drug and â€˜ drug baron â€™ in stimulating the riot , this seems to have served two purpose .
first , it distanced the riot from the social , economic , political , and other grievance which had been linked to them by locating the cause outside the â€˜ social problem â€™ of inner-city dweller and in the â€˜ simple greed â€™ of the drug baron to accumulate â€˜ loot â€™ .
second , just a dear 's image of a few hundred â€˜ young black criminal â€™ wa used to explain what happened in handsworth , the problem of drug wa used to explain what happened at a national level .
the issue of drug provided an everyday image , already a national issue through saturation medium coverage and public debate , around which the police , the home office , and other institution could depoliticize the riot .
responding to the handsworth event douglas hurd wa moved to argue forcibly that such event were senseless and reflected more on those who participated in them than on the society in which they took place : â€˜ the sound which law abiding people in handsworth heard on monday night , the echo of which i picked up on tuesday , wa not a cry for help but a cry for loot â€™ ( financial time , 13 september 1985 ) .
the chief constable for the west midland , geoffrey dear , took this argument further by pointing out that the day before the riot a successful carnival had taken place , with the support of local community leader .
he drew the conclusion from this that the riot â€˜ came like a bolt out of the blue â€™ ( guardian , 21 november 1985 ) .
such language focused attention on the individual or group who were â€˜ breaking the law â€™ , â€˜ committing criminal act â€™ , and threatening the interest of the law-abiding â€˜ majority â€™ .
potential application
overview
ian masser
given the extent to which geographic information management is application driven , it is important to consider in some depth the characteristic of some potential application field .
in the process it will be necessary to examine not only the extent to which geographic issue feature on the policy issue agenda in these field but also the institutional context which governs decision-making and the extent to which data are available for research and policy analysis purpose .
question on data availability are likely to be particularly important where user are heavily dependent on secondary source .
in situation of this kind provision governing access and format may exert powerful constraint on the use that can be made of these data .
the first four chapter in this part examine issue relating to geographic information handling in term of four potential application field .
the author were asked to review the current state of the art in their field with particular reference to the likely requirement of the future policy issue agenda in term of the demand that they make on geographic information management .
author were also asked to evaluate critically the state of geographic information provision in term of the need of user and to consider the impact of user requirement on the development of geographic information handling methodology .
in this way the chapter in this part present a number of perspective which essentially complement and amplify the discussion in the previous part .
in this case , however , methodological issue are tackled from a largely user standpoint , whereas in the previous part they were viewed a substantive problem in their own right .
in effect the product of the discussion in both part is a matrix where the methodological issue are listed along one axis and particular application field on the other .
figure 8.1 summarizes the main feature of this matrix .
there are important difference between the chapter in this part both in the nature of the demand that they make on geographic information and also in the relative importance that is attached to geographic criterion a against other issue by planner and decision-makers in these field .
the first three chapter dealing with environmental monitoring , natural and technological hazard and settlement and infrastructure application make use of a very wide range of geographic information .
a major feature of these application is the extent to which they involve overlay of a variety of information drawn from different source on a topographic map base .
for this reason they make particularly heavy demand on current gi technology both because of the size of the data set and the diversity of the data structure that are involved .
brown 's chapter on geodemographics discus an application field where primary data collected for operational purpose are typically evaluated in relation to secondary data derived from source such a the census of population .
the range of data set involved and the demand that are made on gi technology in application of this kind are often more limited than those of previous application field .
however , this is offset by the demand that are made on spatial analysis and modelling methodology .
rhind 's chapter on environmental monitoring and prediction discus the role of geographic information management in promoting sustainable development on a global scale in the context of the issue identified in the brundtland report .
it point to the impact that the finding of global environmental research are likely to have on most sector of the uk economy .
this contribution also indicates the wide variety of group that are involved in monitoring environmental change and draw attention to the role that the european community is increasingly playing in co-ordinating these effort .
one of the example of work in progress discus research that ha been carried out for the european commission a part of the corine project .
this highlight the challenge for research in a field categorized by a lack of data for some country , varying definition and standard in use , and unreasonably high user expectation .
the chapter a a whole draw attention to a number of key methodological issue that are involved in environmental monitoring and prediction .
these include the highly specialized nature of much of the technical analysis , the limited capacity for checking the accuracy of many of the finding of this kind of research and the consequent need for the development of knowledge-based inference machine for extracting useful information from secondary and often proxy data .
in chapter 10 gatrell and vincent consider a wide range of natural and technological hazard including industrial hazard , risk assessment , hazardous waste disposal , emergency planning , natural hazard and environmental epidemiology .
the substantive content of much of this research straddle the social , environmental and mathematical science .
to model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas generated by a chemical explosion and it impact on the surrounding area , for example , an understanding of atmospheric dispersion model , epidemiology and population distribution would be required .
in application of this kind the author argue that geographic information management in general and gi in particular have an important role to play and they give a number of example from research in progress to illustrate the current state of the art in this field .
the discussion of operational problem and prospect further amplifies many of the issue raised in preceding chapter , particularly with respect to the problem caused by the dependency on secondary data source and the need for much more detailed geographic information to overcome some of the problem associated with linking data set .
like most of the other contributor to this section , gatrell and vincent see decision support system a a major area for future development in the geographic information management field .
given that â€˜ most gi are rather dumb system , requiring intelligent , very computer literate user â€™ , managing natural and technological hazard mean that this knowledge base must be built into the system so that it can be utilized quickly by untrained user after a disaster ha taken place or in an emergency .
the settlement and infrastructure field is also characterized by a wide range of user with a great diversity of interest .
these include not only central and local government but also major utility company and transport supplier .
according to shepherd these user share a common need for up-to-date information on the amount , capacity and condition of urban land , transport network , utility , hospital , school and other major communal facility .
in addition to these data requirement , such user are also interested in developing their capability for modelling the changing relationship between the supply and demand for infrastructure in the context of both public and private sector decision-making .
shepherd , more than any other contributor to this section , draw attention to the extent to which current effort in the geographic information management field are constrained by the highly fragmented nature of both data supplier and user both in sectoral and spatial term , the great diversity of data set in varying format and the difficulty presented by institutional factor such a copyright provision , data ownership and the control of access to data .
digital data occupy a central position in this application field and a number of example are given to illustrate the extent to which their development ha been hampered or facilitated in various country by the policy of the organization with responsibility for digital data provision .
in chapter 12 brown review the development of geodemographics from it origin in the computer-based social area analysis of u census tract data from 1950 onwards .
he describes the feature of the four main system that are currently in use in the uk and illustrates their application with reference to example drawn from retail analysis and store location , market research , credit rating and target marketing .
brown demonstrates the extent to which the growth of research activity in this field ha led to the emergence of improved cluster analytic method for the multidimensional classification of people according to the type of area in which they live .
in the last part of this contribution , brown identifies a number of priority for future research .
like gatrell and vincent and shepherd before him , he is concerned with the lack of detailed geographical information particularly in this case with reference to the year between census .
spatial linkage also feature prominently in brown 's discussion which amplifies many of the point made in the earlier contribution from openshaw in chapter 3 .
the analysis point to the need for the development of a fuzzy geodemographics methodology which take account of the effect of different type of spatial error .
other major research priority for the future in this application field are the development of response-modelling technique to explore the factor affecting consumer choice .
this is particularly important in a field where many of the demand made by user are highly specialized in nature .
in summary , then , a fig. 8.1 show , many of the issue raised by this review of geographic information handling in the four potential application field are essentially complementary to those discussed in the part on methodological development .
spatial analysis feature particularly prominent on the research agenda relating to natural and technological hazard and geodemographics .
question relating to data integration emerge a being particularly critical in term of environmental monitoring and settlement and infrastructure application .
spatial linkage and question relating to spatial representation feature prominently in the settlement and infrastructure and geodemographics field .
the evaluation of error propagation is a matter of considerable significance in the environmental monitoring and settlement and infrastructure field .
finally , in all application field , the finding of the review above suggest that there is a need for improvement in user interface of all kind .
this is particularly evident in the demand for the development of knowledge-based decision support system and modelling capability .
such demand highlight the extent to which geographic information management must be regarded a a mean to an end rather than an end in itself when viewed from the standpoint of the need of planner and decision-makers .
the final chapter in this section round off the discussion of applications-related research with an examination of organizational issue that need to be taken account of in handling geographic information .
campbell present a conceptual framework for the analysis of the organizational issue involved in the development and implementation of gi .
this contribution cut across many of the question relating to particular application that were raised in preceding chapter and draw attention to the danger of neglecting institutional and personal consideration in practice .
all too often , a the experience of many mature application indicates , technical and data-related matter dominate the system development phase and technically elegant solution are devised which fail to take enough account of user need and capability .
campbell discus the role of geographic information in organization and the process of gi diffusion drawing upon research from a variety of social science discipline .
the finding of the analysis are summarized in two set of research question for all application field .
in this way she set out a research agenda for applications-related research which serf a similar function to the spatial analysis research agenda set out by openshaw at the beginning of part two .
environmental monitoring and prediction
david rhind
introduction
monitoring of the state of and the change in the environment is now universally recognized a being of profound importance to mankind ( tickell 1986 , 1989 ) .
this awareness is most obviously manifested by the frequent appearance of press report on ozone depletion , on the greenhouse effect and possible global warming , on nitrate pollution , on deforestation in the tropic , on decreasing biological diversity and on many other environmentally related topic .
usually these report concentrate on prophecy of a forthcoming armageddon but many also describe a dire contemporary situation .
thus the algal bloom off the italian adriatic shore in 1989 is reckoned to have caused the holiday trade and local fisherman loss running into ten if not hundred of million of pound .
more globally , the brundtland report ( wced 1987 ) noted that , in the 900 day during which the world commission wa at work ,
1 .
the african drought put the life of 35 million people at risk and may have killed 1 million of them ;
2 .
the bhopal accident killed 2000 and injured 200 000 more ;
3 .
the chernobyl disaster caused environmental damage across europe ;
4 .
a chemical fire in switzerland caused toxic material to be transported by the rhine at least a far a the netherlands ;
5 .
at least 60 million people died of diarrhoeal disease caused by malnutrition and dirty water .
a a consequence of these and other disaster , of rapid and world-wide broadcasting of them and of the concerned action of many individual , the environment is now â€˜ moving fast up the political agenda â€™ ( patten 1989 ) .
the then prime minister also emphasized the political awakening to the environment in statement such a : â€˜ it is possible that with all these enormous change ( population , agricultural , use of fossil fuel ) concentrated into such a short period of time , we have unwittingly begun a massive experiment with the system of this planet itself â€™ ( thatcher 1988 ) .
the political concern is not altruistic .
mr thatcher , a recent convert to environmental conservation , clearly held the opinion that environmental problem are not only soluble but that solving them can be shown to be cost-effective :
in the past when we identified form of pollution , we have shown our capacity to act effectively .
the great london smog are now only a nightmare of the past .
we have cut airborne lead by 50 per cent .
we are spending â£4 billion on cleansing the mersey basin alone , and the thames now ha the cleanest metropolitan estuary in the world .
even though this kind of action may cost a lot , i believe it to be money well and necessarily spent because the health of our economy and the health of our environment are totally dependent upon each other â€¦ .
the government espouses the concept of sustainable economic development .
stable prosperity can be achieved throughout the world provided the environment is nurtured and safeguarded ( thatcher 1988 ) .
the primary official manifestation of this uk commitment to the environment ha been the government 's white paper ( hmso 1990 ) .
while criticized by many on the ground that it had few â€˜ teeth â€™ and represented a compromise between the doe and all other department ( notably those of agriculture and of transport ) , it wa none the le a major achievement .
it main section dealt with the government 's approach to the environment ( nationally , at the european level and globally ) , the nature and effect of the greenhouse effect , environmental problem in both rural and urban area ( especially in relation to land-use matter ) , pollution control and enhancing awareness of environmental matter .
central to this approach is said to be an emphasis upon guidance from the best available scientific evidence .
there is also a clear recognition of the need for monitoring and modelling of the state of the natural and man-influenced environment .
though there ha been a change of prime minister and of the secretary of state for the environment since the publication of the white paper , the environmental cause seems a strong a ever .
thus , the time of 17 december 1990 reported that a group of 40 of the most senior civil servant had met the previous weekend to discus â€˜ way in which the government machine could respond better to national and international problem such a the threat of global climate change â€™ .
pearce et al. ( 1989 ) have argued that the effect of government , commercial and other action on the environment can and should be assessed on a cost/benefit basis and this seems likely to be the basis on which at least the uk government will proceed .
given such a lead , it is scarcely surprising that british scientist have sought to demonstrate the practical and financial consequence of environmental event and process ; table 9.1 , for example illustrates their perception of the importance of global environmental research to the uk domestic economy .
if it now seems self-evident that monitoring of the global environment is necessary , indeed is even vital , the prediction of what is likely to happen is almost a important : the 170 000 people in the maldives are understandably worried about the prospect of global sea-level change since no part of the island is more than 2 m above present sea-level !
yet , a we shall see below , the prediction of the activity of natural and man-influenced environmental system requires an understanding of the interaction of process that , in many case , we simply do not yet have .
even monitoring of the present is very imperfect , a witness the order of magnitude variation in estimate now current for deforestation rate .
this chapter , then , attempt to review some of the problem in environmental monitoring and prediction , describes some of the relevant scientific and organizational activity and look ahead to what is likely to happen next .
the nature of environmental process
notwithstanding mr thatcher 's confidence that we can â€˜ fix â€™ environmental problem , the difficulty associated with a task even a apparently simple a monitoring a state variable are considerable .
some of the reason for this â€” the difficulty of deciding on appropriate proxy variable and on economical yet non-biasing temporal and spatial sampling framework , taking account of the relative importance of aperiodic and rare event a compared to near-continuous process , processing the vast volume of data usually involved and organizing the multidisciplinary and ( often ) multinational researcher involved â€” are discussed briefly later .
even at this stage , however , it is important to stress that we have a very incomplete understanding of many process in the natural environment .
the next section therefore attempt to summarize what we do know ; it is derived chiefly from the earth system science committee ( essc ) ( 1988 ) .
temporal and spatial scale of operation
even ignoring the effect of man , earth system process operate at a variety of spatial and temporal scale ( see fig. 9.1 ; see also rosswall et al. 1988 ) .
thus microclimate effect can have major short-term implication for local population ( such a those brought about by the photochemical smog of los angeles ) , are often applicable only over area of a few hectare or le and may operate on a diurnal cycle .
in contrast , soil creation ( cf. soil degradation ) may require hundred or thousand of year .
in between are variation in phenomenon such a el nino .
the sampling theorem indicates that we must sample these phenomenon at a frequency of no le than half their wavelength if we are to avoid bias in measurement .
in this chapter , the primary concern is with change occurring over time span from minute to century and from spatial wavelength from about 1 m to about 100 km .
it is , however , impossible to separate out process acting at different scale and over different period : a single volcanic eruption lasting hour or day sometimes lead to dust and gas being ejected into the atmosphere over a period of month and this in turn may lead to global climatic fluctuation over year or decade .
conversely , a large-scale and long-period phenomenon such a the movement of tectonic plate can lead to local stress accumulation and to it release by an earthquake in a few second and with highly local effect .
this therefore ha the following consequence :
1 .
we should know something about the periodicity of the variable we are monitoring if we are not to risk either unnecessarily detailed data collection or aliasing of trend ;
2 .
since we know that the periodicity of some variable is longer than the monitoring already carried out by human being , we must make use of surrogate or proxy variable to extend our range of knowledge ( such a via tree ring , palynology , oxygen isotope ratio from ice core and geomorphological evidence of environmental change ) ;
3 .
since we are not yet able to predict all the interaction which may be important in a study of environmental problem , collecting potentially useful data a well a those believed central to the problem under study is often wise ;
4 .
we must accept that most data collection exercise will inevitably be a compromise on the ground of cost and hence le than perfect data set will be produced ;
5 .
irrespective of the use of surrogate , monitoring environmental process only make sense over time-scales which are extended by human standard ( hence the igbp ( see below ) is designed to run for two or three decade ) ;
6 .
change in political priority may simply result in the need for informed guesswork if suitable data are not available .
much attention will be given throughout this chapter to monitoring the environment on a global basis .
this is not merely because of it topical nature .
the main reason is that â€” though some problem are local and are best studied that way â€” many others ( even involving a limited geographical extent ) are best understood within a global framework .
thus no meteorologist would attempt to forecast the weather 2 or 3 day ahead without using a mathematical model based on observation from all around the world .
moreover , recent work ha shown that much of the heat energy in the sea of the north atlantic ( every square kilometre of which give off a much energy a a nuclear power station and hence influence our weather ) is absorbed from sunlight in the tropical pacific and is carried by ocean current through the drake passage and up into the atlantic .
thus , to understand some local and many regional , national and continental and all global environmental event , we need to have a global perspective and hold global database ( rhind and mounsey 1989 ; mounsey and tomlinson 1988 ) .
in no way , however , doe this invalidate the need for microscale study â€” for instance , while global data set may indicate the extent of algal bloom and may suggest cause of them , only detailed study of the algae themselves can provide understanding of why the bloom is occurring .
the process themselves
a major complication , however , is that the environment can rarely be treated a in a laboratory experiment .
given this , determining the nature of the interaction between the variable becomes a matter of major difficulty .
figure 9.2 is taken from essc ( 1988 ) and is an attempt to show the interaction between environmental process , a well a the indicator and implication of change in the state of the environment .
in essence , the figure can be summarized a showing process within the physical climate system and within the biogeochemical one , these system being interwoven by the global role of water and increasingly affected by human activity .
the main component of the first system are well known : the atmosphere is it engine and atmospheric circulation is driven by difference in solar heating between the equatorial and polar region .
we are , however , becoming ever more aware of the massive influence of ocean on our climate ; research into ocean/atmosphere interaction is now a priority .
in ocean dynamic study , important topic are heat storage , circulation and the role of sea ice .
atmospheric circulation ( and , in turn , precipitation and temperature ) is also greatly affected by the balance of thermal energy at the land surface , itself affected by the vegetation and terrain characteristic .
the biogeochemical system embrace the totality of the movement of the key element essential to life â€” carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , phosphorus and others â€” through what ha been described a the total earth system .
the ocean and their biota play a central role in the carbon and nutrient cycle ; global ocean circulation is also critical to the global carbon budget .
trace gas in the atmosphere are key component of the cycle of such element a carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , sulphur and the halogen ; a is now well known , their concentration are much influenced by biogenic and anthropogenic activity and the concentration of such gas a carbon dioxide , ozone , methane , nitrous oxide and the chlorofluoromethanes ( cfms ) strongly affect radiative transfer and provide a link with the physical climate system .
a particular cause for concern is that the concentration of the two main cfms is increasing by about 5 per cent per annum while the equivalent figure for methane , nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are 1 , 0.4 and 0.3 per cent .
finally , the chemistry of the stratosphere is dominated by the photochemical production and catalytic destruction of ozone .
there are several important way in which biogeochemical process can influence climate and hence habitability ( except where the latter is maintained at enormous cost ) .
if , for instance , the concentration of certain trace gas ( see above ) continue to increase , it ha been predicted that the earth 's surface temperature will increase by an amount comparable to that since the last major phase of the most recent glaciation ( about 18 000 year bp ) â€” though there is some dispute about the magnitude of the likely change .
the converse case â€” the effect of physical climate change on biogeochemical process â€” is also of obvious importance : change in annual average and cycle of temperature and precipitation , together with the probability of extreme event such a prolonged drought or frost , are major determinant of terrestrial ecosystem type , at least in area largely unaffected by human activity .
human-induced change to the environment have increased rapidly a a consequence of growing population number and of numerous development in technology .
fossil fuel combustion , for instance , ha led to increased concentration of sulphate in precipitation ( â€™ acid rain' ) and many river , lake and estuary have been greatly affected by phosphate from agricultural , urban or industrial source .
it should be stressed , however , that â€” while the outline of human activity are clear â€” there are still many uncertainty : for instance , we know that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide ha risen about 9 per cent since 1959 .
but calculation of the total carbon released by fossil fuel combustion imply that , if all such carbon remained in the atmosphere , the concentration would have increased by twice a much .
the absolute difference between the two figure seems to be due to two different factor : absorption by the ocean and other reduction in carbon stock in living biota , the latter being strongly affected by human activity since the industrial revolution .
doe god play dice ?
much environmental prediction is predicated upon a logical positivist or newtonian deterministic basis .
the environmental system are effectively regarded a machine whose working can all be discovered , described in differential equation form and whose future activity can thus be predicted in detail if their initial state are known .
an argument by many atmospheric physicist , for example , is that shortcoming in the accuracy of weather prediction over period of more than a few day largely result from the unsophisticated nature of existing model , the lack of suitable data and inadequate computer power ( see fig. 9.3 , derived from tyler 1989 ) .
in contrast , the advocate of chaos theory ( e.g. stewart 1989 ) argue that some natural system are so sensitive to tiny stimulus that even â€˜ the faint beat of a butterfly 's wing could be the ultimate trigger for a hurricane â€™ .
in essence , they argue that tiny difference in the initial condition of many system can lead to widely different outcome since the system exhibit stochastic behaviour within a deterministic framework .
if so , there is little chance of making accurate long-term forecast of these system .
this ha been recognized by , among others , essc ( 1988 ) .
the author of that report accepted that there is a theoretical limit of 2â€“3 week in explicit prediction of day-to-day fluctuation in weather because of the influence of small-scale turbulence within the large-scale dynamic ; such limit imply that medium and long-term prediction must inevitably be stochastic .
to complicate matter still further , however , it seems at least possible that the component of the earth system may best be predicted deterministically at some spatial and temporal scale but stochastically at others and that the basis of prediction will differ for different component .
a an example , atmospheric temperature show marked day-to-day variability , a strong seasonal cycle with some year-to-year variation , a weak minimum variability for 10â€“20 year average and then increased variation again at longer time-scales ( essc 1988 ) .
it need hardly be pointed out that coping with such multiple database on which modelling is to be carried out is not a trivial exercise .
finally , it is perhaps worth concluding this section by emphasizing that there is still much controversy among the scientific community about the magnitude of many of the effect being discussed .
in general , the research work of the international group of scientist , including those involved in the inter-governmental committee and in the uk 's inter-agency committee on global environmental change , ha progressively reduced the magnitude of the predicted effect of , for example , global warming .
in giving the 1990 robens coal science lecture at the royal institution , sir john mason ( a former director of the meteorological office ) urged caution in interpreting the result of the massive atmospheric and oceanic modelling exercise ; a the equilibrium model are refined to take account of the thermal lag in ocean , etc. , lower value of predicted change are likely .
thus , while almost all scientist are â€” at the time of writing â€” convinced from the evidence that change in climate is under way and that regional effect may be much greater than the global average , the magnitude of the latter is now thought likely to be about half of what wa predicted only 5 year ago .
who is involved and what is going on ?
if we consider the environment in the broadest sense , much monitoring of it ha been in progress for many year and by an enormous diversity of organization in the uk ; these include the doe , the forestry commission , the nature conservancy , the health and safety executive , local authority , the component member of the natural environment research council ( such a the institute of terrestrial ecology and the british antarctic survey ) , individual or research group in academia , the cegb , the friend of the earth , and uk centre for economic and environmental development ( ceed ) ( 1989 ) .
the diversity of monitoring organization seems just a great in other country ; numerous multinational organization , both quasi-governmental ( e.g. the un environment programme ( unep ) ) and non-governmental ( e.g. the international union for the conservation of nature ( iucn ) and the international institute for environment and development ( iied ) ) are also active in the field .
moreover , commercial monitoring of the environment is now also routine , notably to predict crop yield in the main grain-growing area and hence facilitate the buying of future .
the international scientific involvement
scientist have both promoted and responded to the increasing interest in the environment .
thus , at the global scale , the international council of scientific union ( icsu ) ha endorsed the setting up of the international geosphere biosphere project ( igbp ) to â€˜ describe and understand the interactive physical , chemical and biological process that regulate the total earth system , the unique environment it provides for life , the change that are occurring in that system and the manner by which these change are influenced by human action â€™ ( report of ad hoc planning group for igbp 1986 , quoted in igbp 1988 ) .
priority in the igbp is intended to be given to those area which deal with key interaction and significant change on the time-scales of decade to century , that most affect the biosphere , that are most susceptible to human perturbation and those that will most likely lead to a practical , predictive capability for global change .
this is to be put into operation by concentrating on four theme :
1 .
documenting and predicting global change ;
2 .
observing and improving our understanding of dominant forcing function ;
3 .
improving our understanding of interactive phenomenon in the total earth system ;
4 .
assessing those effect of global change which will be large scale and cause major modification to both renewable and non-renewable resource .
by 1990 , igbp had progressed a far a defining a set of seven core project ( igbp 1990 ) addressing these four theme .
in addition , plan for regional research centre and for the data and information system for igbp ( known a igbp-dis ) had been announced .
the latter are particularly relevant to this chapter .
based in paris and working under professor i. rasool , it is intended to concentrate on managerial and policy aspect of the task in the first 2 year ( 1990â€“92 ) but then to expand considerably thereafter .
task agreed for the igbp-dis include making available a â€˜ directory of data directory â€™ modelled on nasa 's master directory , providing data set for education and training and undertaking a land cover pilot study .
until 1990 , remarkably little interaction had taken place between the â€˜ hard science â€™ and the social science community on global monitoring and prediction .
it is noteworthy , however , that the royal society made a plea for just this type of multidisciplinary work in it submission on greenhouse gas to the house of lord ' select committee on science and technology ( royal society 1989 : 40 ) .
fortunately , in addition to the action of the world â€˜ hard science â€™ community , a parallel effort is now being initiated by social scientist ( fuchs 1989 ; jacobson and price 1990 ) .
currently this is organized and sponsored by the international social science council ( issc ) , the un university and the international federation of institute of advanced study .
it objective are to :
1 .
improve scientific understanding and increase awareness of the complex dynamic governing human interaction with the total earth system ;
2 .
study , explore and anticipate social change affecting the global environment ;
3 .
identify broad social strategy to prevent or mitigate undesirable impact of global change or to adapt to change which are unavoidable ;
4 .
analyse policy option for dealing with global environmental change and promoting the goal of sustainable development .
jacobson and price ( 1990 ) provide a useful summary of the way in which human factor contribute to , and are affected by , likely global change ; in particular , they stress the importance of the data-handling issue and the role of gi in coping with some of the problem of data integration and manipulation .
the issc proposed it own work programme in the human dimension of global change in late 1990 .
while these organization intrinsically have a world-wide membership and are concerned with research into global environmental change , others share the same interest but from a more restricted geographical base .
a leading example of this is the european science foundation which ha sponsored research programme in both the physical and social science aspect of environmental change ( esf 1990 ) .
governmental and political involvement
the spread of environmental awareness is readily demonstrated : in 1972 , 26 country had environmental and natural resource management agency whereas , a decade later the number wa 144 ( wec 1985 ) .
in most country , the governmental and political concern with the environment ha come somewhat later than that of scientist or concerned lay people : the early development of the green party in the federal republic of germany is something of an exception .
such a commitment to the environment is , none the le , both welcome and necessary if resource are to be made available to tackle existing , let alone forthcoming , environmental problem .
the â€˜ conversion â€™ of the uk government ha been briefly described earlier ; it is manifested in their july 1989 commitment to spend â£10m. on climate change research in 1989/90 and the confident request to them from the advisory board for the research council ( abrc ) for an extra â£11m. in 1990 and â£13m. in the two succeeding year for additional environmental research .
perhaps the most significant development of all , however , is the increasing role of the european commission .
their role in bringing environmental impact assessment ( eia ) on to the statute book is well known , but the commission ha now made a proposal ( cec 1989 ) for the â€˜ establishment of the european environment agency and the european environment monitoring and information network â€™ .
the commission argues that there is at present no monitoring of environmental quality and trend on a european scale , nor any guarantee that the result of environmental monitoring will be comparable on a community-wide basis ( a realization brought about through the corine programme described later ) .
the objective of the new agency would be to assist the community and the member state to achieve the goal set out in the treaty of rome and in successive environmental action programme ; it must also , however , be seen in the context of the european council 's adoption on 2 december 1988 of the rhodes declaration on the environment and the environment chapter in the single european act which come into effect in 1992 .
the detailed specific role of â€˜ the system â€™ ( comprising both agency and network ) are envisaged a :
1 .
to provide the community , the member state and participating third country with the objective ( sic ) information requested for the formulation and implementation of sound and effective environmental policy ;
2 .
in particular , to provide technical , scientific and economic information requested by the commission in it task of identification , preparation and assessment of the implementation and result of environmental action and legislation ;
3 .
to stimulate the development and the application within the agency of technique of environmental modelling and forecasting in order that adequate preventative action can be taken at the appropriate time ;
4 .
to help ensure the harmonization and comparability of environmental data in the community a well a the integration of european environmental data into international environmental monitoring programme , such a those established within the framework of the united nation and it system of agency .
considerable stress is laid by the commission on collaboration with national data-gathering agency and with state adjacent to the community 's border .
it is envisaged that the totality of activity will extend the existing state of the european environment report ( cec 1988 ) through addressing the issue of the quality and sensitivity of the environment and also the pressure upon it .
priority for the new agency include study of atmospheric emission and quality , water resource and quality ( including the marine environment ) , soil erosion and pollution and important land resource , and biotopes and nature conservation .
at the time of writing , the proposal ha been approved and discussion are in progress on the location of the agency 's headquarters .
it seems certain to have major and growing effect upon environmental monitoring and prediction in europe and on the policy of component government .
yet this is by no mean the only plan which the community ha in relation to the environment : directorate-general xii ( that for science , research and development ) ha published detail of an extensive r&d programme ( cec 1990a ) and the commission a a whole ( cec 1990b ) ha made public it plan to develop regular official statistic of the environment .
the private sector
certain aspect of environmental monitoring have long been carried out by the private sector , notably that of crop state on a world-wide basis .
derived from satellite imagery at comparatively low resolution , predicted yield for different crop in different nation state become of commercial value .
however , significant resource are also being made available by the private sector where there is no immediate commercial gain : thus ibm uk ltd ha donated â£3.5m. of computing equipment to unep and ibm in general is actively supporting other r&d which can be expected to facilitate â€˜ sustainable development â€™ : ibm europe , for instance , ha invested $16m. in it bergen scientific centre to make it the focal point for the company 's environmental modelling and a centre for information on the environment and sustainable development .
on a more modest basis , ibm uk have agreed to fund a pilot global population database being built in birkbeck college to permit assessment of the impact of environmental change on the world s population .
many other company , of course , are supporting environmental work but ibm seems almost to be unique in it corporate commitment to use of high technology for facilitating â€˜ sustainable development â€™ .
some example of environmental monitoring project
the local scale
at the local scale , it is usually impossible to neglect the effect of multiple process operating .
an example of environmental modelling and prediction where the interaction between different process and dynamic feedback is taken into account is given by haber and schaller ( 1988 ) .
their work formed part of one unesco man and biosphere ( mab ) project , carried out in the berchtesgaden national park in bavaria .
following holling ( 1978 ) and grossman ( 1983 ) , they conceptualized the man/environment relationship at a series of hierarchical level :
1 .
the lowest , or process , level , is directly and ( usually ) obviously connected to perceived reality .
thus process and interrelationship are mostly obvious , simple and linear ; data are usually readily available and may be voluminous .
this level is readily handled in commercial gi ; ,
2 .
the intermediate , or dynamic , level is concerned with le frequent and often irregular event , e.g. a temporary lack of water because of fire , frost or excessive demand from an increasing populace .
characteristically , the data used may be more difficult to obtain and are usually more spatially aggregated ; modelling software which permit feedback loop is essential ;
3 .
the top , or strategic , level is the most difficult to explore ; the external influence are often unpredictable by formal mean .
relevant data are therefore difficult to identify and scenario building is one of the few approach available .
the haber and schaller approach is to â€˜ soft-couple â€™ these different level and their accompanying approach using an ecological balance model .
result of running this with different scenario include â€˜ time slice â€™ map of possible outcome and of the exchange of material and energy within the study area .
while ultimately qualitative , it seems to offer a method for coping with different type of process and incorporating stochastic and truly random event .
the national and continental scale : the corine project
the corine programme represents the product of much activity by the european commission 's directorate-general ( xi ) for the environment .
it originates from an italian request to the council of minister in 1973 to identify environmentally â€˜ balanced â€™ and â€˜ unbalanced â€™ area in the community ; the first attempt to do this were unsuccessful and , though by 1981 it wa clear that a new approach based on an environmental information system wa the most promising one , funding for this wa not secured until 1985 .
a 4-year experimental programme to â€˜ collect , co-ordinate and ensure the consistency of information on the state of the environment and natural resource in the european community â€™ wa set up and labelled corine .
the objective of corine were to be achieved through bringing together existing data holding in the member state , developing method for holding , analysing and presenting the data , and encouraging the exchange of data .
a number of priority area were identified , including biotopes of importance for nature conservation , acid deposition and it effect on soil and biotopes and the protection of the environment of the mediterranean region ( briggs and martin 1988 ) .
many achievement can be claimed by the corine project team .
a a result of some 40 sub-projects involving all the member state ( and often several group within each one ) , database of topography , soil , water resource and quality , biotopes , atmospheric emission , climate , soil erosion and administrative boundary have been built up for the whole community and can be interrelated ; other data set ( such a land cover , derived from satellite imagery ) have already been compiled for some of the member state .
various aspect of the corine project have been described in paper by rhind et al. ( 1986 ) , wiggins et al. ( 1987 ) , briggs and martin ( 1988 ) , briggs and mounsey ( 1989 ) and cec ( 1990c ) .
for the present purpose , however , the key finding are :
1 .
many necessary data set were unavailable for reason of administrative inadequacy , confidentiality constraint , cost or non-collection in certain country ;
2 .
the unavoidable reliance upon existing data set led to many problem due to non-harmonization even of commonly used variable , e.g. eight different definition of potential evapo-transpiration were in use in the member state and â€˜ maximum temperature â€™ at each weather station wa defined in at least four different way ;
3 .
the compilation of a spatially coherent database from mapped information compiled by different organization at different scale and on different topographic base ( see rhind and clark 1988 ) is often difficult ;
4 .
user expectation are often unreasonably high ; use of administrative computing system encourages bureaucrat to believe that environmental data can just a readily be analysed and used to support decision .
the â€˜ fuzzy â€™ nature of much geographically distributed data , the inherent error in it , the effect of the processing algorithm used and the assumption of known interaction between variable ensures that completely routine use by unskilled user is unlikely to be possible in the foreseeable future ;
5 .
more detailed data are required for particular task a the role of corine grows .
the european commission 's proposal for an environment agency ( see above ) will subsume the corine team and database .
the global scale : nasa and gems/grid
without question , the largest â€˜ player â€™ in the global environment arena is nasa .
the organization ha initiated many of the scheme which now are under discussion â€” the igbp , for instance , ha been strongly influenced by nasa proposal .
a summary of current activity and future plan is given in nasa ( 1988b ) .
by way of example , current programme are collecting global data on stratospheric ozone , on sea-surface and sea-ice variable and on the earth 's radiation budget .
approved future programme include the upper atmosphere research satellite , the nasa scatterometer and the joint nasa/cnes ocean topography experiment .
in addition , however , funding ha recently been approved for a much more ambitious scheme â€” the earth observing system ( eos ) .
this is conceived not a a set of hardware but a a comprehensive information system focused on the need identified by the essc ( see above ) and anticipating somewhat those of igbp .
it will collate data from the two proposed space station polar platform , one european space agency platform , a japanese one and also from the manned space station .
on this basis , a data flow of no le than 1 terabyte ( i.e. 10&sup12 ; byte ) day is anticipated by the mid-1990s .
a major user of nasa data and skill ha been the un environment programme .
formed in the wake of the 1972 stockholm conference , unep soon spawned the global environment monitoring system ( gem ) a well a an international register of potentially toxic chemical and a global network of source to locate and provide technical , scientific and management information on the environment .
the need for a mechanism to handle the global environmental data wa defined in the early 1980s and the global resource information database ( grid ) resulted .
mooneyhan ( 1988 ) ha described the progress of the pilot stage of grid which culminated in approval for a full operational phase ; grid is now involved in integrating , storing and exploiting a variety of global environmental database , mostly acquired from nasa .
in addition to the work being carried out in the unep hq at nairobi and in the gems/grid site in geneva , a series of grid regional node are now being set up world-wide , each equipped with the same hardware and software and local subset of the data .
the first of these is in bangkok and another is to be opened in latin america .
moreover , national node are also being set up ; the recent ibm gift to grid ( see above ) ha ensured that powerful microcomputer have been installed in many african country , together with national and continental data set .
training of unskilled staff to operate this equipment and to exploit the scientific data is now a major role for grid staff .
technical aspect and problem
it follows from much of the above that there are major challenge in use of environmental data .
these are best considered by itemizing characteristic of contemporary environmental monitoring and prediction :
1 .
the use of secondary data , rather than primary data collected by the data analyst ;
2 .
the need , at least with data on the terrestrial environment , for an inference process to extract useful information from the secondary ( and often proxy ) data ;
3 .
the data volume collected are often voluminous even by the standard of contemporary computing facility ;
4 .
the analysis carried out are often arcane in detail to all but a small group of â€˜ high priest â€™ ;
5 .
we have only a limited capacity for checking the accuracy of many environmental monitoring result , let alone of prediction .
some of these characteristic are now addressed in slightly more detail ; it will be obvious that such problem merit a paper in themselves .
remote sensing a a data collection process
a the need for more extensive , high-resolution yet consistent and up-to-date data becomes more pressing , increased use of remote sensing seems inevitable .
no other data collection methodology obviates the short distance variation in data set induced by variation in data collection and aggregation methodology typically encountered between adjacent nation state .
the problem is now recognized , especially in europe , and strenuous effort are being made to harmonise the data set ( e.g. through the use of standard classification , such a that for land use produced by the conference of european statistician in 1989 ) .
at present , however , ground-collected environmental data are far le than ideal .
recognizing this , nasa ( 1988a ) concluded that forthcoming global science project would need land surface altitude data at three resolution : 1 km resolution in xy and 10â€“100 m resolution in z on a global basis , 100 m xy resolution and 1â€“10 m resolution in z for regional database and 10 m xy resolution and 0.1â€“1 m in z for local study .
they argued that existing map and digitized file from them are unable to meet these need at global or regional scale and only remote sensing could help in the short term : the availability of stereometric data from the french spot satellite ha already led to proposal for automated creation of global digital elevation model with a spatial ( xy ) resolution of about 30 m ( muller 1989 ) .
for many terrestrial purpose , however , a substantial inference process must take place to convert the radiometric measurement into useful information ( in contrast , more direct measurement of sea state , etc. are possible ) .
the value of this information is inherently dependent upon the quality of the inference process and that in turn depends upon the complexity of the scene , the spatial , temporal and spectral resolution of the sensor and the particular algorithm used .
thus far , for instance , accuracy of land cover ( let alone what is often needed , i.e. land use ) determined from landsat and spot imagery for the uk have rarely been higher than 70 per cent unless trivial classification ( e.g. built/unbuilt land ) have been used .
one solution to this is to â€˜ densify â€™ the ground control and another is to use contextually based classifier rather than the traditional , spectrally based one .
but the ground condition in some part of europe make good result extremely difficult to obtain : some area of portugal , for instance , have field size of only a few metre and exhibit multi-level and multi-seasonal cropping .
a further difficulty is the cost of the data in relation to it anticipated benefit .
relatively few cost/benefit study have yet been carried out except in such area a crop prediction and ocean navigation ( where they are generally shown to be highly advantageous in saving someone else 's money ) .
it may be that a study commissioned from contractor by the british national space centre will provide useful evidence on the cash value of remote sensing ; it is particularly timely in view of the appointment of professor pearce ( see above ) a the adviser to the uk secretary of state for the environment .
other work on assessment of cost and benefit of such data have been carried out for the french government by professor didier ( 1990 ) .
finally , since data are often costly to acquire , it follows that summary of them e.g. the state of the european environment report ( cec 1988 ) and the environmental data report of the un ep ( gem marc 1989 ) are of considerable value .
equally , the â€˜ signposting â€™ role now being adopted by unep 's grid project â€” which is expected to offer on-line access to a catalogue of environmental data set and detail of the responsible agency in 1991 â€” is to be welcomed .
the data problem and partial solution
the lack of harmonization of definition and method of collection of environmental data have already been outlined above .
in the european community of 12 nation state , for instance , no le than eight procedure for calculating potential evapo-transpiration have been in use !
the need for harmonization is obvious and , in this respect , must follow from the successful pioneering achievement of eurostat in harmonizing the definition in trade , demographic and other â€˜ social science â€™ statistic ( see cec 1990b ) .
an additional and severe problem is that the volume of data which are already collected are huge by the standard of only a decade ago .
by 1995/96 , they will be very much greater , notably from the eos programme .
nasa ha announced plan to collect up to 1 terabyte ( 10&sup12 ; byte ) day .
since remote sensing data set ( especially those pertaining to terrestrial area of the globe ) typically need much pre-processing to calibrate , transform and then perform an inference process and hence convert measurement of the radiation reflected or emitted by small area of ground into useful ( e.g. land cover ) data , the processing power required is going to be formidable .
other , non-remote-sensing data set are smaller in volume but more complex in structure and in their characteristic .
to hold all of the 1/50 000 scale topographic map coverage alone for the european community would probably require about 3 terabyte of storage .
parenthetically , the form in which the data may be held can affect dramatically the scale of the problem faced .
it would be technically possible , for instance , to hold in le than 1 terabyte detailed information for every individual in the world , akin to that collected about everyone in the uk through the census of population .
in practice , legislation generally forbids such data being held thus and distributed in anything other than area aggregate form ; the cross-tabulations commonly employed ( e.g. to give table of population number broken down by age and sex ) often result in a great multiplication of the data volume .
this all present major problem of data storage , handling ( especially for global data set ) , display and dissemination .
fortunately , technical development have ensured that the increase in computing power per unit cost ha been growing at about an order of magnitude every 6 year over the last three decade .
indeed , this may grossly under-represent the present situation : the rapid spread of unix-based system seems to facilitate competition and , at the time of writing , performance of workstation per unit cost seems to be increasing at about 50 per cent per annum .
moreover , the advent of low-cost , high-density-storage device like cd-rom may well make substantial data set available even to those with modest computing power : a cd-rom , for instance , can hold about 600 megabyte ( i.e. 10&sup6 ; byte ) , can be reproduced currently for about â£1 and read on a device costing about â£400 .
yet , despite such revolutionary change in technology , novel solution will still be required to make effective use of the new data set .
one such solution is goodchild and yang 's ( 1989 ) scheme for a hierarchical spatial data structure to handle data for the spherical earth .
a particular problem is that little or no quantitative regard ha been paid until recently to the effect of quality variation in environmental data .
the literature of the last few year is thronged with paper proposing that these must be taken into account â€” but with few realistic proposal on how this is to be achieved .
goodchild ( 1988 ) ha made perhaps the best summary of the problem and possible solution to date .
finally , relatively little emphasis ha been given to the management of data a a corporate resource , available to a wide community : many environmental data are collected on a project-by-project basis and â€˜ lost â€™ once the urgency of the initial research is over .
however , the 1990 report of the data and facility working group of the uk inter-agency committee on global environmental change argued strongly that planning for the dissemination and maintenance of such data wa a vital role .
it also noted that ownership of and access to environmental data wa a policy matter of the greatest importance ; this may be more difficult in â€˜ within country â€™ data than with global data since the latter are often already the subject of international exchange agreement at zero cost .
global environmental research and the social science
thus far , the emphasis ha been very much on the natural science aspect of environmental monitoring and prediction .
that is unremarkable since the anticipation of such problem and assessment of some of their cause and magnitude can only be made by environmental scientist .
yet the consequence of any significant change are a matter of the utmost concern to planner and to politician at all level , the quantification of the cost and benefit of alternative policy strategy is very much a matter for economist , and the adaptation of society to massive change is a particular interest to sociologist and others .
for geographer â€” who span the conventional ( and now archaic ) dichotomy between the natural and the environmental science â€” all of these aspect need to be woven together to anticipate the likely spatial pattern of the effect of massive change , the redistribution in trade , health and wealth which they will bring about and the â€˜ knock on â€™ effect these consequence themselves will have on society and the environment .
for social scientist , then , environmental monitoring and prediction are a matter of considerable significance , especially a â€˜ globalization â€™ of market and economy proceeds .
the economic and social research council ( esrc ) commissioned two report on global environmental change to guide or at least inform the allocation of research funding .
these report ( pearce 1990 ; turner 1990 ) may be taken a informed view from at least the economist in the uk social science community on the social science aspect of global environmental change .
pearce ( 1990 ) , for instance , presented an economist 's view of the high-priority topic for research a follows :
1 .
the theory and practice of international agreement , viewed in a game theory context ;
2 .
the theory of optimal behaviour under scientific uncertainty ; ,
3 .
cost-benefit framework , especially for dealing with man-induced climatic effect ;
4 .
definition of the impact of climate change on eastern europe and the developing country ;
5 .
appropriate policy on non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas ;
6 .
assessment of the ecological value of tropical forest ;
7 .
economic instrument for reducing greenhouse gas ;
8 .
the international politics of climate change ;
9 .
national and global energy option given the greenhouse effect ;
10 .
trade and global change .
turner ( 1990 ) argued that the priority are a follows :
1 .
the socio-economic consequence of sea-level rise ;
2 .
technique for the valuation of environmental resource and effect ;
3 .
an assessment of management tool , institutional adaptation and policy integration in regard to global environmental change ;
4 .
study of agriculture in relation to climate change ;
5 .
understanding of how environmental issue and technical change interact ;
6 .
the interrelationship between environmental ethic and economics .
there is , then , no shortage of social science research which is claimed to be necessary if we are to cope with environmental change .
some of it is being carried out : in march 1991 esrc announced a â£6m programme of research on global environmental change .
however , perhaps most critical of all in the early stage is social science practice rather than research .
in the usa at least , there need to be an improvement in scientist ' understanding of how to influence the allocation of funding for remedial measure or for further research ( see kitsos and ashe 1989 ) .
all too often , it seems that the coupling of an a yet imperfect scientific understanding to policy-making is tenuous ( see table 9.2 ) .
fortunately , considerable high-quality work ha already begun on the legal , political and institutional aspect of global environmental change ( see , for instance , nitze 1990 ) .
what next ?
the content of this chapter have scarcely touched upon such important environmental research a the world ocean climate experiment or the world climate research programme .
nor ha there been any discussion of the growing requirement in the uk ( a elsewhere ) to carry out an environmental impact assessment for all major development .
the consequence for some nation or subgroup in a population of being without access to environmental data or the tool for analysing them while others have such access are potentially profound â€” a the european commission ha recognized in issuing a directive on public access to environmental data ( cec 1990d ) â€” yet space limitation have also precluded their discussion .
despite these shortcoming dictated by the space available , what ha been said should be sufficient to illustrate the enormous and diverse scope of environmental monitoring and prediction .
such is it diversity that measuring the total expenditure on it seems quite impossible and the number of â€˜ actor â€™ already involved is vast .
what is clear , however , is that monitoring is rarely a simple exercise , that the time-scales of the sponsor of monitoring and environmental research are rarely long term though most science is inevitably of this nature and that the increasingly multinational nature of such work necessitates a degree of management not always present in local or nationally based scheme .
in these circumstance , it is scarcely surprising that there is evidence of international and interdisciplinary dispute , a terney ( 1989 ) ha chronicled in regard to igbp .
moreover , a newby ( 1990 ) ha pointed out , the complexity of environmental research have created a new kind of relationship between research and policy : â€˜ in the past , â€¦ the relationship wa predicated on the belief that science provided decision-makers with objective â€˜ hard â€™ fact on which to base their soft , value-ridden policy â€¦ .
but now we find scientist delivering only â€˜ soft â€™ , uncertain â€˜ fact â€™ to decision-makers facing â€˜ hard â€™ decision . â€™
yet , even if all of this cause great uncertainty among scientist , it is still a reasonable prediction that a decade ahead will see both environmental monitoring and prediction treated a an everyday need and activity in major organization .
we shall also see the existence of binding requirement upon national government â€” certainly in the european community â€” to collect at least basic environmental indicator in a harmonized form ( cec 1990b ) .
more than that , it seems highly likely that the social science aspect of environmental problem will underpin the action of government and international agency .
perhaps the single most important conclusion to be drawn from this review is that the monitoring , modelling and management of the global environment are task which uniquely require the integration of skill and technique from many discipline .
building such research team is essential .
underlying it all , however , is one obvious fact : that the gathering and analysis of geographically distributed environmental data form the necessary starting-point for ensuring the success of our future on earth .

managing natural and technological hazard
anthony c. gatrell and peter vincent
introduction
few area of the application of gi technology can be a socially significant , or environmentally relevant , a the management of emergency and disaster due to natural and technological hazard .
whether attempting to construct a database of resource for use in planning response to nuclear emergency , developing optimal route for scheduling the safe transport of hazardous substance , or monitoring the health implication of a disaster , gi can assist in identifying possibility and formulating solution .
the 1990s have been declared the international decade for natural disaster reduction .
let u hope that g1s can , in some small way , help mitigate the suffering and hardship felt by all those afflicted by the effect of hazard which , a we have learnt with bitter recent experience in the uk , can occur in an untimely fashion in the most improbable of place .
research on hazard is multidisciplinary and straddle the social , environmental and mathematical science .
if , for instance , we wish to model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas resulting from a chemical explosion , ass it possible impact on human health and evaluate likely evacuation scenario of the population at risk we would require , for example , a knowledge of atmospheric dispersion model , epidemiology and population distribution .
some researcher suggest that hazard ( and emergency that might result ) can be regarded a either natural or technological .
we shall elaborate on this simple division below but suggest here that the wealth of literature on the former ( see , for instance , burton et al. 1978 and perry 1981 ) ha yet to be matched by a similar volume of work on the latter .
there are sign that this imbalance is being rectified ( zeigler et al. 1983 ) .
hazard research , like few other gi application area , is not only stretching the present technology to it limit but is a quite remarkable focus of international effort into several important research-related area such a expert system and simulation study .
in this sense the scene is clearly one of hazard problem looking for improved gi rather than for gi looking for good problem , a is all too often the case .
hazard research
what are hazard ?
formally , a hazard can be defined a : â€˜ a physical situation with a potential for human injury , damage to property , damage to the environment , or some combination of these â€™ ( health and safety executive 1989 : 30 ) .
a hazard is a threat which , given a set of circumstance , may become translated into a realized event .
what we choose to call this event depends upon factor such a it magnitude : we speak for instance of accident , emergency , disaster and catastrophe , each of which carry connotation concerning the scale of the event and each of which will have a set of human and/or environmental consequence .
on 30 march 1956 one of the most powerful volcanic disturbance this century , the bezymianny eruption , occurred .
few people noticed the event a it took place in an uninhabited part of kamchatcka and caused no known casualty .
in contrast , the extrusion of a small volume of lava from a secondary cone on the slope of tristan da cunha became the focus of global interest when , during october 1961 , the island 's lobster processing plant wa smothered and the 300 people of the island 's only settlement were evacuated to the uk .
these two contrasting event emphasize the central fact that even natural hazard are not defined solely by the characteristic of the event but by the interaction of those event with the human occupation of the threatened area .
a noted above , the simple division of hazard is between those which are natural and those which are technological or human-induced .
each of these may be further subdivided and the typology shown in fig. 10.1 draw upon the classic work of burton and kates ( 1964 ) in separating geophysical from biological hazard and zeigler et al. ( 1983 ) in distinguishing public ( or what we might call societal ) hazard from private ( individual ) one .
the further subdivision of natural hazard is self-explanatory a is that of individual technological hazard .
zeigler divide the public hazard into those which result from the production of raw material and manufactured good , those which originate in transport and transmission and those which threaten the public in their role a consumer .
the united nation disaster relief organization ( undro ) ha produced a classification of disaster , derived on the basis of case data ( table 10.1 ) .
undro recognizes three basic type of disaster : accident , natural event , and other disaster .
the differentiation of accident from other type is useful in the context of emergency planning and is not so clearly conveyed by other hazard typology .
however , the temptation in all classification exercise is to produce partitional scheme and this should really be resisted here .
it is more useful ( johnson 1983 ) to adopt a non-partitional scheme ( fig. 10.1 ) that recognizes , for instance , food poisoning a both a personal and consumer hazard , or lead pollution ( e.g. from car exhaust ) a both a meteorological event and technological hazard ( both public and private ) .
an air crash ( a at lockerbie ) affect an entire community directly , a well a being an occupational hazard and risk to the individual traveller .
hillslope failure ( a at aberfan in south wale in 1966 ) is a geomorphic hazard but may arise because of raw material extraction .
dutch elm disease is a floral hazard but is exacerbated by the transport of infected log .
hohensemer et al. ( 1983 ) make the important point that hazard are multidimensional in nature and suggest 12 dimension along which any hazard may be scored ( see table 10.2 ) .
these factor will , of course , be important in deciding on the role that gi can play in hazard monitoring and emergency planning .
for instance , some event will persist briefly , have immediate consequence , minor transgenerational effect and have little or no potential for non-human mortality ( an air crash is an example ) .
others , such a a chemical explosion involving the release of a toxic gas , may persist for a week or more , have delayed consequence , may affect a future generation if the toxic chemical is mutagenic and may have a significant impact on plant and animal population .
there may be more scope for a gi approach in the latter than in the former situation .
the hohensemer scheme is not , however , beyond criticism .
for example , can hazard really be thought of a having any intentionality ?
industrial hazard and risk assessment
once hazard have been identified there may follow effort to ass the hazard risk .
by â€˜ risk â€™ we understand â€˜ the likelihood of a specified undesired event occurring within a specified period or in specified circumstance â€™ ( health and safety executive 1989 : 30 ) .
it may , of course , be easier to quantify risk for natural hazard because of historical record and statistical estimation of recurrence interval .
technological hazard are more unpredictable and may be extremely rare , so that it becomes difficult to use probability concept to quantify risk , especially those which rely on notion of relative frequency .
the identification of chemical hazard requires that the location of site be known , together with the dangerous substance stored or processed there .
in the uk ( see petts 1988 for a splendid overview ) the health and safety executive must be notified of site where hazardous substance in excess of threshold limit are handled .
such substance and threshold include , for instance , 25 tonne of flammable liquid petroleum gas and the explosive sodium chlorate , and 10 tonne of toxic chlorine gas .
some 1600 installation are notifiable , along with thousand of kilometre of pipeline ( mostly high-pressure natural gas transmission line ) .
following a number of major accident involving industrial activity ( including those at flixborough , humberside in 1974 ; beek , the netherlands in 1975 ; and seveso and manfredonia in italy in 1976 ) , the ec issued a directive on major accident hazard .
the directive , which is commonly referred to a the â€˜ seveso â€™ directive , wa issued in june 1982 and in the uk it requirement were embodied in the control of major accident hazard ( cimah ) regulation ( 1984 ) .
among other thing , these regulation require operator of hazardous installation to draw up on-site and off-site emergency plan and to give information to member of the public who live or work near such installation ( houston 1987 ) .
there are presently about 300 cimah site .
however , many potentially hazardous chemical installation are not covered by such regulation .
clearly , a plant which store 1 tonne le than is required for notification slip through the net , while large number of handling site ( warehouse , for instance ) are not covered .
the regulation have obvious implication for g1s work , a illustrated below .
in halton borough , cheshire , for instance , there are 13 notifiable installation , with over 20 000 people living within the defined â€˜ consultation zone â€™ ( petts 1988 ) .
it is also relevant to point out here the work of the health and safety executive in developing technique for quantitative risk assessment ( health and safety executive 1989 ) .
such technique include the use of a â€˜ risk assessment tool â€™ ( riskat ) , input to which include data on wind direction and speed ; the output of which is a map of calculated risk contour .
in societal risk assessment â€˜ it is also necessary to input data on the distribution of population around the installation .
this can be a difficult and time-consuming process , and inevitably some simplifying assumption are needed â€™ ( health and safety executive 1989 : 17 ) .
again , the g1s implication are clear and are discussed below .
hazardous waste disposal
the disposal of both nuclear and non-nuclear waste ha proved to be of major public concern in recent year .
the rather clumsy handling by nirex of the search for site to store low- and intermediate-level waste , together with very recent worry about the import of toxic waste such a polychlorinated biphenyls ( pcbs ) , are but two example of such concern in the uk .
however , while the former ha been given considerable attention by geographer ( summarized by openshaw et al. 1989 ) there ha been relatively little such work in the uk on the disposal of non-nuclear waste .
this contrast with the situation in the usa ( greenberg and anderson 1984 ) , where the clean-up of abandoned site is a priority .
certainly , in term of the volume of waste generated in the uk non-nuclear hazardous industrial waste should be high on the environmental agenda ; while le than 1 million tonne of all nuclear waste were generated in 1985â€“86 , 10 time that amount were generated of hazardous waste ( openshaw et al. 1989 : 13 ) .
attention should be drawn to the three annual report of the hazardous waste inspectorate ( now merged with other branch of the doe to form her majesty 's inspectorate of pollution ) .
these contain some valuable material on disposal practice , and volume of waste generated and disposed of by each waste regulation authority ( wra ) â€” county in england , district in wale , scotland and northern ireland .
each wra is required to produce a waste disposal plan and these are starting to appear .
they too contain useful material on , for instance , the location of site , though individual site licence must be consulted for detail of what each is permitted to take in the way of hazardous waste .
what is not known is information on the location of former site , at which quite toxic material may have been dumped , though recent work by egger ( 1989 ) in austria ha mapped a vast number of such site .
it is these , rather than existing , licensed site which should be a focus of research activity , particularly when examining possible link to ill health .
we simply do not have enough evidence yet to back up the claim that â€˜ people are almost certainly ill , dead , or dying because of these sloppy waste disposal activity â€™ ( openshaw et al. 1989 : 12 ) .
research is in progress , however , to ass possible health effect of poor incineration ( diggle et al. 1990 ) .
particular attention should be focused on hospital incinerator , since these have been subject to crown immunity for many year and most are technically ill-equipped to burn at sufficiently high temperature for adequate disposal of waste ( gatrell and lovett 1991 ) .
we need to produce an inventory of all such site , together with a publicly available , comprehensive database on all site accepting hazardous industrial waste .
emergency planning
it is convenient to retain the nuclear/non-nuclear distinction when discussing the background to emergency planning .
nuclear emergency planning in the uk ha been reviewed by matthew and pepper ( 1981 ) .
nuclear power station must prepare a plan and submit this to the nuclear installation inspectorate and health and safety executive for approval .
evacuation plan are required to cover an area within a distance of 2.4 km ; these detail the role to be played by the emergency service .
the very narrow emergency planning zone contrast with those in the usa ( collins 1981 ) , where planning is required up to 16 km from the site to cover exposure to radiation plume .
local authority in the uk that have declared themselves â€˜ nuclear-free â€™ have been highly critical of british planning , calling for an extension of emergency zone to at least 24 km .
zeigler et al. ( 1983 ) should be consulted for material relating to evacuation behaviour in the wake of the incident at three mile island .
in the uk little work of any description seems to have been done on human behaviour in the aftermath of release of hazardous substance , nor is much available on public attitude to emergency planning .
indeed , no major study of evacuation due to hazard have been undertaken in recent time and this is a widely recognized deficiency which no research funding body seems willing to rectify .
in the usa on the other hand , a good deal of useful research in these area ha been undertaken .
this research is brought together in very useful report produced by the oak ridge national laboratory , tennessee ( sorenson et al. 1987 ; vogt and sorenson 1987 ) and the disaster research centre , university of delaware .
perry ( 1985 ) ha written an interesting book on emergency planning and evacuation , covering both natural and technological hazard .
for him , comprehensive emergency planning and management involve : prevention , protection , response and restoration .
by prevention we understand the elimination or reduction in risk , perhaps by adequate zoning or safe routeing of shipment , for instance .
included in protection are method for detecting likely hazard event and in warning those likely to be affected .
response includes search and rescue ( including the need to cope with secondary threat such a contamination of water supply after an explosion , or fire following an earthquake ) .
a perry and others have noted , relatively few resource are devoted to the first two aspect , the bulk going to response and restoration ( rebuilding ) .
it should be clear from this brief description that these issue are inherently geographical .
in one of the few study of evacuation behaviour after a non-nuclear hazard event liverman and wilson ( 1981 ) give weight to this argument .
in 1979 a train carrying chlorine , liquid petroleum , toluene and propane wa derailed in mississauga , ontario , causing a series of explosion .
this led to the evacuation of 250 000 people which , although staggered over several day , led to great pressure on transport artery .
an important finding wa that many relied on their own transport and went to stay with friend and relative some distance away , rather than relying on the 19 official evacuation reception centre .
despite this , the evacuation wa successful , partly because the accident occurred at a weekend and the immediately affected area wa sparsely populated .
in addition , the police were well prepared , stimulated largely by implementing a plan designed more to cope with an emergency at the nearby toronto international airport than for the event in question .
it is not without interest to note that in the usa there is a federal emergency management agency ( fema ) , established in 1978 , charged with dealing with all type of emergency planning and management .
in the uk there is no equivalent , though the spate of disaster in the past 4 year ( involving over 1000 life lost ) ha led to several call for such a national body to be established .
natural hazard
in this short space it is not possible to go into any depth on the nature of particular natural hazard but only to highlight those aspect relevant to gi .
needle to say , the study of natural hazard is important , a statement brought into sharp focus by the fact that natural hazard account for up to 4 per cent of total death in the world each year ( mitchell , 1974 ) .
in 1970 , for example , more than 200 000 people died in the cyclone and flooding of bangladesh and in 1979 the hurricane david and frederick caused more than $3bn damage in the usa .
shah ( 1983 ) made a comprehensive investigation of natural disaster report for the period 1974â€“80 and concluded that both disaster frequency and magnitude ( measured in term of life lost ) are increasing .
high death toll are still a characteristic of le developed , low-income country .
surprisingly , fog is the third most important hazard in europe after flood and volcano .
research on natural hazard ha a long tradition in geography going back more than half a century .
much of the impetus for such research arose in the usa from observation on river basin management and the need to reduce flood damage .
the vast majority of natural hazard study have ignored the physical nature of the event per se and have concentrated on behavioural issue such a the perception and estimation of hazard .
this emphasis is partly due to the background of the researcher involved ( many are human geographer and sociologist ) and partly because it is only really since the second world war that major hazard have been monitored systematically , culminating , of course , in the last decade or so in the use of satellite technology .
brief reference to two example of natural hazard may illustrate the potential relevance of a gi approach , application of which are considered below .
jones et al. ( 1989 ) have examined the distribution of some 8500 landslide in the uk .
their map show clearly an increased propensity for landsliding in the north and west of the uk .
more to the point , however , is the fact that this distribution can be modelled in term of slope , rainfall , rock type and so on .
in other word the actual hazard distribution can be understood and area at risk identified .
the potential benefit to insurance company , engineer and planner are clear .
second , a well-known winter hazard in the uk , with marked spatial localization , is fog .
predictive model of it distribution have clear implication for road and air safety .
perry ( 1981 ) describes a fog potential index that is a function of local topography , environmental feature affecting fog formation and distance from standing water body .
reliance is currently placed on a network of monitoring station , often sparsely located and frequently outside fog-prone area ; gi could implement a predictive model based on digitized map feature and indeed the model could also be used in site allocation study for airport and the like .
the majority of natural hazard research ha focused on single hazard but of course any area may be prone to more than one hazard type .
this idea led hewitt and burton ( 1971 ) to develop the concept of â€˜ all-hazards-at-a-place â€™ .
to achieve this they concentrated on the whole spectrum of damaging event in an area and explored their aggregate impact .
the implication for gi in the development of â€˜ hazardousness â€™ index are obvious and if time-series data are available there is the potential to produce a variety of probability map .
the collection of historical data on natural hazard is important since it is clear that their spatial pattern varies through time .
many area that appear to be hazard-free on current map may merely by passing through a temporary period of quiescence .
this is perhaps best illustrated with reference to earthquake .
for example , in 1692 , the whole of southern england wa affected by an earthquake whose epicentre wa located in what is now belgium ; a good deal of minor structural damage wa inflicted ( morse 1983 ) .
presumably the builder of the channel tunnel are aware of this ?
environmental epidemiology
this is , of course , a vast subject area , embracing the impact of the natural and technological environment on human health .
it cover , for instance , the association between water and air pollution and ill health , link between geological and pedological environment and ill health , a well a association between specific technological hazard ( e.g. high-voltage power line ) and possible health effect .
we can only consider a small fraction of this work here ; little consideration is given to occupational environment , for instance .
in the uk such research is widespread though there are specialist environmental epidemiology research institute at southampton and cardiff ( funded by the medical research council ) , and others at the university of surrey ( robens institute ) and at the london school for hygiene and tropical medicine .
the latter house the small area health statistic research unit ( sahsru ) , which ha a specific remit to conduct research into morbidity and mortality at local scale ( elliot 1988 ) .
the sahsru liaises closely with opcs .
the kind of database used by these group are discussed below .
greenberg ( 1983 ) and a collection of paper in greenberg ( 1987 ) review some of the literature on environmental epidemiology .
it seems worth stating at the outset that there are two way geographical research in this general area can proceed .
one is to collect morbidity and mortality data ( usually the latter is more widely available , though the former more useful ) and to examine spatial distribution for clustering .
this ha itself generated a substantial literature ( see the paper in elliot 1988 for an overview ) and is nowhere better exemplified than in openshaw 's geographical analysis machine ( see ch. 2 ) .
we then search retrospectively for evidence of possible environmental association .
an alternative approach is to begin by hypothesizing an environmental determinant of ill health and to collect data to test an explicit hypothesis .
if an association is suggested then we would want to collect data in other area to ass the hypothesis further .
of course , these two approach are not clear-cut in practice ; in many case the hypothesis of interest will have themselves been generated by inductive mapping .
one example of an hypothesis which ha been given serious attention in recent year is the possible link between electromagnetic field generated by high-voltage power line or supply cable and ill health .
some work ( perry et al. 1981 ) suggested association with mental illness and suicide , while others ( e.g. wertheimer and leeper 1982 ) have examined link to various cancer , including leukaemia .
a good bibliography is provided in perry and pearl ( 1988 ) .
the central electricity generating board ( now privatized and split into two company ) is funding a large-scale , 2-year project to ass link to childhood cancer , while another recently announced study aim to look at link to sudden infant death .
one obvious problem , with implication for any gi input , is that the effect are highly localized , with little measurable field effect more than a few dozen metre away from the route centre-lines .
accuracy of digital data collection ( either of the power line or residential location ) is paramount .
there seems to be a growing interest in examining association between ill health and the geological environment .
gi work in this field ( e.g. matthew 1989 ) is reviewed later , but we note here the work of the applied geochemistry group at imperial college ( responsible for a series of atlas on regional geochemistry ) and the existence of a society for environmental geochemistry and health .
one area of recent debate concern radon gas and it link to lung cancer .
this is taken very seriously in the usa , where the environmental protection agency estimate that 10 000â€“20 000 death from lung cancer each year are due to radon gas exposure .
estimate from scandinavia suggest that 10â€“30 per cent of such death are caused by exposure to radon ( richardson 1988 : 270â€“81 ) .
the gas is trapped in well-insulated house and is produced by the decay of uranium in rock and soil ; thus it ha been measured at high concentration in part of cornwall and devon .
there are great difficulty in assessing health effect , however , since exposure varies greatly from house to house within small neighbourhood .
carefully designed case-control study are therefore required to measure the separate effect of radon exposure after controlling for smoking behaviour and other risk factor .
other health concern which might merit attention by those involved in the regional research laboratory ( rrl ) initiative include air and water pollution .
the debate about lead pollution from vehicle exhaust emission is well known ; le publicity ha been given to pahs ( polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon ) , a product of combustion process and known to be carcinogenic ( lioy and daisey 1987 ) .
research at the north west regional research laboratory ( nwrrl ) aim to create buffer around busy road and junction and to use data from the cancer registry to examine possible link between proximity to such source of pollution and prevalence of lung cancer .
those with an interest in health and air pollution should note the availability of a very detailed database from the warren spring laboratory , containing detail of smoke and sulphur dioxide emission at a large number of site in the uk .
the possible link between nitrate in water and stomach cancer is the subject of much debate ( beresford 1985 ) , a is the association between aluminium content and alzheimer 's disease .
the problem of assessing such link are , of course , huge , but there is scope for a contribution .
the role of gi in hazard management scenario â€” example
a we have already implied , gi ha a role to play in all aspect of hazard research , from hazard monitoring , risk assessment and emergency planning to coping with an event and evaluating it consequence .
the example described below illustrate all these , though a yet there do not appear to be many instance of disaster in the management of which gi ha played a significant part .
technological hazard , emergency planning and gi
a considerable amount of research ha been undertaken to apply gi method to evacuation scenario around hazardous site .
much of this research ha concentrated on network analysis of the road system .
reference wa made above to so-called cimah site , major hazardous installation for which on-site and off-site emergency plan must be prepared .
early research at the nwrrl focused on developing a gi for use by the police and county emergency planning officer in cumbria that would aid in the management of a possible explosion at a chemical factory in whitehaven , west cumbria ( vincent et al. 1988 ; dunn 1989 ) .
the police required a portable system that could be implemented on an ibm-compatible microcomputer .
this wa written at the nwrrl using fortran 77 and the graphical kernel system .
the gi is menu-based and is exceptionally user-friendly ( pl. 10.1 ) .
it open with an outline map and the superimposition of the rather rigid zone used by the emergency planner .
full zoom facility are available at any stage .
in any emergency it is of course vital to have high-quality data on the distribution of population and resource .
the system incorporates digitized data on the distribution of all domestic and non-domestic property in the town together with digitized road centre-line data .
both set of data were provided by pinpoint analysis ltd , who are undertaking this digitizing task for the entire country .
other spatially referenced data incorporated into the system include those on the distribution of school , medical and transport service which can be displayed and supplementary information about them obtained .
the gi permit population estimate to be made for any arbitrary rectangular region on the map .
most significantly , it incorporates a shortest path algorithm which us the road network to find optimal route between user-defined start and end node .
although predating the rrl initiative by several year â€” and , indeed the emergence of gi a a major research area â€” we should remind ourselves of openshaw 's work on appraising nuclear reactor site .
using what would now be called gi skill , openshaw ( 1980 ) examined over 13 000 1 km grid square in the uk which intersect the coastline and related these to data from the 1971 census ( which were made available for such grid square ) .
he demonstrated that there is an abundance of â€˜ remote â€™ site , in contrast to the official view that such site were increasingly hard to find .
he suggested that in early spatial search for site â€˜ only a small number were ever identified in the first place because rigorous search could not be performed by manual mean with poor quality data â€™ ( openshaw 1980 : 289 ) .
heywood and cornelius ( 1989 ) have shown how gi can be used for monitoring possible radiation release and thus the relevance of gi in nuclear emergency planning and monitoring .
they propose a national radiological spatial information system and , in a pilot project in cumbria , have integrated several layer of data within arc/info to show what this might involve ( fig. 10.2 ) .
such data include those from the population and agricultural census a well a point data from rain gauge site and radiation monitoring station .
a an example , the system is used to determine restriction zone for the movement of sheep after the explosion at chernobyl in 1986 .
this is done by finding area of high rainfall and parish with high sheep population .
the map overlay of point and area information show generally good agreement with the restriction zone imposed by the ministry of agriculture , fishery and food , with the exception of a small area to the south-east of cumbria , bordering on lancashire .
the british government carried out a review of it arrangement for handling nuclear accident overseas following the chernobyl accident .
the doe , through her majesty 's inspectorate of pollution ( hmip ) , wa given the task of co-ordinating a national response plan , installing the radiation monitoring network and acting a lead government department in an emergency ( hmso 1988 ) .
the monitoring network ha become known a the radioactive incident monitoring network ( rimnet ) and ha , a it prime responsibility , the detection of abnormal increase in radiation level within the uk of the kind that might arise from an overseas nuclear accident .
the full implementation of the rimnet system will take some time .
by the end of 1988 gamma radiation dose monitor had been installed at 46 meteorological station a part of phase 1 of the development programme .
radiation reading are taken every hour at each station and are transmitted to a central computer which analysis the data .
the current criterion for alert is two reading of more than three time normal background , either successively at the same site or simultaneously at two adjacent site .
the dissemination of information in the event of an incident is dealt with at three level : the first is the normal system of press notice ; the second is the use of teletext and viewdata ( ceefax and prestel ) to get direct to member of the public at their home or place of work ; the third is the use of telecom gold electronic mail to get more technical detail to various official body , such a water authority ( jackson 1989 ) .
phase 2 of the rimnet scheme will be completed by the end of 1991 when between 80 and 90 monitoring site will have been established .
given very wide regional and local variation in deposition , question must be raised about the effectiveness of such a small network ; local authority will need to supplement it with their own network .
there are important analytical problem to be addressed concerning the siting of such monitoring equipment and these are elaborated on later .
abroad , kaspar ( 1981 ) ha discussed a computer-based exercise , with gi overtone , involving the simulated evacuation of the population living in the vicinity of the neckarwestheim nuclear power plant in baden wã¼rttemberg .
in the scenario he outline , an area affected by radioactive release is determined , the population within that area is allocated to reception area ( with capacity constraint ) , evacuation route are identified and traffic restriction implemented .
little detail is provided , however , and it is thus difficult to evaluate his work fully .
dangermond ( 1985 ) describes the use of the arc/info network module for use in emergency planning situation .
he describes how a road network is digitized and subsequently analysed using allocation , districting and routeing algorithm .
allocation determines which arc in the network will be allocated to a particular node or centre ; districting make it possible to outline rapidly set of polygon in order to define specific area of interest ( district ) and to summarize their characteristic ; routeing provides a minimum path algorithm through the network , the arc of which can be assigned weight according to road condition , road capacity and so on .
dangermond give several example in his paper including the use of network for the allocation of emergency vehicle , optimum routeing of fire engine from garage to the accident scene and the movement of spill through sewer and river network .
when combined with the other facility in arc/info , quite complex disaster management scenario can be handled .
for example , earthquake fault zone can be combined with data on housing density and structural detail to predict earthquake damage level and these data then related to the network model .
vincent ( 1989 ) illustrates the use of arc/info and it network module for finding safe route for chlorine transhipment on the road and rail system of north-west england ( pl. 10.2 ) .
in this case , population density data for a 1 km buffer on either side of network arc were overlaid on the network itself so a to act a weight for the minimum path algorithm .
chosen route were those which minimized population rather than distance .
hazardous waste disposal
there can be little doubt that a gi approach ha wide applicability in all sort of location problem where the goal is to minimize ( rather than , a conventionally , maximize ) accessibility to a population .
a particularly good application is to the search for potential site for the disposal of nuclear and non-nuclear ( but none the le hazardous ) waste .
we discus here some relevant work on the siting of facility for the disposal of nuclear waste before examining those for non-nuclear waste .
the major contribution to informed debate about the search for site for the disposal of nuclear waste ha come from a group of geographer ( openshaw et al. 1989 ) and a gi approach to this problem can pay high dividend .
the work of carver ( see openshaw et al. 1989 : ch. 7 ) is an interesting example .
one advantage is the ability to model a range of alternative by allowing particular criterion to enter or be omitted from the polygon overlay operation .
conceptually , what is offered is little more than an automated â€˜ sieve mapping â€™ that land-use planner have used for many year , but the whole procedure is speeded up by many order of magnitude using gi software .
the author examine both near-surface site and deep repository ( which use more restricted population criterion and allow offshore location to enter ) .
data layer include geological map , conservation area , transport route , petrochemical facility and demographic data .
a different layer are added sequentially we see how the proportion of available land shrink ( pl. 10.3 ) ; for instance , when geological criterion are set in the search for a deep repository , 25 per cent of land area remains and the addition of the population density layer reduces this to 24 per cent .
however , adding a proximity to transport constraint lower this to 12 per cent ; and so on .
we can not pretend gi is a solution to the political problem of negotiation and justification but at the very least the openness of the procedure go some way towards satisfying a worried public .
gi research into site selection for non-nuclear hazardous waste ha been almost exclusively conducted in north america and ha yet to be matched in the uk .
jensen and christiansen ( 1986 ) , working in the south-eastern usa , use a raster approach ( with a pixel resolution of 20 m&sup2 ; ) and boolean overlay to â€˜ weed out â€™ particular site , such a those which are poorly drained , environmentally sensitive or inaccessible ( see also stewart 1987 ) .
environmental monitoring of site for the disposal of toxic waste is of particular concern in the usa .
the comprehensive environmental response , compensation and liability act ( cercla ) legislation of 1980 ( â€˜ superfund â€™ ) requires the cleaning up of the worst landfill site , of which some 800 had been identified by the environmental protection agency by 1986 ( foresman 1986 ) .
a major worry ha been the threat posed by groundwater pollution and some research ha been conducted on using gi to monitor this ( merchant et al. 1987 ; barringer et al. 1987 ; von braun 1988 ) .
this is an important topic since 95 per cent of rural household in the usa consume only groundwater , while half the u population consumes at least some groundwater ( merchant et al. 1987 ) .
clearly , the research demand access to exceptionally good environmental data , usually in three dimension .
a foresman ( 1986 ) suggests , we might expect remote sensing technology to play a major role .
merchant et al. ( 1987 ) for example , use the image processing system erdas to construct an index of vulnerability to groundwater pollution ; this us variable such a depth to water table , soil type , slope and so on ( see estes et al. 1987 for a similar approach ) .
barringer et al. ( 1987 ) overlay data on soil type and geology with that of groundwater quality ( hardness and corrosivity measure ) and build a linear model which show that the background environmental variable are good predictor of the water quality index .
again , a raster-based approach is used .
a further example is work by von braun ( 1988 ) who us pmap to look at exposure of organic and metallic compound in groundwater in the vicinity of tucson airport , arizona .
using plume model that predict the movement of contaminant she is able to intersect the result with data on current well location and to ass which water supply area are worst contaminated .
overlaying the result with residential location data provides â€˜ map delineating location-specific exposure for each residence in each time-period â€™ ( von braun 1988 ; 1160 ) .
in principle , it is then possible to compare such â€˜ dos â€™ with epidemiological data , once again indicating a link from a hazard event to assessment of health outcome .
attention should be drawn to foresman 's comment that the u geological survey ( usgs ) ( at the eros data centre ) have successfully linked arc/info to a model of groundwater flow ( foresman 1986 : 260 ) .
this kind of link between gi and other modelling program is to be warmly welcomed and parallel work at the nwrrl in linking gi and air pollution plume model .
natural hazard and disaster management
several study in recent paper have shown the effectiveness of gi in mitigating the effect of major natural hazard .
berke and ruch ( 1985 ) , for example , describe a gi for assessing the impact of hurricane on the texas gulf coast .
hurricane damage through high wind and tidal surge cause an immense amount of destruction and pose a major threat to many coastal community in the usa .
it ha been estimated , for example , that during the mid 1970s some 50 million u citizen were subject to hurricane wind of over 160 km/h and 6 million were subject to hurricane surge ( brinkman 1975 ) .
the system described by berke and ruch ( 1985 ) is raster-based and ha an interesting modelling component called slosh ( sea , lake and overland surge from hurricane ) .
slosh is able to estimate still water surge by grid cell for various hurricane intensity , angle of approach to the shoreline , forward movement speed and landfall location .
additional algorithm are used to model total building damage cost for each grid cell based on water-depth and speed-depth rating curve .
hobeika and jamei ( 1985 ) describe the massevacuation ( massvac ) simulation software designed to analyse and evaluate traffic evacuation plan given a natural disaster in an urban area .
the system comprises three interrelated module : community and disaster type characteristic module ; population distribution module ; network evacuation module .
the type of natural disaster determines the time period within which the road network ha to be evacuated .
the control and management strategy are directly correlated to each specific disaster scenario .
massvac is quite flexible and various user-defined road network option are available such a : traffic signal timing on the road network ; one-way traffic ; reserved lane for special vehicle such a those of the emergency service .
hobeika and jamei have tested massvac on various evacuation scenario for virginia beach city in order to determine evacuation time for flood and hurricane condition .
in general , they suggest that the model provided reasonable and reliable evacuation time .
southworth et al. ( 1989 ) have enhanced the massvac model with the addition of a colour graphic module which they call mvopl .
this module ha been developed using ibm 's graphic kernel system and provides a number of display screen .
the most interesting are those which portray population flow a scaled ribbon on the network diagram , and evacuation shelter capacity a bar diagram .
the diagram are updated periodically during the course of the simulation .
in dry part of the world , such a australia , forest and bush fire are an important natural hazard and some attention ha been given to the way in which gi might help examine their potential impact .
kessell ( 1988 ) describes a pc-based gi called preplan ( pristine environment planning language ) which is a natural area management , land-use planning and fire modelling system developed for the australian national park and wildlife service , preplan comprises four module : a simple raster-based gi ; a grid cell resource database ; a wide range of vegetation , fuel , fire behaviour , erosion and land-use model ; tabular , statistical and colour graphic output system .
with this system real-time fire growth can be modelled , taking into account change in terrain , fuel and temporal change in the weather .
kessell point out that uncontrollable fire are recurrent phenomenon in many part of australia , causing damage in the hundred of million of dollar and significant loss of life .
system such a preplan can provide the user with sound model of the behaviour pattern of fire and are therefore of enormous value in land-use planning .
one of the most widespread natural hazard is flooding , and the potential for loss of property , risk to life and general social disruption is large .
one interesting example of a gi approach to flood damage estimation is the anuflood package which wa developed in the early 1980s following detailed flood damage study for flood-prone coastal town in northern new south wale , australia ( smith and greenaway , 1988 ) .
the anuflood system requires locational and building type data on individual property , stage-damage curve relating the average damage that would result from overfloor flooding to differing depth for each property type , and lastly , flood frequency in term of flood height expressed a a probability .
output from the system is both tabular and graphical .
of particular interest is the construction of map showing the expected annual amount of damage for gridded flood-prone area .
anuflood also contains module which permit the investigation of various flood damage mitigation option , such a property height raising , levee construction and flood proofing .
environmental epidemiology
the possibility sketched above relate to emergency planning , the search for hazardous site , and risk assessment .
to what extent can gi help if an event occurs ?
what , for instance , of the health consequence ?
there is a rich tradition of epidemiological work in geography and with the increasing availability of spatially referenced medical data the scope for gi application is wide ( gatrell 1987 ) .
for instance , diggle et al. ( 1990 ) ass the hypothesis that cancer of the larynx is associated with proximity to a now-closed incinerator and develop a statistical model from the theory of spatial point process to test this .
this would have been impossible without the link provided from postcoded data ( increasingly available from source such a cancer registry ) to ordnance survey ( o ) grid reference .
such a link is provided by the central postcode directory , which match all 1.5 million unit postcode in the uk to grid reference .
when the case of laryngeal cancer are compared with a null distribution ( provided by the distribution of much more common lung cancer ) the hypothesis is given strong support .
although the proposed method is novel , it is but one of an increasingly large number of method designed to detect and model â€˜ cluster â€™ of disease ( see , for example , cuzick and edward 1990 ) .
the work of diggle et al. ( 1990 ) examined only a single point source , though it generalizes to multiple source and to linear hazard a well .
a a second example of health work linked to hazard study we may cite the research being conducted by cross ( 1989 ) on childhood leukaemia .
there are numerous hypothesis concerning the aetiology of this disease ( from ionizing radiation to viral transmission ) and cross 's approach is to collect digital data designed to test some of these hypothesis and to use arc/info to display and analyse result .
for instance , one hypothesis concern the role of electromagnetic radiation , a source of which is overhead high-voltage transmission line a noted earlier .
if these are digitized and buffer zone constructed around them ( fig. 10.3 ) we can quite easily test hypothesis about prevalence in such buffer zone a compared with prevalence outside .
however , we should bear in mind the earlier point about the resolution of the data , since such electromagnetic effect have a very weak effect beyond perhaps 50 m ( wertheimer and leeper 1982 ) .
there ha been a suspicion for many year that high rate of stomach cancer in part of wale may be linked to soil chemistry , specifically such factor a zinc/copper ratio , and to lead content in water supply .
matthew ( 1989 ) ha used data from the regional cancer registry ( morbidity rather than mortality data ) and data on trace element to examine this link .
since the latter are available for a 5 km raster the registration data are assigned to these grid square using the o grid reference .
a with any such study there are the usual problem of ecological analysis and influence of migration , together with issue of separating out the risk factor under investigation from possible confounding factor .
in the usa , morrill 's report on the beginning of a $15m. study into the possible radiation dos received a result of radiation release by the hanford ( washington state ) nuclear complex would seem to cry out for gi skill to be applied ( morrill 1989 ) .
the research project will employ plume dispersion model in order to model dispersal by wind and will need to integrate this and other environmental data with detailed demographic record .
to some extent this line of approach wa anticipated by johnson ( 1981 ) in his study of exposure to plutonium fall-out from the rocky flat nuclear weapon plant near denver ( see zeigler et al. 1983 : 47â€“8 ) .
using soil sample he constructed a contoured risk surface and then mapped excess cancer in various distance band , detecting a marked distance decay effect .
research problem and prospect
the work reviewed above suggests that the application of gi technique to hazard assessment , emergency planning and environmental monitoring is both actually and potentially an important research area with many challenging problem .
undoubtedly , the gi of the 1990s will look very different from their rather primitive ancestor .
computer power is becoming cheaper , digital data more readily available , and gi are becoming hybrid system involving other technology .
in this last section we highlight some important research area a we see them .
doubtless there are many others , such is the surge of interest in gi technology .
data availability
we should first consider the availability and quality of data concerning the population who may be at risk from the storage and transport of hazardous substance , from toxic air pollution , from flooding and so on .
such data are crucial , either for assisting the emergency service to make assessment about resource they need to deploy in such event , or for high-quality estimate to be made of risk .
within the public domain in the uk we must rely in general on data from the most recent population census , the lowest level being that for enumeration district ( ed ) .
a is well known ( rhind 1983 ) these contain on average perhaps 150â€“200 household and 400â€“500 people .
the boundary ed have not been widely digitized , unlike the higher-level electoral ward .
however , the centroid of ed are available a 100 m grid reference and artificial ed â€˜ polygon â€™ can be created if necessary .
in some instance such data will suffice ; in many case they will have to suffice a nothing better is available .
but in some area ed are very extensive physical unit and the shape will be quite distorted .
furthermore , the scale at which population estimate are often required mean that even ed are too coarse for risk assessment .
for instance , in performing it quantitative risk assessment the health and safety executive will rarely deal with distance from hazardous site in excess of 1 km ( petts 1988 ) and census data will not offer sufficient resolution for accurate population estimate to be made .
it should be pointed out , however , that the national radiological protection board currently us 1 km grid square resolution population data from the 1971 census in it radiological protection study ( hallam et al. 1981 ) .
it would seem that , despite the cost involved , they should consider investing in the very detailed digital data ( pinpoint address code ( pac ) ) provided by pinpoint analysis ltd .
this area of application would appear to be an obvious market for such a product .
a useful research exercise would be to compare the use of census and pac data in deriving quantitative risk assessment and this is an interesting research problem .
even with pac data some assumption would need to be made about number of person per household if good population estimate were to be made .
more generally , we need to consider the availability of large database for hazard study and emergency planning and this is an area ripe for major initiative .
in the uk we seem to be lagging well behind the usa in the construction of database on hazardous site and especially hazard event such a those involving toxic release .
for instance , lioy and daisey ( 1987 ) , in their work on the monitoring of toxic air pollution in new jersey , construct what they term a â€˜ microinventory â€™ for each of three town , comprising the location of chemical plant , metal processing plant , paint spray manufacturer and so on .
some attribute information is available for these .
more closely linked to gi is work by mcmaster and johnson ( 1986 ) who perform a very detailed inventory of hazardous material ( both stored and transported ) in santa monica , california .
although the raster display are very crude it is simple to answer spatial query concerning the location of people ( for instance , particular age group ) within certain distance of toxic hazard site .
we have data on some hazardous site ( e.g. those regulated by cimah ) in the uk but a much more comprehensive approach should be adopted , especially if we are serious in the search for environmental association with chronic disease .
the same is true for toxic release .
in the usa the environmental protection agency produce an acute hazard event database while the department of transportation ha a database recording detail of 25 000 release of toxic material ; such detail include locational information , type and amount of material released , mode of release and resulting injury or death ( cutter and solecki 1989 ) .
can we not use gi technology to construct â€˜ risk mosaic â€™ ( zeigler et al. 1983 ) , at a variety of spatial scale , akin to hewitt and burton 's â€˜ hazardousness â€™ of a place ?
in the uk only a handful of county emergency planning department ( cumbria , for instance ) have built up resource database in digital form and this need to be promoted .
further afield , we need to recognize that some disaster ( most obviously chernobyl ) will have implication for more than one country so that environmental monitoring should take place with some kind of international co-ordination .
there will also be movement of hazardous cargo across frontier and there are clearly problem of risk assessment and planning for emergency at or near international boundary , or at sea and airport .
a noted above , the work of fedra ( 1989 ) is a major step in this direction , and link need to be forged between initiative in the uk and the rest of europe .
in term of database on hazardous waste , attention ha already been drawn to the waste disposal plan prepared by wras .
these give detail of present site location and some indication of permitted waste , though little or no information on closed and abandoned site .
however , for detail of disposal the individual site licence must be consulted .
the former hazardous waste inspectorate operated a large database on all site , with detail of permitted waste , including allowable quantity .
the database wa created by a commercial company , aspinwall ltd .
there are numerous potentially usable database for environmental epidemiological work .
opcs , of course , is a major data repository for medical statistic and their various monitor series are of use , though only at the scale of district health authority and above ( see gatrell and lovett 1988 for an example ) .
regional health authority will from time to time produce mortality data at ward level .
however , if cancer are of interest it is more appropriate to obtain data from regional cancer registry ; these data are morbidity rather than mortality data and are therefore more valuable .
the data are postcoded and may have some occupational detail .
for example , we have received data from the regional cancer registry in manchester comprising all cancer of the larynx and lung notified between 1974 and 1984 .
this large data set , to which grid reference have now been added , comprises information about nearly 40 000 individual .
it ha now been copied into ingres , a relational database management system , permitting query to be made about subset of the data ; for instance , all male between the age of 25 and 64 suffering from laryngeal cancer .
other data source on cancer are independent registry of malignancy .
an example is that on leukaemia , managed by the leukaemia research fund centre in leeds ( alexander et al. 1989 ) .
it should be noted that there are frequently major discrepancy between the regional registry and the specialist registry , partly because the latter receive notification directly from consultant .
indeed , working directly with consultant prof invaluable in gaining access to high-quality morbidity data .
two other potential source of data are worth mentioning .
first , attention should be drawn to the new directive from the department of health to regional and district health authority to review the health of the population .
this mean in practice that district medical officer are charged with preparing an annual report , presenting and interpreting epidemiological data , identifying local health problem and evaluating service outcome .
lancaster university is already heavily involved in the work of preston district health authority in this area .
second , family health service authority ( fhsas ) , are also required to take on these role , but from the viewpoint of primary health care service .
fhsas ( which correspond to non-metropolitan county and to metropolitan borough ) hold large database on service provided by general practitioner ; for instance , uptake of immunization and screening for breast and cervical cancer .
is it , we wonder , possible to contemplate bringing together some of these data source to form a national online health information system ( nohis ) , to parallel that for employment and unemployment ( townsend et al. 1987 ) ?
this might include data on morbidity and mortality , uptake of preventative medicine , service use and availability , at both primary and hospital level .
it would be a useful management tool , particularly in view of the reorganization taking place in the national health service .
it should not be forgotten that hazard themselves have geographical distribution yet there ha been little effort in the uk to develop public domain database .
are there hazard-prone area ?
is there a regional differentiation in hazard type ?
these are , of course , commercially important question and a good deal of money is going into the collection of such data by insurance company .
one well known database is major hazard incident data service ( mhidas ) global industrial hazard database which is currently being developed by the safety and reliability directorate on behalf of the major hazard assessment unit of the uk health and safety directorate .
this system currently run in dbase ii and contains in excess of 3000 item of professionally assessed information on major hazard coded into some 24 separate field .
unfortunately , the spatial referencing is poor and with some effort this could easily be remedied .
it is , for example , little use when recording a chemical spill into an egyptian river to have entered into the appropriate field â€˜ the nile â€™ â€” after all , this river is some 6480 km long !
here , in our view , is a classic case of the absence of a geographical input rendering the data of limited value .
in some case , good hazard data exist but have simply not yet found their way into a gi .
a case in point is inland and coastal flooding .
most river authority have detailed map showing the geographical limit of flood in relation to their return period .
within the next decade , a the privatized water company develop their gi , we shall see a massive amount of data conversion in this area .
this development , together with the availability of digital terrain model , will allow quite sophisticated flood forecasting model to be developed within a gi framework .
a sea-levels rise in the next 20â€“30 year due to the â€˜ greenhouse â€™ effect , this very practical use of gi technology is likely to become commonplace and of considerable practical importance .
spatial statistic
another way in which there need to be a rapprochement between statistical method and gi is in the area of spatial sampling and estimation from spatial sample .
this is clearly an important issue in radiation monitoring a the discussion of rimnet above implies .
a an example , peirson ( 1988 ) ha reviewed the evidence on artificial radioactivity in cumbria and show map of the distribution of certain radionuclides a contoured surface .
the point worth making here is that there are many alternative scheme for interpolating from irregular point data ( lam 1983 ) .
one method in particular , kriging ( now available a part of the uniras software ) , offer not only a contoured surface but also an estimate of the standard error at any point on the map .
where this is high it suggests that an additional sampling station might be set up .
such technique are now standard in environmental science ( see streit 1981 for an application to rainfall monitoring ) and need to be promoted vigorously in hazard study ( estes et al. 1987 ) .
related to this problem is that of making population estimate for new zone that result from overlay operation .
we may want to count number living within plume , circle of fixed radius , buffer zone and so on .
existing gi technique usually base the estimate on area-weighted share , so that a new polygon created by â€˜ slicing â€™ an existing area in half is assigned half the population of that source unit .
this may be quite absurd in some case , notably where population is spatially clustered within a physically large ed .
at the nwrrl work is under way ( flowerdew and green 1989 ) to solve such problem using the em algorithm and the statistical modelling package glim , which ha been interfaced with arc/info .
operation research method and simulation
while there is some research activity in linking statistical model to gi there would seem to be scope for further application of operation research technique to gi problem .
within some sophisticated gi such a arc/info there are some useful algorithm ( such a shortest path calculation ) , but gi developer have in general failed to realize the natural link between gi function and many operation research technique .
over the last 20 year or so a large theoretical literature ha been developed to provide tool for the solution of many problem associated with emergency planning ( kolesar 1981 ) .
one important class of problem is the selection of location for the emergency service unit .
the choice of location need not be for permanent base , but can also include dynamic repositioning of unit a circumstance dictate ( kolesar and walker 1974 ) .
in any major emergency a typical problem is the assignment of resource to demand .
if resource are held at one set of location and the demand are at another and the cost of transportation are known , how do we allocate the resource most efficiently ?
in a major emergency , for example , there might be a need to supply blood product held at regional blood bank to hospital .
this , of course , is the classic transportation problem and it solution is well known .
a far a we know the microcomputer-based emergency response system devised by belardo et al. ( 1983 ) , is the only gis-like software to incorporate this algorithm .
in this system , the solution to the transportation problem is shown graphically on the road network , which is displayed on the computer screen .
a a last example of the potential role of operation research in gi and disaster management we are reminded of the logistic problem that faced the peel regional police force during the mississauga evacuation mentioned previously ( scanlon and padgham 1980 ) .
during the early state of the phased evacuation the logistical problem facing the police wa the street-by-street warning of the population to make ready for evacuation .
speed wa of the essence and manpower wa limited .
here , then , is a familiar operation research network problem : all road have to be traversed such that the journey length/time is a minimum .
this is the so-called chinese postman problem , which provides a hamiltonian circuit through the arc ( a compared with the travelling salesman problem which is a minimum route through the network node ) .
grant 's remains were shovelled into a canvas bag .
tense , facing outwards , forster , lawton and nell guarded delaney a he intoned the seaman 's prayer of interment , and then committed the canvas bag to the ocean .
the storm wa abating rapidly , the evening sky clearing in the west with the golden ray of the setting sun adding a dying colour to the sullen slate blue water .
the whiteness of the canvas body-bag dimmed beneath the onrushing sea , faded at the edge , then grew smaller , greener , and wa gone .
they returned to the bridge , fearful of every dark place â€” every corner , every door .
the gangway lamp seemed to give no light , only add further to the gloom of the dusk .
back in the wheelhouse , delaney faced them .
â€˜ right .
you all know the score .
a i see it we 've got two choice .
one , we get out of here now .
launch the lifeboat , take our chance , or â€¦ two , we go after whatever it is . â€™
nobody spoke immediately .
finally forster glanced at lawton for support , and drawled laconically .
â€˜ i 'm not leaving here until we 've done for that bastard .
it 's personal from now on in ! â€™
lawton nodded his agreement .
â€˜ yes , â€™ he said , â€˜ i feel the same . â€™
â€˜ nell ? â€™
delaney asked , looking at her squarely .
â€˜ i agree , â€™ she said without hesitation .
their tense , edgy face watched delaney closely .
â€˜ we do n't know what we 're up against , â€™ delaney said , â€˜ so let's proceed with maximum caution . â€™
â€˜ trouble is , â€™ lawton said , with a frown , â€˜ there are n't enough of u to search the ship .
it can work it way past u , and hide again .
we could still be looking for it when they blow u out of the water . â€™
â€˜ that 's why we 've got to take risk , â€™ nell put in .
â€˜ lure it into a trap , somehow .
and quickly .
forster 's chuckle wa mirthless .
â€˜ i do n't think this joker is going to need much encouragement . â€™
â€˜ no . â€™
delaney wa momentarily thoughtful .
â€˜ what had you in mind , nell ? â€™
she pointed to the figure of a man propped in the corner , and the cylinder of oxygen in the back pack lying beside it .
â€˜ two of our number have been killed .
each time when they were on their own .
let's give it the same condition , only this time we use that a the bait . â€™
they looked at the â€˜ man â€™ forster had found .
it wa a safety suit , an advanced model of the nbc type with it own oxygen tank .
â€˜ one in ambush , with the rest of u acting like beater .
start at one end of the ship , making a much noise a possible . â€™
forster grunted .
â€˜ it had no trouble finding grant .
i think it 's a good idea .
and i 'll go in the suit until we reach the ambush point .
might help to draw it . â€™
they helped him kit up , nell connecting the lead from the back pack into the suit attachment .
forster 's breathing whistled out of the one-way valve .
behind the clear , wide vizor , he tried to smile .
â€˜ cosy in here , â€™ he joked .
â€˜ even got my own toilet .
bloody handy in the circumstance . â€™
delaney took the lead .
it wa now light , the lamp on the gangway giving murky yellow pool that barely pushed back the inky blackness of a starless night .
at the entrance to the laboratory complex the others drew on their own mask .
ineffectual or not against lingering gas it seemed a wise precaution , even if it wa only psychological .
delaney glanced back at them .
â€˜ let's make sure it know where we are . â€™
they made noise ; slammed door .
nell shuddered .
were unseen eye watching them ?
wa it even now shadowing them , moving soundlessly from cover to cover , like a tiger in the steel jungle ?
forster 's radio-projected voice broke into her thought .
â€˜ look a good place . â€™
he wa at the entrance to the secure lab zone .
â€˜ this must be the only way in , â€™ nell said .
forster wa quickly de-suited .
a they set up the now empty suit with it back to the door , half slumped over a control panel , he settled down behind the curtained entrance of the shower .
delaney 's voice wa hushed .
â€˜ maybe we should leave two of u here ? â€™
â€˜ do n't want to rouse any suspicion .
forster wa adamant .
â€˜ after all , it might be able to count . â€™
when he did n't get any response , he patted the uzi beside him on the steel floor .
â€˜ i wo n't be unprepared like poor old grant . â€™
delaney pulled the curtain across , covering forster who cut a small slit in the opaque green plastic , widening it to give himself a better field of view .
lawton came and crouched down in front of it .
â€˜ i 've left the suit 's radio on full , â€™ he said .
â€˜ make it sound interesting if we talk occasionally . â€™
he hesitated .
â€˜ good luck . â€™
â€˜ i feel like a maharajah waiting for the tiger to pounce on the tied-up goat , â€™ forster grinned .
â€˜ i hope i do n't have to wait all night . â€™
nell shuddered .
night .
this wa a night in their mind â€” a creature from the darker side of man 's intellect .
something worried her about that thought .
something hidden behind the more obvious sentiment .
after they 'd gone , forster felt the silence physically settle around him .
he 'd never been one to exercise an over-imagination , yet the condition were like the feeling of a tomb â€” of an interment .
would he be found , he mused , a thousand year from then , a dust-covered skeleton ?
he chuckled .
and the uzi a primitive weapon , the bio suit mistaken for some sort of ceremonial armour ?
the first stunning silence gave way to the creaking of the ship and a far-off booming of the sea against the hull .
the radio on the dummy suddenly screeched into action a delaney 's distorted voice gave it life .
the thousand of ton of steel made real communication impossible .
his own radio wa off .
forster settled down , only putting his eye to the slit every half minute , not continually a he had started to do .
he had a good view of the long shadowy main corridor .
the only problem wa if â€” he corrected himself â€” when it came , which side turning , if any , would it use .
the further away the better .
the more time to see it approach .
the trouble wa the transverse corridor just outside the room .
if the approach wa that way he would get no warning at all , and it would be on top of george â€” his name for the dummy sitting like a drunken son-of-a-bitch â€” before he knew it .
if that happened , he 'd have to work fast .
what he 'd seen done to grant made forster realise that whatever it wa struck with demonic speed and savagery .
in second , poor old george would be spread around the room like an explosion in harrod 's window , and the thing would be away .
or on him .
a if in protest , george uttered a blood-curdling , lunatic-sounding cackle , and fell fractionally forward .
forster suppressed a nervous giggle .
they reached the main deck , dropping down
in a defensive posture , eye searching the stacked container , trying to probe the black , jagged recess between them .
lawton scanned upwards .
â€˜ it could be anywhere .
even back on the bridge again . â€™
â€˜ we should start in the engine room , â€™ nell suggested , shivering , â€˜ work up through the crew 's quarter , and then into the complex . â€™
confronted with the need to proceed ,
delaney took risk , plummeting foot first through the hatchway , and partly breaking his descent with the handrail , falling like a parachutist , rolling instantly deploying his uzi against â€¦
against what ?
like forster , all he could guess wa that it wa fast .
grant may have been lame , but â€¦ fast or silent ?
or both ?
the speed of descent must have cut down the exposure to any residual gas since he felt none of the earlier weirdness a he approached the still sealed engine room door .
pandora 's box ?
he winced at the memory a he hammered on the steel and then looked through the spy port .
in the stroboscopic view , the giant piston were the only thing moving â€” until a figure detached itself from the wall , it grey colour exactly that of the background steel .
like a chameleon , it moved out of the aisle between machine , then stopped , and became utterly motionless .
delaney 's stillness caught the attention of the others .
nell 's transceivered voice crackled in his headphone .
â€˜ what is it ? â€™
he did n't want to take his eye from it â€” equally he wanted somebody else to see it .
to confirm .
gently a though he might disturb it , he pulled back .
â€˜ take a look for yourself . â€™
she did â€” and caught her breath .
the creature wa large-headed , absurdly so , it body half man , half something lost in the primordial past .
but there could be no doubt that fundamentally it wa â€¦ human .
nell knew , and not only because she wa a female of the same specie .
she could see in it eye â€” intelligence .
and human fear .
but also , a a doctor , she knew exactly what it wa .
she told delaney , who shook his head with revulsion .
nell would never rest until she could get closer to confirm her worst suspicion , and paradoxically it wa the woman in her that provided the intensity of emotion that would let nothing stand in her way .
george , the sacrificial dummy , had n't emitted a squeak for a long time .
forster scanned the corridor once more .
it wa empty .
just a it always had been .
he sat back again , eyeing the blank wall before him , confident that he 'd catch it , however good it wa .
he kept wondering how it had got silk .
silk wa the meanest , toughest professional he 'd ever known .
and yet he 'd disappeared , without trace .
forster wa a fatalist .
he shrugged .
you could be james bond , he thought , but if something had your number on it â€¦
a gentle breeze broke the absolute silence , moving the curtain so that he had to steady it with his hand .
instantly alert , forster checked through his spy port .
nothing .
but a door had opened somewhere .
somebody , or something , had entered the complex .
it could be the others returning â€” or the start of his ambush .
â€˜ for god 's sake leave your mask on .
and that 's an order ! â€™
but delaney 's plea wa in vain .
nell pulled it off , got close to the door , and shouted .
â€˜ we mean you no harm .
you can help u . â€™
when she checked through the spyhole it wa standing in exactly the same spot , unmoving , like a lizard .
lawton shook his head .
â€˜ ca n't hear you .
try the ship 's system again . â€™
nell ran to the wall telephone , and pushed the digit for engine room .
the small light beneath the receiver rest showed that the line wa working .
worried , delaney followed , searching her face , fearing the tell-tale sign of toxicity .
on impulse , and against his better judgment , he pulled off his own mask .
nell repeatedly pressed the button , shouted across at lawton , who wa now using the spy port .
â€˜ what 's happening ? â€™
the back of lawton 's head shook , his radio-projected voice crackling .
â€˜ nothing now .
the head jerked , just the once , to the left , so i reckon it heard the â€˜ phone . â€™
he straightened up and came over , directing his question at delaney .
â€˜ we ought to get on . â€™
delaney nodded his agreement .
â€˜ leave it , nell . â€™
his tone wa sharp .
â€˜ it 's not going anywhere . â€™
she squared up to him , defiantly ,
â€˜ i ca n't , john .
do n't you see ?
the poor thing is part of this madness .
if we can get to it , i can learn so much more .
and in any case , it might die if we do n't try and help it â€¦ soon . â€™
delaney averted his gaze from her , afraid of what he had seen in her eye .
â€˜ perhaps it would be better if it did . â€™
â€˜ you do n't mean that , â€™ she said , stepping away from him .
delaney fiddled awkwardly with his mask , preparatory to putting it back on again .
â€˜ for god 's sake , nell .
all i mean is , we 've got a job to do .
and forster 's neck 's on the line .
do n't you owe it to him to come now ? â€™
she flushed , but held on to the â€˜ phone .
obviously striving to be a controlled a possible , she smiled .
â€˜ you two can manage , â€™ she said calmly .
â€˜ i can do better here , on my own .
quietly .
if i succeed it will unlock a lot of the mystery of what 's been done on titron .
and â€¦ â€™
she faltered .
â€˜ â€¦ i think we owe it to that pathetic creature in there . â€™
â€˜ pathetic ? â€™
delaney tried to play down the fear in his voice â€” fear for her .
â€˜ it might be bloody dangerous .
certainly , something on this ship is . â€™
â€˜ not this one , â€™ nell said , shaking her head with some kind of reassurance .
â€˜ i just know . â€™
lawton gestured in the gangway .
â€˜ you may not be at risk from what is in here .
what about out there ?
there 's no guarantee that what we 're hunting is going to follow the rule . â€™
nell shrugged .
â€˜ that 's a risk i 'll have to take .
i 've got a more important job here . â€™
delaney knew there wa no way she would be shifted from her chosen course .
ordering her would be ludicrous under the changed circumstance , and in any event , a waste of time .
but lawton wa right .
the risk from the other danger , or danger of titron , frightened him more .
â€˜ help me secure the stair behind u , â€™ he snapped at lawton , â€˜ a much a we can . â€™
delaney turned to nell .
â€˜ it might buy you the time you need .
but take care .
do n't be bloody foolish like i am , leaving you here .
establish contact if you can .
no more at this stage .
understand ?
and do n't try and get the door open . â€™
but nell wa hardly listening .
to please him she nodded , then despite lawton 's presence , squeezed delaney 's arm .
â€˜ and you . â€™
she smiled .
â€˜ watch out . â€™
reluctantly , delaney made for the gangway .
lawton had already shifted some chair , in readiness to form a barricade .
he gave him a hand with a large oil drum , and then another , a nell , tearing herself from her appointed task , dragged over a bench .
a they drew back up the stair , piling on the piece she threw up at them , lawton sniffed .
â€˜ this wo n't hold anything .
just slow it down . â€™
like forster before her , nell indicated her pistol and grenade .
â€˜ a long a there 's ti me , that 's all we need . â€™
a they descended the stair , delaney paused , and took a last look down at her .
she smiled shyly , then turned away .
in a sense , a long a he could convince himself that she wa safe , he wa glad she wa n't coming with them .
whatever it wa they were after , it wa an unknown quantity , unknown , that is , except for a lethal ferocity .
he pulled on his respirator , his mind made up to get back to her a soon a he could , for nell anderson wa all he cared about now .
there it went again .
forster frowned a he looked through his spy hole .
a sound .
he could n't place it , but it reminded him strongly of something .
the corridor wa empty .
it had happened three time now .
a hissing , we gas escaping , ending with a funny little squeak .
he looked at george , wondering if the sound had come from him .
satisfied that everything wa a it should be , he checked his watch .
well over half an hour had passed .
they ought to be near him soon .
forster searched in a pouch and came up with a glucose sweet .
quietly he unwrapped the covering paper , then paused , a some instinct made him check again .
a he did so , the sound came nearer ; louder .
his intense scrutiny took in the shadowy and empty length of the corridor .
apart from some dark patch on the wall that he had n't noticed before , there wa nothing to see .
his gaze came back to george , still sprawled over the control desk .
a fly landed on the empty , staring vizor , and crawled across it .
forster wa sorely tempted to nip out and confirm that the noise wa coming from george by twiddling the volume and tuner , but fought down the urge .
he sat back , pulled off his mask , and popped the sweet into his mouth .
it took him only second to notice the smell .
forster choked a the putrefying reek seemed to get right into him .
frightened that it wa a gas pocket , he fumbled with his mask , and finally got it back on .
his heart wa thumping .
nothing seemed to be happening , all his sens were apparently functioning normally , except â€¦ that the sweet in his mouth seemed permeated with the awful smell ; had become a slimy lump of filth .
he had to get rid of it .
forster reached for his mask , just a the hissing gas noise sounded right on top of him , ending with a little shriek .
he knew then where he 'd heard something similar before .
it wa like a man breathing through a respiratory system , with some sort of one-way valve .
a shadow fell across the wall opposite , a slowly , and fearfully he turned .
the curtain wa a dense , opaque greenish-yellow , and something wa right behind it , a shape pressing against the humped plastic standing there looking down at him , half seen , half imagined .
his hand went out , reached for the submachine gun , his finger tightening on the stock .
with a blood-curdling growl , the curtain wa snatched aside .
forster half rolled , his uzi trembling in his hand a he got off half a clip at point blank range .
but it struck with the speed of an attacking snake .
and something else ; something he saw a the curtain tore away and he looked into the depth of the unbelievable face above him , fractionally dulled his reflex .
friday 16 september to tuesday 20 september
once free of the knotted tentacle of the eastern suburb , dalgliesh made good time and by three he wa driving through lydsett village .
here a right turn took him off the coastal road on to what wa little more than a smoothly macadamed track bordered by water-filled ditch and fringed by a golden haze of reed , their lumbered head straining in the wind .
and now , for the first time , he thought that he could smell the north sea , that potent but half-illusory tang evoking nostalgic memory of childhood holiday , of solitary adolescent walk a he struggled with his first poem , of his aunt 's tall figure at his side , binoculars round her neck , striding towards the haunt of her beloved bird .
and here , barring the road , wa the familiar old farm gate still in place .
it continued presence always surprised him since it served no purpose that he could see except symbolically to cut off the headland and to give traveller pause to consider whether they really wanted to continue .
it swung open at his touch but closing it , a always , wa more difficult and he lugged and half lifted it into place and slipped the circle of wire over the gatepost with a familiar sensation of having turned his back on the workaday world and entered country which , no matter how frequent his visit , would always be alien territory .
he wa driving now across the open headland towards the fringe of pine tree which bordered the north sea .
the only house to his left wa the old victorian rectory , a square , red-brick building , incongruous behind it struggling hedge of rhododendron and laurel .
to his right the ground rose gently towards the southern cliff and he could see the dark mouth of a concrete pillbox , undemolished since the war , and a seemingly indestructible a the great hulk of wave-battered concrete , remnant of the old fortification which lay half-submerged in the sand along part of the beach .
to the north the broken arch and stump of the ruined benedictine abbey gleamed golden in the afternoon sun against the crinkled blue of the sea and , breasting a small ridge , he glimpsed for the first time the topsail of larksoken mill and beyond it , against the skyline , the great grey bulk of larksoken nuclear power station .
the road he wa on , veering left , would lead eventually to the station but wa , he knew , seldom used since normal traffic and all heavy vehicle used the new access road to the north .
the headland wa empty and almost bare , the few straggling tree , distorted by the wind , struggled to keep their precarious hold in the uncompromising soil .
and now he wa passing a second and more dilapidated pillbox and it struck him that the whole headland had the desolate look of an old battlefield , the corps long since carted away but the air vibrating still with the gunfire of long-lost battle , while the power station loomed over it like a grandiose modern monument to the unknown dead .
on his previous visit to larksoken he had seen martyr 's cottage spread out beneath him when he and his aunt had stood surveying the headland from the small top room under the cone of the mill .
but he had never been closer to it than the road and now , driving up to it , it struck him again that the description â€˜ cottage â€™ wa hardly appropriate .
it wa a substantial , two-storey , l-shaped house standing to the east of the track with wall partly flint and partly rendered , enclosing at the rear a courtyard of york stone which gave an uninterrupted view over fifty yard of scrub to the grassy dune and the sea .
no one appeared a he drew up and , before lifting his hand to the bell , he paused to read the word of a stone plaque embedded in the flint to the right of the door .
in a cottage on this site lived agnes poley , protestant martyr , burned at ipswich , 15th august 1557 , aged 32 year .
ecclesiastes chapter 3 , verse 15 .
the plaque wa unadorned , the letter deeply carved in an elegant script reminiscent of eric gill , and dalgliesh remembered his aunt telling him that it had been placed there by previous owner in the late twenty , when the cottage wa originally extended .
one of the advantage of a religious education is the ability to identify at least the better-known text of scripture and this wa one which it needed no effort of memory to recall .
a a delinquent nine-year-old at his prep school , he had once been required by the headmaster to write out in his best handwriting the whole of the third chapter of ecclesiastes , old gumboil , economical in this a in all matter , believing that writing line should combine punishment with literary and religious education .
the word , in that round childish script , had remained with him .
it wa , he thought , an interesting choice of text .
that which hath been is now ; and that which is to be hath already been ; and god requireth that which is past .
he rang and there wa only a short delay before alice mair opened the door .
he saw a tall , handsome woman dressed with careful and expensive informality in a black cashmere sweater with a silk scarf at the throat and fawn trouser .
he would have recognized her from her strong resemblance to her brother , although she looked the elder by some year .
she took it for granted that each knew who the other wa , and standing aside to motion him in she said : â€˜ it 's good of you to be so accommodating , mr dalgliesh .
i 'm afraid nora gurney is implacable .
once she knew you were on your way to norfolk you were a predestined victim .
perhaps you would bring the proof through to the kitchen . â€™
it wa a distinguished face with the deep-set , widely spaced eye beneath straight brow , a well-shaped , rather secretive mouth and strong greying hair swept upwards and curled into a chignon .
in her publicity photograph she could , he recalled , look beautiful in a somewhat intimidating , intellectual and very english mould .
but seen face to face , even in the informality of her own house , the absence of a spark of sexuality and , he sensed , a deep-seated reserve , made her seem le feminine and more formidable than he had expected , and she held herself stiffly a if repelling invader of her personal space .
the handshake with which she had greeted him had been cool and firm and her brief smile wa surprisingly attractive .
he knew that he wa oversensitive to the timbre of the human voice and hers , although not jarring or unpleasant , sounded a little forced a if she were deliberately speaking at an unnatural pitch .
he followed her down the hall to the kitchen at the back of the house .
it wa , he judged , almost twenty foot long and obviously served the triple purpose of sitting room , working place and office .
the right-hand half of the room wa a well-equipped kitchen with a large gas stove and an aga , a butcher 's chopping block , a dresser to the right of the door holding an assortment of gleaming pot , and a long working surface with a wooden triangle sheathing her assortment of knife .
in the centre of the room wa a large wooden table holding a stoneware jar of dried flower .
on the left-hand wall wa a working fireplace , the two recess fitted with wall-to-ceiling bookshelf .
to each side of the hearth wa a high-backed wicker armchair in an intricate closely woven design fitted with patchwork cushion .
there wa an open roll-top desk facing one of the wide window and , to it right , a stable door , the top half open , gave a view of the paved courtyard .
dalgliesh could glimpse what wa obviously her herb garden planted in elegant terracotta pot carefully disposed to catch the sun .
the room , which contained nothing superfluous , nothing pretentious , wa both pleasing and extraordinarily comforting and , for a moment , he wondered why .
wa it the faint smell of herb and newly baked dough , the soft ticking of the wall-mounted clock which seemed both to mark the passing second and yet to hold time in thrall , the rhythmic moaning of the sea through the half-open door , the sense of well-fed ease conveyed by the two cushioned armchair , the open hearth ?
or wa it that the kitchen reminded dalgliesh of that rectory kitchen where the lonely only child had found warmth and undemanding , uncensorious companionship , been given hot dripping toast and small forbidden treat ?
he placed the proof on the desk , refused alice mair 's offer of coffee and followed her back to the front door .
she walked out with him to the car and said : â€˜ i wa sorry about your aunt â€” sorry for you , i mean .
i expect that for an ornithologist death cease to be terrible once sight and hearing begin to go .
and to die in one 's sleep without distress to oneself or inconvenience to others is an enviable end .
but you had known her for so long that she must have seemed immortal . â€™
formal condolence , he thought , were never easy to speak or accept and usually sounded either banal or insincere .
hers had been perceptive .
jane dalgliesh had indeed seemed to him immortal .
the very old , he thought , make our past .
once they go it seems for a moment that neither it nor we have any real existence .
he said : â€˜ i do n't think death wa ever terrible to her .
i 'm not sure that i really knew her and i 'm left wishing i 'd tried harder .
but i shall miss her . â€™
alice mair said : â€˜ i did n't know her either .
perhaps i should have tried harder too .
she wa a very private woman , i suspect one of those fortunate people who find no other company more agreeable than their own .
it always seems presumptuous to encroach on that self-sufficiency .
perhaps you share it .
but if you can tolerate company , i 'm having a few people , mostly colleague of alex from the power station , to dinner on thursday night .
would you care to join u ?
seven thirty for eight . â€™
it sounded , he thought , more like a challenge than an invitation .
somewhat to his surprise , dalgliesh found himself accepting .
but then the whole encounter had been a little surprising .
she stood regarding him with a serious intensity a he let in the clutch and turned the car and he had the impression that she wa watching critically to see how he handled it .
but at least , he thought a he gave a final wave , she had n't asked him whether he had come to norfolk to help catch the whistler .
three minute later he raised his foot from the accelerator .
ahead of him , trudging along on the left of the path , wa a little group of child , the eldest girl wheeling a pushchair with two smaller child , one each side of her , clutching the bar .
hearing the noise of the car she turned and he saw a peaked , delicate face framed with red-gold hair .
he recognized the blaney child , met once before with their mother walking along the beach .
obviously the eldest girl had been shopping : the folding pushchair had a shelf under the seat lumped high with plastic bag .
instinctively he slowed down .
they were unlikely to be in real danger , the whistler stalked at night , not in broad daylight , and no vehicle had passed him since he left the coastal road .
but the child looked grossly overburdened and ought not to be so far from home .
though he had never seen their cottage he seemed to remember that his aunt had told him that it lay about two mile to the south .
he recalled what he knew about them , that their father earned a precarious living a a painter whose innocuous , prettified watercolour were sold in cafã©s and tourist shop along the coast and that their mother had been desperately ill with cancer .
he wondered whether mr blaney wa still alive .
his instinct wa to pile the child into the car and drive them home but that , he knew , wa hardly sensible .
almost certainly the eldest child â€” theresa , wa n't it ? â€” had been taught not to accept lift from stranger , particularly men , and he wa virtually a stranger .
on an impulse he reversed the jaguar and drove quickly back to martyr 's cottage .
this time the front door wa open and a swathe of sunlight lay across the red-tiled floor .
alice mair had heard the car and came out to him from the kitchen , wiping her hand .
he said : â€˜ the blaney child are walking home .
theresa is wheeling a pushchair and trying to cope with the twin .
i thought i could offer a lift if i had a woman with me , someone they know . â€™
she said briefly : â€˜ they know me . â€™
without another word she went back into the kitchen then came out to him , closed the front door after her without locking it and got into the car .
putting it into gear , his arm brushed her knee .
he wa aware of an almost imperceptible withdrawing , more emotional than physical , a small delicate gesture of self-containment .
dalgliesh doubted whether that half-imagined recoil had anything to do with him personally , nor did he find her silence disconcerting .
their conversation , when they did speak , wa brief .
he asked : â€˜ is mr blaney still alive ? â€™
â€˜ no .
she died six week ago . â€™
â€˜ how are they managing ? â€™
â€˜ not particularly well , i imagine .
but ryan blaney doe n't welcome interference .
i sympathize .
once he let down his defence half the social worker in norfolk , amateur and professional , will move in on him . â€™
when they drew up beside the little band it wa alice mair who opened the car door and spoke .
â€˜ theresa , here is mr dalgliesh to give you all a lift .
he 's miss dalgliesh 's nephew from larksoken mill .
one of the twin had better sit on my lap .
the rest of you and the pushchair can fit into the back . â€™
theresa looked at dalgliesh without smiling and said a grave thank you .
she reminded him of picture of the young elizabeth tudor , the same red-gold hair framing a curiously adult face both secretive and self-composed , the same sharp nose and wary eye .
the face of the twin , softer edition of her own , turned towards her questioningly then broke into shy smile .
they looked a if they had been dressed in a hurry and not very suitably for a long walk on the headland , even in a warm autumn .
one wore a tattered summer dress in pink spotted cotton with double flounce , the other a pinafore over a checked blouse .
their pathetically thin leg were unprotected .
theresa wa wearing jean and a grubby sweat shirt with a map of london 's underground across the front .
dalgliesh found himself wondering if it had been brought back from a school trip to the capital .
it wa too large for her and the wide sleeve of limp cotton hung from her freckled arm like rag thrown over a stick .
in contrast to his sister , anthony wa over-clad , a bundle of legging , jumper and a padded jacket topped with a woollen helmet with a bobble pulled well down over his forehead , beneath which he surveyed their busyness , unsmiling , like a stout imperious caesar .
dalgliesh got out of the jaguar and tried to extricate him from the pushchair , but the anatomy of the chair momentarily defeated him .
there wa a bar beneath which the child 's rigid leg were obstinately stuck .
the solid uncooperative bundle wa surprisingly heavy ; it wa like trying to manoeuvre a firm and rather smelly poultice .
theresa gave him a brief , pitying smile , dragged the plastic bag from beneath the seat then expertly freed her brother and settled him on her left hip while , with the other hand , she collapsed the pushchair , with a single vigorous shake .
dalgliesh took the baby from her while theresa helped the child into the jaguar and commanded with sudden fierceness , â€˜ sit still . â€™
anthony , recognizing incompetence , grasped dalgliesh 's hair firmly with a sticky hand and he felt the momentary touch of a cheek , so soft that it wa like the fall of a petal .
throughout these manoeuvrings alice mair sat quietly watching from the car but made no move to help .
it wa impossible to know what she wa thinking .
but once the jaguar had moved away she turned to theresa and said in a voice of surprising gentleness : â€˜ doe your father know that you 're out alone ? â€™
â€˜ daddy ha taken the van to mr spark .
it 's due for it mot test .
mr spark doe n't think it 's going to pas .
and i found we 'd run out of milk for anthony .
we have to have milk .
and we wanted some more disposable nappy . â€™
alice mair said : â€˜ i 'm giving a dinner party on thursday evening .
if your father agrees , would you like to come and help with the table like you did last month ? â€™
â€˜ what are you going to cook , miss mair ? â€˜
â€˜ put your head close so that i can whisper .
mr dalgliesh is going to be one of the guest .
i want it to be a surprise . â€˜
the pale golden head leaned forward towards the grey and miss mair whispered .
theresa smiled and then nodded with serious satisfaction in a moment of grave feminine conspiracy .
but next morning ruth awakened early and , leaving miss beard to her gentle dream , dressed quickly and hurried out of the house .
it wa another golden day .
she still retained her english habit of noting each day 's weather , always expecting change , marvelling at the hot sunny day which followed one after the other , almost with monotony .
when she reached the plateau she remained standing , watching for joss barnet , waiting for the moment when she would see him riding towards her .
there wa no longer any need for her to be
â€˜ discovered â€™ .
her sole purpose in being there wa to meet him and she wa content that he should know it .
he wa late this morning .
or wa she earlier than she thought ?
had she misjudged the time ?
no matter .
she wa happy to wait for him , certain that soon she would see him riding towards her .
then a the minute passed and there wa no sign of him , she considered that perhaps he had overslept .
it could happen .
or had his horse gone lame , cast a shoe ?
she sat down and prepared to wait a long a wa necessary .
she knew that in the end he would come .
after a few more minute she became restless , and stood up again , her eye searching the slope of the hillside and the valley below , trying to determine whether some small movement down there wa a man on horseback or merely a trick of her imagination .
should she set off down the hill to meet him ?
but perhaps he would come by another route and then she would miss him .
at the end of what she reckoned must be an hour , she faced the fact that he wa not coming .
she dropped to the ground again and lay down , burying her face in the sweet-smelling grass .
she had been mistaken ever to think that he would come .
she had let her overwhelming desire feed her imagination ; had read something into his word , his look , his action , which had not been there at all .
her face burned with the shame of it .
such wa the feeling joss barnet had aroused in her , that not for one moment did it occur to her to blame him for anything .
it wa all her fault .
sick at heart , she wept .
then she dried her eye on the hem of her petticoat and went slowly back to the house .
â€˜ so you 've decided to put in an appearance ? â€™
cook said .
â€˜ i do seem to recall something about you offering to help me with the party preparation .
but of course if you 've changed your mind â€¦ â€™
â€˜ i have n't , â€™ ruth snapped .
â€˜ i 'm ready to start now .
i do n't want any breakfast . â€™
â€˜ hoity-toity !
what 's the matter with everyone this morning ? â€™
cook demanded .
â€˜ there 's sean o'farrell and the master left in a hurry this hour past for new york city , both without a bite inside them â€” and now you . â€™
â€˜ gone to new york ? â€™
â€˜ that 's what i said . â€™
with mr cranbrook 's word ruth 's appetite immediately returned .
so he had not failed her after all !
how could she have thought that he would ?
something unforeseen and urgent had happened , since sean had obviously known of it yesterday afternoon , and there had been no opportunity for him to inform her .
relief surged through her like a physical infusion of new blood .
â€˜ i 've changed my mind , â€™ she said .
â€˜ i would like some breakfast .
suddenly i 'm hungry .
when will they be back ? â€™
â€˜ sean ?
how should i know ?
i do n't understand business .
what i do understand is that if the master 's not home for the party tomorrow , the mistress wo n't be pleased â€” and that 's putting it mildly .
do n't you dawdle over your breakfast then , not if you intend to make yourself useful .
there 's plenty to be done . â€™
ruth worked all that day a though she had the strength of ten .
they prepared chicken pie , the pastry a light a ruth 's heart , turtle soup , a haunch of venison , jelly , blancmange , syllabub , trifle , and a host of other dish , with still more to be done on the day of the party itself .
mr cranbrook unbent so far a to show approval .
â€˜ you 've done very well , â€™ she conceded .
mr carson , knowing how much wa involved , had excused ruth from all other duty until anna 's bedtime hour .
and now it approached .
she took off the voluminous apron cook had lent her and went in search of her charge .
anna wa in tear .
â€˜ we 're going home , â€™ she sobbed .
â€˜ i do n't want to go back to mr gutermann 's .
i want to stay with edward .
i want to live with him for ever and ever ! â€™
ruth could think of few worse fate , but her stomach lurched at the thought of leaving millfield .
â€˜ how do you know we 're leaving ? â€™ she asked .
â€˜ who told you ? â€™
â€˜ miss fitch , â€™ anna wailed .
â€˜ i do n't like miss fitch .
i hate her !
i daresay she want me to go ! â€™
â€˜ perhaps she 's mistaken , â€™ ruth said , though she doubted if miss fitch wa ever wrong .
â€˜ we 'll ask your mama the moment she come in . â€™
â€˜ i 'm afraid it 's true , â€™ mr carson told them .
â€˜ of course we were only invited for ten day or so . â€™
ruth had lost count of time .
to her , the long summer day had stretched ahead , world without end .
â€˜ we are going to leave on sunday , â€™ mr carson went on .
â€˜ not too early in the day , since i daresay we shall all be tired after tomorrow 's party . â€™
â€˜ anna tell me she never want to leave edward , â€™ ruth said after the child had gone to sleep .
mr carson smiled indulgently .
â€˜ dearest anna !
she 's a little young for a holiday infatuation , but we all have them sooner or later .
thank goodness they never last !
and the more intense they are , the shorter the duration , so anna should soon be over it . â€™
â€˜ will mr barnet be back for the party ? â€™
ruth asked .
â€˜ i expect you mean will o'farrell be back , â€™ mr carson said .
â€˜ and the answer is , i do n't know .
mr barnet tell me that she expects her husband when she see him .
it 's a fact that american men seem to put business before everything .
thank goodness englishman are not like that ! â€™
next morning ruth wa down in the kitchen early , eagerly hoping to find sean there .
he could well have returned late at night and she not heard him , though she had stayed awake for a long time , listening for the sound of the horse , the carriage wheel on the drive .
there wa no sign of sean but mr cranbrook wa already at work .
â€˜ i hope you 're ready to help me , â€™ she said .
â€˜ everybody is busy with this and that â€” a if food wa n't the most important thing ! â€™
â€˜ i 'll help , mr cranbrook , â€™ ruth agreed .
â€˜ they 're not back then ? â€™
she tried to sound nonchalant .
â€˜ not back ?
oh , you mean o'farrell and the master ?
not that i know of .
there 's no telling when they â€˜ u return .
sometimes they 're gone for three or four day at a time . â€™
â€˜ but surely â€¦ with the party ? â€™
mr cranbrook shrugged .
â€˜ he 's a law unto himself , the master .
not for the like of you and me to question why . â€™
the heart had gone out of the day .
ruth fetched and carried and stirred and whipped , praying every moment that joss barnet would return before they left millfield next day .
but when the day had dragged to evening â€” in spite of all there wa to do the time now passed slowly â€” and still there wa no sign of the two men , she began to lose hope .
in the evening , bone-tired , she left the kitchen and went to put a reluctant anna to bed .
then she turned to helping mr carson .
she brushed her mistress 's hair and piled it on top of her head in a cluster of curl , carefully and meticulously arranged to look quite casual .
it wa a style ruth had devised herself and mr carson wa delighted with the result .
â€˜ it look so different , â€™ she said .
â€˜ you really are quite clever at this , ruth .
and now for my dress . â€™
she looked beautiful in the yellow satin , the low-cut bodice tight against her slight figure , the skirt billowing out .
but ruth had no heart either to appreciate or to envy her mistress .
her spirit were at their lowest ebb .
mr carson gave her maid a sharp , compassionate look .
she thought she knew the cause of this mood and in a way she wa glad to see it .
at least it showed that the girl 's mind wa working in the right direction .
â€˜ do n't worry , ruth , â€™ she said kindly .
â€˜ i dare say o'farrell will be back tomorrow before we leave .
and if not , there is always new york when the barnets return in the fall .
and now i sha n't need you again this evening , so apart from looking in on anna from time to time , you may do just a you please . â€™
had she not been so downhearted ruth would have enjoyed herself .
but she had given up all hope of joss barnet returning that evening and nothing else in the world mattered .
the party scene wa pretty enough .
coloured lantern hung in the tree which fringed the lawn and bordered the lake beyond .
torchlight , flaring against the night sky and reflected in the water , had been set up wherever it wa suitable .
already the orchestra had begun to play and the elegantly dressed to appear .
ruth had no heart for it .
she climbed the stair to her room , then undressed and went to bed , wetting the pillow with her tear which , held back all day , now flowed unchecked .
her only comfort wa not to have miss beard in her room , to be able to suffer in solitude .
though she thought sleep would never come , eventually it did .
she fell asleep to the sound of music drifting upwards from the drawing-room .
when she wakened it wa still dark , the orchestra still playing , though it wa not that which had aroused her .
penetrating her sleep she had heard the faint click of the door latch , and then the familiar squeak of the hinge a the door to her room slowly opened .
she raised herself on one elbow , blinking her eye , trying to see in the darkness .
but enough light came from the landing on to which the door opened to silhouette the man standing there .
it wa joss barnet .
shock made her cry out , and he closed the door and moved towards her in quick stride , putting his hand across her mouth to stop-her scream .
then he sat on her bed and , without a word from either of them , she went willingly into his arm and wa held close in his embrace .
she felt his heart beating strong and fast against hers .
they stayed like that for a long moment and then he said , â€˜ light the candle . â€™
â€˜ i ca n't , â€™ she whispered .
â€˜ someone will see the light under the door . â€™
â€˜ no matter if they do , â€™ he said .
â€˜ they will not think of me here .
only my coachman know i am home .
i have not yet joined the party . â€™
â€˜ you came to me first ? â€™
she could hardly believe it .
he would not tell her , this funny bewitching little english girl , that he had come to her first because he could not keep away from her .
she had been on his mind since the morning he had seen her from his horse ; frightened yet defiant , sparking with anger .
almost , but not quite , she had come between him and the work he had had to do in new york city .
the moment the work wa done he had ordered his coachman to drive him back to millfield a fast a the horse would go .
â€˜ light the candle , â€™ he repeated .
ruth 's finger trembled a she obeyed him .
then she lay back on her pillow and they looked at each other a if it wa for the first time .
he traced the contour of her face with gentle finger , outlining the curve of her mouth , stroking her temple .
without any hurry , in spite of the impatience which had brought him here , he caressed the length of her neck and the slope of her shoulder .
from out of nowhere , ruth remembered dick parker : but not , this time , the pleasure of her union with him , only the pain it had brought her on the christmas eve following .
and now although her whole body cried out for fulfilment and she longed for joss barnet to complete what he had surely come to do , she knew that she must not let it happen .
she turned her face away from him , pushed his hand from her .
â€˜ no ! â€™ she cried .
â€˜ you must not ! â€™
he gave not the slightest sign of having heard her , continuing to stroke her neck , and now inserting his finger under the neckline of her nightshift .
she tried again to push him away .
â€˜ please !
please do n't ! â€™ she cried .
it wa surprise which made him stop for a second .
he smiled at her , an unexpectedly tender smile .
â€˜ i wo n't hurt you , â€™ he said .
â€˜ do n't be afraid . â€™
â€˜ i 'm not afraid of being hurt . â€™
â€˜ then what â€¦ ? â€™
â€˜ i 'm afraid of afterwards , â€™ she said hesitantly .
â€˜ if i were to have a child .
it would be the end of the world for me . â€™
â€˜ but you wo n't , â€™ he assured her .
â€˜ i 'll see to that .
i 'm not totally callous . â€™
â€˜ you promise ? â€™
â€˜ i promise . â€™
she lay quiescent and felt his strong finger , quicker now , move to unfasten the button of her shift one by one .
and when he had undone her gown , and had difficulty in lifting it over her head , she raised herself from the pillow and helped him to take it off .
then he pulled down the sheet , which wa all the bedclothes she had needed on that warm night , and she lay naked before him .
she observed him without shame a he looked at every part of her .
her pleasure wa in him , and in his delight of her .
when , at last , he stripped off his clothes and came into her , it wa a if this wa the moment to which all her life had been leading .
he wa a skilful lover : tender and gentle in the beginning , then powerful , persistent , rough almost â€” until , his passion rising in harmony with hers , the climax came like the bursting of a thousand star , like the beginning and ending of the world .
afterwards they lay quietly side by side , not speaking , until he said , â€˜ i must go . â€™
â€˜ not yet , â€™ she begged .
â€˜ you ca n't leave me yet . â€™
she turned over and lay on top of him , trying to pin him down with her own slight weight , and he began to fondle her and she him , and almost at once they were making love again .
â€˜ you are a sorceress , â€™ he told her when it wa all over .
â€˜ an enchantress .
woman a tempting a you should be kept out of the sight of mortal men . â€™
â€˜ you 're not a mortal man , â€™ ruth said .
â€˜ you 're a god ! â€™
he laughed out loud .
â€˜ hush ! â€™ she cautioned .
â€˜ someone will hear you . â€™
â€˜ i 'm a real man all right , â€™ he said .
â€˜ a i 've just proved to you .
and would again if time allowed . â€™
then he stood up and quickly began to dress .
â€˜ i must go and do my duty a a host for what 's left of the night . â€™
â€˜ do n't leave me , â€™ she begged .
â€˜ please stay ! â€™
he looked at her in surprise , spoke brusquely .
â€˜ but of course i must go .
there 's no question . â€™
long afterwards ruth realised that this wa the moment when she had learned that she could never come first with him .
however much he might desire her , she would have no more than the allotted space in his life .
â€˜ when am i going to see you again ? â€™ she asked .
that , also , wa the wrong thing to say .
â€˜ i ca n't make plan , â€™ he said sharply .
â€˜ but we leave tomorrow ! â€™ she exclaimed .
that took him by surprise .
â€˜ the deuce you do !
well i shall see to that .
my wife will extend the invitation to the carson .
i take it they 're not promised elsewhere ? â€™
â€˜ oh no , â€™ ruth said .
â€˜ we 're going back to new york city . â€™
he finished dressing , then came and held her by the shoulder , kissing her lightly on the mouth .
a he wa leaving he turned around and threw a small box on to the bed .
â€˜ from the city , â€™ he said .
â€˜ you see that i had you in my mind ! â€™
he wa out of the room before she could open the box , a dark blue leather affair , lined with white velvet , against which lay a fine gold chain with a small oval locket set around the edge with seed pearl .
she gasped in amazement .
it wa without doubt the most beautiful thing she had ever owned , or ever would .
such delicacy , such refinement !
her finger trembling with excitement , she fastened it around her neck .
it should remain there for ever .
she would never take it off .
ellen and i lingered on in mama sipcott 's for another hour and a half ; indulging in the sailor 's shorebound pastime of planning the perfect voyage .
we decided that masquerade would sail from the bahamas to panama , and thence to the galapagos where we would find darwin 's giant tortoise .
then we would sail south to easter island to explore the mysterious statue before going to the mutineer ' refuge on pitcairn island .
after that we would go to tahiti , and i saw the excitement grow in ellen a she realised that these plan were so close to coming true .
it wa an excitement that matched my own , for i had never sailed the south sea and i had long dreamed of that scatter of tiny , magically named island strewn across one third of a globe .
by the time we had drunk our third bottle of wine ellen and i had long reached new zealand and were already sailing north towards new caledonia .
we were happy .
we caught the bus back to ellen 's apartment and collected her clothes and notebook .
she wa moving back on board wavebreaker in preparation for the next day 's early departure .
i carried her luggage to the yard , noting that even ellen 's strident feminism evaporated in the face of two heavy bag and tropical heat .
once in the boatyard ellen ran ahead of me , evidently eager to reach wavebreaker 's air conditioning .
then , a she reached the dock 's edge , she suddenly checked .
â€˜ what on earth is that ?
oh , no ! â€™
she began to run again .
when i reached the water 's edge i understood her dismay .
a large sports-fishing boat wa moored alongside wavebreaker , but moored so crudely that whoever had brought the powerboat alongside the schooner had not bothered to put out fender , but instead had gouged long ugly gash in wavebreaker 's white paint .
yet even the gash were not so ugly a the expensive boat that had caused them .
there wa nothing wrong with the boat 's line , which were sleekly functional , but her long powerful hull , her upperworks , and even the interior of her capacious working deck had all been painted with a wartime dazzle paint .
the seemingly random and jagged-edged pattern of blue , black , silver , green and white had been designed to disguise a boat 's shape from the prying eye of u-boat captain , so it seemed somewhat fanciful to thus camouflage a pleasure boat in the bahamas .
this boat wa called dream baby , and she wa clearly an expensive infant for rod and whip-aerials and outrigger splayed from her upperworks like the antenna of some outlandish insect .
she boasted a harpoon walkway , a flybridge , and , above the highest wheel-platform , an aluminium canopy which held a radar aerial .
the fighting chair on her aft deck had thick white leather strap giving it the appearance of a padded electric chair , while the dazzle paint gave the boat an oddly military look that wa completed by the number 666 that wa painted on her bow in silver-edged black numeral like those warship use to display their commissioning number .
the boat 's wrap-around windscreen were made of black polarised glass which only added to dream baby 's ugly air of menace .
ellen , unencumbered with luggage , had already reached wavebreaker and taken two plastic fender from a locker .
she swung lithely down to dream baby 's gaudily painted deck and cushioned the two hull .
â€˜ how bad is the damage ? â€™
i called down to her when i reached wavebreaker .
â€˜ it 's scraped back to bare metal ! â€™
â€˜ i 'll give it some paint . â€™
wavebreaker 's hull wa made of steel and , while such hull are marvellously strong and safe , they are soon weakened if their steel is exposed to salt air .
i had to paint the gash a soon a possible so that rust would not begin to bite into wavebreaker 's long sleekness .
ellen looked around the oddly painted powerboat .
â€˜ you 'd think someone rich enough to own a rig like this could afford a pair of fender . â€™
â€˜ who care ?
just cut the damn boat loose , â€™ i said vengefully .
ellen ignored my advice while i , obedient to the rule that if a job needed doing then do it without delay , found a pot of white paint and dug through the locker for a clean brush .
then , from behind me , an unfamiliar voice sounded : â€˜ oh , ring my bell . â€™
it wa a man 's voice ; drawling and lazy .
i twisted around and almost blinded myself by staring straight into the sun , but then , through the dizzying glare , i made out the long silhouette of a tall man who seemed , incongruously , to be dressed in a long , transparent dressing gown .
he wa emerging in stately fashion from wavebreaker 's companionway and , though i could see he wa tall and lanky and had a ponytail of hair , i could make out no detail of his face .
â€˜ who the hell are you ? â€™
i demanded .
the man ignored me , walking instead towards ellen who , dressed only in short and t-shirt , wa climbing long-legged over wavebreaker 's rail .
â€˜ be still my restless heart , â€™ the man had a strong , caressing voice and the slow luscious accent of america 's deep south .
â€˜ dear lady , dear lady , to think that i might have lived my whole life through and never seen you .
oh , lay me down , just lay me down . â€™
ellen , usually so quick with a scornful reply , just stood and stared at the elegant stranger who stopped one pace away from her , took her hand , then bowed above her finger .
he kissed the air a fastidiously polite inch above her knuckle , then closed his eye .
â€˜ dear sweet lord above , i do thank thee for thy kindness in showing me this lovely woman before i died . â€™
to my astonishment and chagrin ellen left her hand in his a he opened his eye and smiled at her .
â€˜ my name , â€™ he stroked her with his voice , â€˜ is jesse isambard sweetman .
and who , dear creature , are you ? â€™
ellen still said nothing .
i had straightened up and moved aside so that the sun no longer dazzled me and i could see sweetman properly , and what i saw i did not like .
his face wa old and young , sardonic and knowing , amused and handsome ; the face of a man who ha seen the world 's wickedness and know how to match it with his own .
his long black hair wa tied into it ponytail with a velvet ribbon , his skin wa parchment pale , and his eye dark .
i put his age at forty , but even among men twenty year younger he would have been accounted handsome , and he knew it , for his expression showed both confidence and amusement a he continued to hold ellen 's hand , and he showed even more amusement when she suddenly realised just what liberty she wa thus granting him and jerked her finger swiftly away .
thus released , jesse sweetman turned to look at me .
the dressing gown had proved to be a long , stylish , ankle-length duster coat which wa loosely woven from a delicate white cotton .
beneath the filmy topcoat he wore a black shirt and black trouser that were tucked into tall black boot .
it wa a dramatic and impractical outfit of a kind i only expected to see on the male model who posed in the more outlandish fashion magazine that our rich client brought aboard wavebreaker , yet jesse isambard sweetman managed to wear the elaborate style with an elegant insouciance .
the only incongruous note wa a cheap round badge , enamelled in red and yellow , that he wore on his shirt , which bore the legend â€˜ just say no ! â€™ .
â€˜ you must be nicholas breakspear , â€™ he said carelessly , a though he did not much care whether i wa or not .
â€˜ is that gaudy piece of junk your boat ? â€™
i gestured to where dream baby 's aerial showed above wavebreaker 's gunwale .
sweetman turned and pretended to notice the sports-fishing boat for the first time .
â€˜ no , â€™ he said helpfully , then bestowed a patronising smile on me .
â€˜ you look so like your father .
it 's really uncanny . â€™
â€˜ did you bring that boat here ? â€™
i persevered .
â€˜ oh , indeed i did , â€™ he said brightly , a though he merely indulged a rather dim child 's curiosity .
â€˜ your mother wa malise fielding , am i right ?
or are you lucy de sill â€™ son ? â€™
â€˜ why the hell did n't you use fender when you tied alongside ? â€™
he sighed , intimating what a bore i wa being .
â€˜ i did not use fender , breakspear , because i despise precaution .
precaution are the symptom of small and fearful mind .
precaution will not conquer empire , they will not build great city , they will not transmute dream into gold or carry men across wide ocean , and precaution will not , emphatically not , win fair lady , â€™ and here he turned to ellen and lasciviously dropped his gaze to her long bare leg .
ellen twisted away and sweetman laughed at her obvious discomfiture , then , a coolly a though he owned wavebreaker , he stepped down into the central cockpit where he first brushed at , then sat on , one of the white cushioned seat by the ship 's wheel .
â€˜ i 've had a look round the boat , â€™ he said very coolly , â€˜ and i approve of her .
so tell me the cost of a week 's charter . â€™
â€˜ the man you want to see , â€™ i said , â€˜ is called matthew mcillvanney and his office is the pink building with the outside staircase .
he 's not here this afternoon , but you can doubtless telephone him next week . â€™
sweetman took a pair of polarised sunglass from his shirt pocket and put them on before inspecting me again .
he did not seem to like what he saw .
â€˜ you 're really not being noticeably helpful , â€™ he said after a pause , â€˜ so let u try again shall we ?
would you please tell me the high season price for one week ? â€™
â€˜ how many passenger ? â€™
ellen asked before i could refuse to answer .
sweetman paused again , this time to light a long pale blue cigarette with a slim gold lighter .
he shrugged .
â€˜ two , four , six passenger ?
doe it really matter ? â€™
â€˜ one week in high season cost ten thousand u dollar for two people , and every extra couple is another thousand buck . â€™
ellen 's voice wa cold , a though she disliked satisfying his curiosity .
â€˜ and to those price you have to add the boat 's running cost . â€™
â€˜ which are ? â€™
sweetman asked carelessly .
â€˜ a lot . â€™
ellen said flatly .
â€˜ you 're talking fuel , food and liquor , plus any toy you might want aboard like scuba equipment , snorkel , jet-skis or sailboards . â€™
sweetman drew on his fancy cigarette , then blew a plume of smoke into wavebreaker 's rigging before smiling lazily at ellen .
â€˜ and tell me , sweet creature , do you count a a toy ?
or are you a part of the initial ten thousand dollar ? â€™
â€˜ get off the boat , â€™ i said .
â€˜ shut up . â€™
he turned on me like a snake .
â€˜ you 're nothing but a hired hand , breakspear , so shut the fuck up . â€™
he glanced at the paint pot and brush that i wa still holding .
â€˜ go and paint something .
be useful . â€™
he stared into my eye , challenging me to defy him , and when i did not move he looked back to ellen .
â€˜ i asked you a question , dear heart .
please be so good a to answer . â€™
â€˜ get off this boat , â€™ i told him , but my anger only amused sweetman who unfolded his long thin leg from the cushioned thwart .
â€˜ dick off , â€™ he said to me .
i wa surprised that he so eagerly sought to confront me .
i am not a small man , nor am i a weakling , yet the thin sweetman seemed unconcerned a i jumped down into the cockpit .
then i saw why he wa so confident .
he put a hand into a pocket of his elegant duster coat and brought out a small .22 pistol that he pointed at my face .
â€˜ a lady â€™ gun , â€™ he said , â€˜ but remarkably effective at close range . â€™
â€˜ nick ! â€™
ellen called warningly , a though i might not have seen the gun .
the gun 's threat had not stopped my advance .
i wa calling sweetman 's bluff , confident he would not dare pull the trigger , and equally confident that my marine training would let me turn him into mincemeat .
i wa also half drunk , and thus filled with the dutch courage offered by mama sipcott 's worst white wine .
sweetman stood .
there wa , at last , a look of alarm on his face , and i could see him wondering whether he really would have to pull the small trigger .
he held the gun pointed at my eye .
the picture , very like the one rufus fletcher had taken in the summer of 1976 , occupied the screen for about fifteen second .
the whole item wa allowed no more than four time that in the bbc 's sunday evening news broadcast at 6.30 .
the other forty-five second were taken up by a policeman talking to a reporter about having nothing to say except that there would be an inquest .
but shiva and lili manjusri saw the picture and so did rufus fletcher .
adam verne-smith , unwinding in puerto de la cruz , did not of course see it .
he did not even see an english newspaper .
they were expensive to buy and came a day late .
he did not want to be reminded of home and the only paper he even glanced at wa the international herald tribune , a copy of which anne found on the beach .
his father , at home in edgware , said to his wife :
â€˜ good god , wyvis hall , a i live and breathe . â€™
beryl verne-smith peered , but the picture immediately vanished .
â€˜ yes , i suppose it wa . â€™
the policeman talked , the reporter trying to jog him into revelation and failing .
in the background , autumnal tree could be seen and a church on the summit of a low hill .
lewis verne-smith sat shaking his head , le a a gesture of denial than of a generalized despair at the state of the world .
it wa not that unpleasant memory were evoked , for these were always with him , his existence wa inseparable from that old bitterness , but that a sight of the house , even the glimpse of a photograph , revived the precise feeling he had had â€” why , it must be getting on for eleven year ago .
â€˜ ten and a half , â€™ said his wife .
â€˜ i shall have to get in touch with the police .
no two way about it , i shall have to get in touch with them . â€™
â€˜ not this evening , surely ? â€™ said beryl , who wanted to watch mastermind .
lewis said nothing .
the room in which they were sitting underwent the curious shrinking process to which it wa subject whenever he wa reminded of wyvis hall or his uncle hilbert or even if the county of suffolk were mentioned .
suddenly it grew small and poky .
the brick side-wall of his neighbour 's house seemed to have moved itself four or five foot further towards the dividing fence , so that it loomed offensively .
lewis got up and pulled the curtain across with a pettish jerk of his hand .
â€˜ should n't you wait until adam get back ? â€™
beryl said .
â€˜ why ?
what would that be in aid of ? â€™
beryl meant that adam had been among the previous owner of wyvis hall while her husband had not , but she knew better than to point this out .
â€˜ there is no one living know that lovely place better than 1 . â€™
â€˜ that 's true . â€™
â€˜ i sha n't wait till adam return , â€™ lewis said in that manner that had once led his daughter to call him the frog footman ,
â€˜ but i shall wait until tomorrow . â€™
men and woman do not usually put their baser feeling and intention into word , not even in the deep recess of their own mind .
so lewis did not say , even to himself , when he wa privately considering trying to get hold of his son in tenerife , that he disliked adam and would have been pleased to spoil his holiday .
instead , he rationalized his thought and justified himself adam probably â€” indeed , almost certainly â€” knew nothing about the find in the pine wood , but adam had once owned the house and had thus taken on a responsibility .
he could not shed that responsibility just because he had sold the place .
lewis would have agreed with oscar wilde that our past is what we are .
we can not rid ourselves of it .
therefore it wa adam 's duty to come home and face the music , even though this might be no more than a short blast on a tin whistle .
but he had no precise idea where adam wa and he did not think adam 's travel agent ( a personal friend of the young verne-smiths ) would tell him .
some excuse would be made for not telling him .
lewis 's bark , anyway , wa always worse than his bite .
he had virtually no bite , a he had once overheard adam say to bridget , and heard it with helpless chagrin .
â€˜ a bloody good thing or our childhood would have been a misery instead of just a bore . â€™
lewis walked into his local police station in edgware on monday morning .
they seemed surprised to see him but not astonished .
the suffolk police had begun hunting up previous owner of wyvis hall and they had been alerted that a verne-smith lived in their area .
there were , after all , only two in the london phone directory .
this might be a bonus .
he wa asked to wait and then shown into a room where a detective sergeant prepared to take a statement from him .
with busy pomposity lewis dictated it to a typist and would have gone on and on had he not been diplomatically restrained .
â€˜ wyvis hall , nunes , suffolk , and the twenty acre of land surrounding it were the property , through his marriage , of my uncle , hilbert verne-smith .
they came into the possession of my son hilbert john adam verne-smith under my uncle 's will , bypassing myself , though my son wa no more than nineteen at the time of my uncle 's death .
being an undergraduate at the time , my son naturally never considered actually residing in the house .
he wa in agreement with my suggestion that the property be sold and before he returned to college in the autumn of 1976 , he took my advice and placed house and land in the hand of an estate agent .
â€˜ country property were not selling well at the time .
â£45,000 wa the asking price and i wa not surprised that the sale , so to speak , hung fire .
however , in the spring of 1977 an offer wa made , which my son accepted .
this sale later fell through and it wa not until the following august that wyvis hall wa finally sold to a mr and mr langan for the much improved figure of â£51,995 .
â€˜ a far a i know , my son 's personal acquaintance with wyvis hall wa confined to my uncle 's lifetime when 1 , my wife and son and daughter frequently stayed with him .
after my uncle 's death in april 1976 he visited wyvis hall on perhaps two , or at the most three , separate occasion simply for the purpose of looking it over and reaching a decision about the disposal of furniture and effect .
â€˜ i suppose it is possible that squatter or other vagrant took possession of the house between the time of my uncle 's death and the sale of the property .
certainly my son never let it or allowed anyone to occupy it on either a temporary or permanent basis .
â€˜ my son is at present on holiday in tenerife with his wife and daughter .
i can not say precisely when i expect him to return , though i should suppose in about a week from now . â€™
it wa all very small and quiet and low-key .
the snippet in rufus 's monday morning newspaper measured just an inch in depth .
it answered the question he had asked himself and told him that the bone of a very young child had been found a well a those of a young woman.
this wa not a shock .
how could it be otherwise , since this wa wyvis hall and the pine wood and the animal cemetery ?
to photograph the house for the news last night the cameraman must have stood just where he had stood himself , on the edge of the lawn with his back to the cedar tree .
a popular .
mass-produced camera he had used , but quite a good one .
one thing about zosie 's pilfering , she never stole rubbish .
he had taken a picture of her after that and one of the animal cemetery .
â€˜ why is the grass always so short up here ? â€™
adam had asked .
â€˜ rabbit , i expect . â€™
â€˜ why ca n't bloody rabbit come and eat my lawn ? â€™
adam always referred to â€˜ my lawn â€™ , â€˜ my house â€™ , â€˜ my furniture â€™ .
it had got up rufus 's nose a bit , though adam had a perfect right to do this .
it wa his , all of it , and it went to his head rather .
nineteen-year-olds seldom inherit country mansion , after all .
it must have been some time in august when i took those picture , rufus thought , and a couple of week later it wa all over .
coincidentally , a the community and their life together broke up , so did the weather .
it wa raining intermittently all the time they were in the cemetery , the pine bowing and shivering in the wind .
sometimes they had had to stop and take shelter under the closely planted-trees .
if the weather had held and still been hot and dry would they have dug deeper ?
probably not .
in spite of the rain , the earth wa still a hard a iron .
a sheet of rain had come down then , a hard , gusty shower , while they were laying the square of turf back in place , and adam had said something about the rain making the grass grow quickly , the rain being on their side .
â€˜ we should all go our separate way a soon a we can , â€™ rufus had said .
â€˜ we should pack up now and go . â€™
the spade and the fork they had hung up among the other tool in the stable .
they had packed and adam had locked up the house .
at some point rufus himself had taken the thing out of the fridge and left the door open to defrost it .
adam closed the front door and stood there for a moment a if he could not wrench himself away .
so much of it beauty had been stripped from it by the whipping wind .
and by the neglect of the long hot summer .
a sudden gust of rain dashed against the red brick that were already stained in patch by water .
the house that when he first saw it had seemed to float on a raft of golden mist , now lay in a wilderness , amidst ragged grass and straggling bush and tree dead from the heat .
dirty grey cloud tumbled across the sky above the slate roof , now the only thing that shone , glazed with rain .
but rufus admitted to himself that the beauty of nature and architecture had never meant much to him .
it wa the heat and sunshine and privacy he liked .
and now he longed only to get away .
they all got into goblander and he drove away up the drift , adam next to him , the others in the back .
the drift had become a tunnel of overgrowth that dripped water on to the roof of the van .
none of them allowed their eye to turn towards the pine wood .
at the top they came out into uncompromising , bright grey light , the bleak , hedgeless lane , the flat meadow where here and there stunted tree squatted like old men in cloak .
adam 's simile , not his , thought rufus with a grimace .
no one asked where he wa taking them .
no one spoke .
adam had hilbert 's old golf-bag stuck between his leg and rufus guessed the gun wa inside it .
they must have gone a good two mile before they met another car .
rufus overtook a bus going to colchester and dropped the two in the back so that they could catch it .
he took adam on to sudbury for him to catch a train there and at that point they parted .
adam got down from goblander and said ,
â€˜ for ever and for ever , farewell , rufus . â€™
which wa probably a quotation from something , though rufus did not know what and thought fastidiously that it wa in bad taste , histrionic , though just like adam .
â€˜ take care , â€™ said rufus , and not looking back any more than he had done when they returned from the cemetery , drove off round the town he had got to know so well , over the stour bridge , into essex , heading for halstead and dunmow and ongar and london .
he never had seen any of them again .
there had been no need to pretend , to turn aside .
briefly , starting his fifth year in medical school something over thirteen month later , he had wondered if shiva manjusri would be one of the incoming freshman .
but no , his intuition had been accurate .
at any rate shiva 's face wa not among the several brown face .
a for the others , avoiding them had presented no problem .
would they get in touch with him now ?
no contingency plan had been made for this eventuality .
so long a there wa no hunt for a missing girl they had felt themselves reasonably safe .
their mind had not reached out to the terror of what had in fact happened .
none of them had been the kind of people who could have imagined devotion to a pet animal or according to it funerary rite .
it wa shiva who had proposed the site .
they had congratulated him on his ingenuity .
ten year â€¦
an ovarian cyst , nothing to get upset about , rufus told m beauchamp .
she wa thirty-two , an editor with a distinguished publishing house , married to an investigative journalist .
a yet they had no child , but she wanted four , she told rufus .
â€˜ no reason why you should n't . â€™
he had another glance at her note .
â€˜ in fact , a peculiarity about this condition is that it seldom if ever occurs in a woman who 's had a baby . â€™
â€˜ my god , â€™ she said , putting her coat on , .
'and there wa 1 , making my husband 's life a misery , sure i 'd got the dreaded c. â€™
they all thought they 'd got the dreaded c , poor thing .
you could n't blame them .
rufus took her â£40 off her by the reception desk , having set in train the arrangement by which she would be admitted to a fashionable west end clinic , with rufus , her surgery and her hospitalization ultimately paid for by some provident association to which she and her husband subscribed .
rufus shook hand .
he walked back to his consulting room , dying for a cigarette .
this wa unlike him .
he could usually get through quite easily until after lunch .
he thought , i know what my idea of heaven would be , if by heaven we mean a place of bliss in which to pas eternity : a sanctuary where one might chain-smoke without impairment of breathing , destruction of the lung or damage to the heart , light each fresh cigarette from the glowing butt of it predecessor , and drink ice-free but hundred-proof chilled vodka laced with two drop of angostura and a gill of newly opened perrier endlessly , with increasing euphoria until a peak of joy and ease wa reached but without any sub-sequent nausea or pain or dehydration or oblivion â€¦
sitting alone , he lit his cigarette , the first of the day , and there came that faint swimming in the head , a tautening of the gut .
he closed his eye .
if it come to light that i wa in that house with adam and the others , he thought with cold clarity , if someone tell the paper , or the police and thence the paper , that i wa there during the summer of 1976 , living there , it will be all up with me .
i will lose my practice and my reputation and everything that i have and can look forward to , if not my liberty .
and without the rest i sha n't care about my liberty .
it would be bad enough if i were a g p or an expert in some other branch of medicine , an orthopaedic surgeon , for instance , or an ear , nose and throat man , but i am a gynaecologist , and it is the bone of a young woman and a baby that have been found there â€¦
what worried woman would come to me ?
what mr strawson or m beauchamp ?
what gp would send her to me ?
if i were innocent , thought rufus , i know very well what i would do .
i would pick up the phone and phone my solicitor and ask to come and see him and get his advice .
he might advise me to make a statement to the police which i should of course do under his guidance .
but i shall not do this because i am not innocent .
i shall sit here and wait and sweat it out and look the fact in the face , trying to anticipate the worst that can happen .
the wonderful thing about the human mind , adam thought , is the way it cope when the worst happens .
beyond that worst happening you think there can be nothing , the unimaginable ha taken place , and on the other side is death , destruction , the end .
but the worst happens and you reel from it , you stagger , the shock is enormous , and then you begin to recover .
you rally , you stand up and face it .
you get used to it .
an hour maybe and you are making contingency plan .
for what had happened wa not the worst , you realized that .
the worst wa yet to come , wa perhaps always yet to come , never would actually come , because if it did you would know it , that would be reality , and there would be nothing then but to kill yourself .
quickly .
now that he wa able to , he assembled what had happened and laid the fact before himself .
they had dug up those bone at wyvis hall and had decided it wa murder they were investigating .
bone , skeleton , body , do not bury themselves .
those were the fact , a far a he knew them up to this moment .
he would know more , much more , in the day to come .
what wa certain wa that he could no longer use the escape key .
it wa defunct .
the passage it cancelled had , in any case , a in certain programme , not been lost but stored on some limbo disc from whence they must now be retrieved .
adam sat in his parent ' house , drinking tea .
there must be a total retrieval now , the one good thing about which wa that it might banish his dream .
he wa aware of a slight feeling of sickness and of cold , an absence of hunger , though he had been feeling quite hungry when he got off the plane .
anne sat next to him on his mother 's cretonne-covered settee and abigail lay on a plaid rug on the floor , kicking with her leg and punching with her arm .
his mother kept poking toy which she did not want at her .
a passage from a novel by john o'hara came back to adam .
he had memorized it year ago in the ecalpemos epoch : â€˜ the safest way to live is first , inherit money , second , be born without taste for liquor , third , have a legitimate job that keep you busy , fourth , marry a wife who will cooperate in your sexual peculiarity , fifth , join some big church , sixth , do n't live too long . â€™
apart from the last one which he had n't got to yet and the penultimate one which seemed to apply in america more than here ( here he had joined the golf club ) he had complied with all the rest .
or his nature and luck had complied for him .
nemesis had still come down like the wolf on the fold .
he had not wanted to come back here .
but there had been no spirit in him , the shock of what his father told him had been too great .
â€˜ something that will interest you , adam , something to make you sit up .
they 've dug up a lot of human bone at my old uncle 's house â€¦ â€˜
by the time he had rallied and got himself together and wa thinking of thing to say to the police it wa too late and they were heading north .
anne wa furious .
when lewis said to come back with him and eat there adam had got a kick on the ankle from anne and another kick when he had n't replied .
he had turned on her and said with cold savagery , â€˜ for fuck 's sake , stop kicking me , will you ? â€™
he expected his father to rise and say something about that being no way to speak to one 's wife or not in front of the child , he wa capable of that .
but he had said nothing , only looked subdued , and adam realized why .
his own terrible fear and anger had communicated itself to his father and shown him what the better part of valour wa : keeping silent .
having put the cat among the pigeon , made mischief in his special way , he wa lying low now and waiting .
the old bastard .
adam only wished uncle hilbert had left him wyvis hall and then there would have been no ecalpemos , no zosie , and no death .
and adam could n't see he would have been much worse off .
he and anne would be living in a house like this one , rather than that neo-georgian palace .
child , after all , he thought , looking at abigail , were happy wherever they were , so long a they were loved â€¦
his parent had not asked him what sort of holiday he had had or how the flight had been .
the conversation wa exclusively on the subject of the discovery at wyvis hall .
adam did not know whether to be glad or sorry he had not obtained an english newspaper while away .
if he had done the shock would have been le but on the other hand , his holiday would have been spoilt .
he would have liked very much to be alone .
of course he knew there wa no possibility of this , now or when he returned home , for when you were married you never could be alone .
presumably that wa the point .
what wa he going to tell anne ?
how much wa he going to tell her ?
he did n't know .
none of it , if he could help it .
they sat at the table in the dining area to eat an absurdly early high tea .
lewis asked him if he could remember the day when he heard he had inherited wyvis hall and had walked in here and astounded them with his news .
â€˜ he had a beard then , anne . â€™
lewis 's subdued air had changed to one of high good humour .
â€˜ you would n't have recognized him , he looked like john the baptist . â€™
adam could remember very well but he wa n't going to say so .
â€˜ what a funny thing , â€™ said lewis .
â€˜ we had ham salad that day too .
what a coincidence !
oh , yes , i 've been meaning to ask you , who wa it looked after wyvis hall while you were in greece ? â€™
adam could eat nothing .
the other time , he remembered , it wa his father who had n't been able to eat .
he did n't know what lewis meant about someone looking after the house but no doubt he , adam , had at the time concocted some tale to keep his father quiet , to keep him away even .
â€˜ someone from the village , you said , â€™ lewis persisted .
â€˜ how can i remember that far back ? â€™
â€˜ the police will want to know .
it may be of vital importance . â€™
â€˜ are n't you going to eat your meat , dear ? â€™ said beryl .
abigail , who had been put upstairs in one of the bedroom to sleep , set up a wailing sound .
adam wa on his foot at once .
â€˜ i think we should go . â€™
they had to wait until his father wa ready .
adam would have preferred to phone for a hire car but lewis would n't hear of it .
anne sat in the front in the passenger seat while adam wa in the back with abigail .
if his father could have found out what flight they were coming on , the police certainly could .
it wa possible they might be waiting for him .
they would wish to interview every former owner or occupant of wyvis hall .
he looked again at the newspaper account of the adjourned inquest that his father had saved for him .
it would be owner and occupant of wyvis hall between nine and twelve year before that they would wish to interview , and those were great-uncle hilbert , who wa dead , himself and ivan langan to whom he had sold the house .
a for other occupant , how would they know who else had lived there ?
it wa ironical that ten day before he had seen shiva at heathrow .
the encounter he now saw a an omen , a shadow cast by a coming event .
what would that event be ?
adam did not want at this point to speculate , it made hiâ€“ feel sick .
he turned the newspaper over so that he could not see that headline and those paragraph .
in high spirit , his father wa talking about the immense advance made in forensic science in recent year .
a soon a they got home , anne started getting abigail to bed .
their case humped upstairs and put into the bedroom , adam looked rufus fletcher up in the phone book .
he wa in there twice , at a wimpole street number and again at an address in mill hill : rufus h. fletcher , mb , mrcp .
all these year then , or for some of them , rufus had been living three or four mile from him .
he could n't look shiva up because he could n't remember his surname .
woman marry and change their name , he thought , there wa no point in pursuing that one .
of course he could look up robin tatian but where , really , would that get him ?
he wa reaching-for the blue directory when anne came back with abigail in her arm , so adam took her and carried her back to bed himself and tucked her in and kissed her .
she wa almost asleep .
he wondered if rufus had child and if so did he worry about them coming to terrible harm the way adam worried ?
wa his whole life affected by what had happened at ecalpemos ?
adam might have escaped the file memory for year , suppressed them and jerked violently away from them , but he had never been able to pretend he wa unscathed by those event .
sometimes he felt that he wa the person he wa because of them and acted the way he did because of their effect .
he sat by abigail 's cot , not wanting to remember , but knowing that now he must .
there wa nothing in his house to remind him of ecalpemos .
everything that wa left , everything he and rufus had n't sold , had gone to ivan langan with the house .
for a song , too , because he had not been able to bear the thought of going back , meeting a valuer , walking about the house , picking thing off shelf and out of cupboard .
only once had he returned after they all left and that had been bad enough , like a dream â€” no , like stepping into the set and scenario of some frightening film , a hitchcock movie perhaps .
he asked the taxi he had taken to put him down at the top of the drift and he had walked to the house .
it wa almost a year since he had been there and in that time nothing had been done , nothing had been touched .
from the pine wood he simply averted his eye â€” till later .
the drift wa thickly overgrown , a dank tunnel out of whose bushy side the tendril of bramble and briar rose caught at his clothes .
one of these whipped back at him and a he caught at it a thorn drove into the fleshy pad of his finger .
that thorn had been there , festering , for month .
a dull cool summer it had been , a different a could be from the year before .
no golden light bathed the red brick of the house .
it no longer looked mellow .
beautiful , yes , but severe somehow and , to adam 's heightened awareness , reproachful .
he found himself encouraging , fostering , the scenario illusion .
only thus , only by pretending unreality , pretending this wa a part he acted , could he go on , cross the wild , shaggy grass , go past the black-branched cedar tree , arrive at the porch set in it four doric column and insert his key in the lock .
conclusion
task analysis ha not and can not be reduced to a set of standardised procedure which the aspiring analyst could acquire in a formal training course .
the technique just described are no more than guideline in what remains the creative art of studying and describing what an experienced worker is doing or will be required to do .
the danger in being too rigid is that justice will not be done to the flexibility and complexity of human performance .
the danger of being too flexible is that the ergonomists will have an inadequate basis from which to design interface , training course and other operator aid .
if a comprehensive task description can be completed then it is legitimate to enquire why the task can not be allocated to a technical device rather than a human being .
yet without a reasonably comprehensive task description the total system performance may be unreliable or unpredictable .
there is a necessary compromise which can only be arrived at in the context of a particular system .
a mentioned earlier there are always the twin problem of how to get the information and how to present it .
it is sometimes easier to proceed on the basis of : â€˜ if i were doing the job this is how i would do it â€™ , but this can be delusory even for analyst who have past experience a operator .
for analyst who are designer creating a new task there may be no alternative , but any task description arrived at by this method should be checked against the behaviour of real operator a they gain experience .
a particular difficulty about task synthesis is that there is no easy way of confirming completeness .
a task description which is part of a design process should be fully â€” documented in term of the origin of information , the assumption made and the method used .
the standard method of producing task description is to write all the separate sub-tasks at various level on card and then assemble the card in a network .
there is a temptation to make these final diagram very large , but often it is more useful to separate into small unit with cross-referencing .
the optimum size seems to be a3 , this is easily copied and circulated but is large enough to contain considerable detail .
the procedure can be computerised , there are programme available for the easy production , manipulation and storage of block diagram with useful cross-referencing facility .
there is an inherent difficulty in that often the main dividend from a task analysis is from the act of obtaining it .
those not involved find it difficult to gain very much from a presentation of a task description .
like reference book , they have to be used rather than read .
task analysis can be very expensive in skilled manpower , but in looking at cost/value it is important to include in value the increase in mutual understanding which occurs when a multi-disciplinary team conduct the analysis .
if such a team is used the required man-hours can be optimised by using the delphi method rather than a long series of group meeting .
political , economic and social issue which arise in conducting task analysis are discussed in the context of job analysis ( p. 148 ) .
application
man-power planning
the â€˜ human resource â€™ concept of man-power a the central profitâ­m_generating asset of any organisation ha made some progress over the past twenty year .
there wa particular interest around 1970 when company were prosperous , stable and innovative ( ipm , 1972 , patten , 1971 ) .
the objective is to revise and almost reverse the traditional accountancy concept of man-power a a resource consuming factor requiring regular payment , overhead in the form of heated , lighted , equipped workspace and so on .
from the narrow accountancy viewpoint , people are a cost and it is desirable to keep this cost a low a possible .
in these term it is very difficult to justify , for example , sending a member of staff on a training course .
the training requires expenditure and so also doe the replacement for the person away .
where is the return ?
the return is actually in the improved human resource but this is not readily measurable in term which accountant use .
there have been two attempt to reduce human resource to this form of measurement ( giles and robinson , 1972 ) .
one is to acquire a human asset multiplier for each level of staff .
the multiplier for manual staff might be unity but it increase with staff level and becomes three or more for management .
the other is to add together all the personnel cost for each kind of worker from the original job advertisement through to the retirement or redundancy payment .
the first doe attempt to obtain a value , the second remains essentially a cost and not a value .
it would be unduly optimistic to assume that management skill have risen to a level such that cost undertaken can be assumed to be equivalent to value .
a le direct measure which is applicable only to the most senior management is to observe the fall or rise of the share price when a particular executive leaf or join a company .
this can be very high , for a large company a change in market value of million of pound is not unusual .
the most serious consequence of the accountancy view of man-power is that high level policy decision-making doe not give this factor sufficient weight .
for example , the main board of a company will have complete detail of cost and value of physical resource such a building and equipment but relatively scanty data about the man-power which is their most important asset .
indeed it will be described almost entirely a a liability because the cost will be known .
similarly , broad factor such a the state of morale will again only be described by negative feature such a absenteeism , stoppage , strike , low quality output and so on .
it is obvious that company output and project must reflect the man-power and it performance level , but , if this is acknowledged at all , it is only in brief verbal term within , for example , the chairman 's annual report .
the obsession , of current management , with measurement and the reduction of every variable to number for ease of computer manipulation ha worsened the situation .
unfortunately there is no easy remedy .
human resource are too complex a variable to be easily susceptible to measurement beyond the level of counting head and trade .
key variable such a the quality of staff at any level and the current morale are only expressible in general verbal descriptive term .
it is generally accepted ( p. 145 ) that â€˜ hygiene â€™ type variable such a pay and working condition can , if they are inappropriately specified , depress morale and motivation but they will not in themselves result in very high level of these parameter .
morale and motivation are influenced more by condition of work in the sense of work variety opportunity and attitude of management .
these factor are worthy of emphasis because in practice they are still dealt with very badly in many organisation and yet it take little trouble or expertise to make an enormous difference .
for example , very few senior management take the trouble to keep worker fully informed about policy and likely change .
the result is excessive reliance on rumour and continuous speculation which is not only time-consuming but is also highly deleterious in morale term .
the two human factor which can be unambiguously measured are age and sex .
the age distribution of a work force is always an interesting and important source of information .
for most purpose a rectangular distribution is the most desirable because it provides the appropriate mix of youthful enthusiasm and ageing experience .
it also make for regular change a staff retire and are replaced .
many distribution show a peak in a particular age group mainly associated with taking on a large number of young people when the organisation wa started or reorganised , this is not desirable because it lead to excessive competition for promotion at particular stage .
these comment are obviously most relevant for work force where there is little tendency to move out , this is characteristic of a surprisingly large number of organisation in european country and in japan but much le so in the u.s.a.
stable work force have their advantage in term of familiarity with the enterprise and it peculiar need but they do result in problem if the market for the product is erratic or otherwise unpredictable .
this is particularly so in high technology e.g. design and construction of ship , aircraft , power station and chemical plant , where the product unit is large and expensive and the variety of required expertise is extensive .
some peak of demand can be dealt with by using consultant , but they tend to be expensive and do not always fit well with ill-defined but important factor such a the favoured style of the organisation .
in well ordered system it may be possible to calculate the length of in-house experience required to achieve the required level of expertise in particular topic and compare this with the lead time for particular product requirement .
given time available to train new staff it is not necessary to keep more than a nucleus in that particular expertise .
on the other hand , if there is usually insufficient notice of need it may be necessary to keep staff who have period with little to do between project .
it is also desirable to have the possibility of shifting staff between design and operational duty .
this not only provides flexibility in the use of man-power , it also improves communication .
these real difficulty of man-power utilisation are such a to force many organisation to become larger and larger if they are to remain economic .
size provides a cushion to the vicissitude of market but it creates other problem .
for example , difficulty of communication and in particular , how to inculcate the feeling within each individual that he and his performance are important to the organisation .
this is considered in more detail in chapter 3 .
human resource should be fundamental to subject such a ergonomics which are essentially people-centred but the concept remains procedurally undeveloped at any level from a continent through country , region and company down to particular working system .
this is one reason why policy maker never seem to take account fully of the people affected by their decision .
the design of procedure
the increased importance of standardised informational support for both machine and operator ha led to the concept of procedure a a separate design issue within a system ( fig. 1.30 ) .
much of this information can be incorporated in computer program but there is also a need for extensive printed paper for the use of the operator .
this take three main form : checklist , routine and knowledge-texts .
the terminology in this field is not standardised .
software might be restricted , a in this book , to computer program but it is sometimes used a the generic term to include all source of information .
procedure is sometimes used for what are here called routine and sometimes to indicate all the operator 's information support except software .
the situation is further confused when some but not all the operator information support is itself computer-based .
sometimes the term firm-ware is used .
however whatever the terminology used there is a requirement for design effort .
the quality of procedure would be much improved if designer followed some simple guide-lines ( table 1.16 ) .
many document are written on the implicit assumption that the reader is much like the writer in term of expertise and style of thinking .
similarly it is assumed that the condition under which the reading will take place are the same a those of writing which are usually a clean well-lit office .
they may have to be read in the open air , in rain and darkness or within a plant under oily , cramped , poorly lit condition .
the user probably ha limited expertise and he may be working under various stress condition .
the material on which the information is printed , the typeface used , the sequence , the structure and the format generally should reflect the condition of use , ( easterby and zwaga , 1984 ) .
all these thing can be achieved if it is acknowledged that all procedure should a validated by user under the normal condition of use .
checklist
checklist are used in the pre-start mode , for routine maintenance and for fault-finding .
they normally take the form of a series of question or statement which the operator us to guide and structure his inspection of the hardware and other system component .
the sequence is dictated by the optimal order in which action should be taken , for example in starting up an aircraft .
there are many situation when the order is of no great consequence , for example a safety audit of a new machine , and in this latter case some logical structure is needed .
a mentioned above , the logic of the design may not be the optimal basis if the way the operator think and act is different .
baker ( 1984 ) suggests that four kind of shortcoming emerge when checklist are validated in the real situation .
the operator may deviate from the listed procedure because it may require excessive moving about or because he is interrupted by the requirement of other task .
systematic use of a checklist often reveals fault in work design such a inadequate access , visibility and labelling .
the checklist itself may be inconsistent , incomplete , imprecise or ambiguous .
finally the checklist may have reprographic limitation such a inadequate vertical or horizontal structure , poor typeface and insufficient linking of requirement , description , remark and tick-off point .
the international ergonomics association developed a general ergonomics checklist which is reproduced in edholm ( 1967 ) .
there is a deceptive simplicity about such list which requires extensive effort to ensure a comprehensive but coherent content .
the context is , of course , the context of ergonomics a conceived by the designer of the list .
routine
a routine is the most common form of instructional material .
the reader is required to follow a series of step which might , for example , introduce a change in the performance of a complex system .
normally routine are single chain of instruction although it is possible to have some conditional branching .
each step should be simple and complete in itself â€” preferably with some indication that successful completion ha been achieved , for example the appearance or the change of colour of a signal light , or the noise of a motor starting or a change of pressure which indicates that there ha been a change in the flow of some material .
a mentioned earlier a routine can often be regarded a a written task description .
by definition and design intention routine are inflexible .
the user is intended to behave exactly according to their instruction .
no great skill or intellectual effort is required , which is one way of saying that the human operator is being under-used , but the purpose of a routine is usually to avoid common human error such a omitting a step or reversing step .
in general the value of formal routine is precisely that the operator , left to himself , will not normally function in such a systematic sequential manner .
knowledge text
knowledge is contained in document which may vary from single sheet presentation to large manual .
a instructional material it is indirect in that the reader is not necessarily told what to do , a in a routine .
rather he is informed about the situation and the purpose of informing him is to provide a knowledge base from which he can work out his own action .
nevertheless , the relevant action remains important and the knowledge provided should be carefully and stringently selected .
it is too easy to follow the academic tradition and provide knowledge for it own sake .
the â€˜ need to know â€™ criterion is crucial because unless it is applied , the operator can be overburdened with unnecessary material .
correspondingly the material should be structured in term of how it is most likely to be used .
in this context the operator requires a guide for action and not a scientific text-book .
it is invariably better to provide material diagrammatically , systematically or at least in well-structured short paragraph rather than in flowing prose .
consider for example how readily information about the relative position of street is available from a map of a town centre rather than a verbal description of all the street .
such a map will enable the reader to work out for himself how to get from one location to another within the town .
note the enormous flexibility compared with a routine which would tell him only how to get from one particular point to another .
a second important difference is that if he miss his place in a routine he will be totally lost , whereas if he happens to go in the wrong direction while using a map he is still able to make whatever correction is necessary .
however the map doe require more intellectual effort than doe the routine not only in making decision about how to proceed but also in filtering out the required information from the massive irrelevance ( for a particular task ) which is equally available .
thus , one would expect the use of the map to be slower than the use of routine with the human performance being more versatile but le predictable .
with two-dimensional representation such a map it remains important to avoid too much homogeneity and provide substructure in the form of main road and key building or other feature such a river .
see , for example , fig. 5.3
manual which may contain map , schematic diagram and other material warrant separate consideration .
the design of manual
a manual is usually in the form of a book or booklet which is sent with the hardware from the maker to the customer .
it is part of the communication package from the designer to the user .
thus it is a particular form of job aid which provides the operator with information on a system and it performance .
the standard of manual design ha traditionally been very low for several reason .
for this purpose , the designer is too familiar with the product and he rarely take the trouble to find out what the user really need to know .
often the manual ha to be provided hurriedly at the end of a project when the budget is running out , and it is regarded a a tiresome chore still required after the essential design work ha been completed .
the problem is particularly acute for computer .
manual for car , machine tool and so on are poor but at least it is possible to observe the mechanism and their function .
most computer operator do not know or wish to know about the mechanism , and in any case these are not accessible to vision and manipulation .
the computer operator is entirely dependent on the manual , at least in the early stage of gaining familiarity with the system and it function .
he is usually very badly served although the principle of manual design are well known .
for most system the manual is best divided into part a indicated in table 1.17 .
the first part should be a general introduction which orientates the reader towards the system , it purpose , it functional structure and mode of operation and it performance limit .
this should be followed by a separate section on how to set the system up in the first place and how to check that it is working properly .
if it is fairly small it may be necessary to describe how to unpack it , fix it into position , connect it to power supply and start it up .
if it is large , the emphasis will be on the start up procedure .
the section describing the operation of the system should cover not only how the system operates but also how the user can operate it .
extensive use of line drawing , schematic diagram , algorithmic list is desirable , and where prose is used this also should be structured into short sentence with meaningful separation into paragraph .
the maintenance section should indicate what , if anything , the operator is expected to do and the symptom which indicate that more specialist maintenance skill are required .
table subdivided into faults/reasons/m_remedies can be extremely helpful .
part list including description reference number and sometimes drawing are necessary if the user is expected to deal with his own replacement .
a standard fault is to assume that the reader is familiar with the jargon which the designer habitually us .
a glossary of term and acronym used can be very helpful not only to the reader but also to the writer who is forced to consider carefully how he is using various technical term .
finally , all manual should end with an index which supplement the table of content at the beginning .
attempting to integrate under five
policy in islington , 1983â€“8
margaret boushel , clare debenham , lisa dresner and anna gorbach
during the 1980s margaret boushel , claire debenham , lisa dresner and anna gorbach worked in the london borough of islington within social service for pre-school child .
this chapter is an account of the way they perceived attempt to develop integrated provision for under five and the barrier in attitude and system which were encountered .
the first section provides an overview of provision and service in 1983 .
the next section describes attempt to create a clear under-fives policy .
the third section look at the faltering progress towards integrated service .
the fourth section examines the formidable barrier that were posed by reorganisation of social service , local authority cut and the demise of the inner london education authority .
the chapter concludes with a mixture of resignation and determination .
background : under-fives service in islington , 1983
islington is a multi-ethnic , inner city london borough with a child population of 29,000 .
in 1982 , 44 per cent of under five in islington had the use of an under-fives facility , 29 per cent on a full-time and 15 per cent on a part-time basis .
between 1982 and 1988 provision gradually increased , so that by 1988 there were 12 child 's day centre , about 70 playgroups and 350 assisted child-minding place funded partially or totally by the social service department , and 1,075 full-time and 824 part-time place in nursery school funded by the inner london education authority .
the beacon nursery , a local mencap project , offered care five day per week to child over one year of age categorised a having severe learning difficulty .
unlike council day centre , playgroups or community nursery , the beacon nursery wa free .
child were collected from home by special bus and place were available on demand .
the beacon had been in existence for many year and in the past had catered for up to thirty child with a wide range of disability and need .
by 1983 it had half that number on roll .
since 1983 number at the beacon continued to fall a it wa increasingly seen a a resource for child with severe and multiple disability .
in addition the elfreda rathbone organisation , a voluntary organisation helping people with learning disability , ran a free day nursery in the borough for a small number of child with learning difficulty .
some integrated service emerged in the early 1980s â€” one playscheme wa developed through a parent 's initiative , and an integrated adventure playground wa established by a voluntary organisation .
worker from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported a local special school in integrating under five into a playgroup .
in addition to it mainstream school , the borough included five special school providing primary and secondary education to child with special need from islington and neighbouring borough â€” one for child with moderate learning difficulty , one for child with severe learning difficulty , one for child with emotional and behavioural difficulty , one for autistic child , and one for child with physical disability .
in 1983 three of these offered nursery place to child from the age of 2 .
the child using all of these service came from a wide range of ethnic background , though rarely wa this actively and positively reflected in the type of care provided or the ethnic background of their carers .
residential unit
by 1983 residential service were designed with â€˜ care in the community â€™ in mind , but most were based in specialist setting .
for example , field end house had been open for three year a a specialist unit for child with learning difficulty , and wa designed to offer respite â€˜ round the clock â€™ care .
parent had fought for this a a local resource to prevent the need for child to be placed in long-stay placement far from home .
by 1988 field end had been joined by another specialist child 's respite care unit at leigh road .
the social service department also provided thirteen short-term and long-term residential unit for child in care ( by 1988 their number had been reduced to eleven ) , none with wheelchair access and only one with any experience of caring for child with learning difficulty .
the community health team
the community health team had major responsibility for assessing child and recommending provision .
it included physiotherapist , occupational and speech therapist , doctor , psychologist and a specialist health visitor .
they were joined in the network by specialist teacher , funded by the ilea and based in the special school , who visited child at home before they were due to start school .
this group of people met on a regular basis to coordinate service and discus professional issue .
discussion of service to individual child also took place .
this included deciding between day care or school , and parent ' attitude to different option .
often a member of the group wa delegated to advise parent on a course of action .
the community health team aim wa to ensure a place of treatment for child from the earliest possible age , to enable them to develop to their fullest potential .
they were , however , an all-white group , operating without directly involving parent and were generally committed to specialist care in the community .
they gave support to the beacon and elfreda rathbone nursery and most member saw these setting a the best place to â€˜ treat â€™ child .
because of their early contact with parent they often had considerable influence in steering parent towards specialist provision .
the special service team
in the early 1980s social worker were funded jointly by the ilea and islington social service department to work with child attending two special school and two specialist unit for â€˜ partially hearing â€™ child .
these social worker were based in the borough 's special service team .
they all worked with some under five attending the school they covered .
they were aware of a number of pre-school child who did not have adequate access to resource or support when parent and professional were becoming aware of the possible extent and implication of the disability .
when a vacancy arose within this group of social worker in 1983 it wa decided to appoint someone specialising in work with under five with special need .
this might have had the effect of drawing family into the specialist system at an earlier stage .
instead , for a number of reason , it proved to be a key step in the development of the debate about integration in islington .
first , the post wa not attached to any specialist institution .
there wa an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely with the beacon nursery .
second , the worker had an alternative peer group of under-fives worker who were key figure in controlling access to all other under-fives facility .
third , the worker wa committed to the idea that treatment of a medical or disabling condition should not take precedence over the child 's social , emotional and cultural need .
there wa now a new worker in the network who also made an early relationship with family but who could present a broader choice of day care to parent .
attempting an integration policy
the labour council , elected in 1982 , had a a stated policy aim that every child whose parent so wished wa entitled to a pre-school place of some sort .
this led to the initiation of an under-fives review .
the review team , set up under the auspex of the social service committee , included councillor , senior departmental management and representative of the child 's day centre organiser and under-fives social worker in it membership .
it proposed a network of under-fives centre throughout the borough â€” an idea which the under-fives worker had been anxious to promote for some time .
day care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the child 's day centre which would also provide information , support and resource to parent .
the review had made no mention of child with special need .
the specialist social worker and another under-fives worker with a personal interest in the issue undertook a supplementary review to examine resource for these child .
they interviewed parent , specialist professional and mainstream day-care worker and they designed a questionnaire which wa completed by worker in a large proportion of mainstream council service and voluntary organisation , a well a by some child-minders .
broadly , the survey confirmed that parent of child with special need had not been given a real choice of placement , and that they had to fight hard for mainstream provision if this wa their choice .
parent wanted to be part of the decision-making and did not feel that they were .
many commented on lack of information about the range of facility on offer .
one afro-caribbean woman described how she felt that she wa never given a choice of provision for her son , and objected to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good .
she fought hard to get him a part-time playgroup place in the group his older brother attended .
because the group had known her and her child for some time they agreed to â€˜ have a go â€™ and the placement went ahead .
she commented :
i had to fight every step of the way for this .
no one told me about it , and no one wanted him to have it .
i knew it wa right for him â€” this is where he learnt to join in and be like other child .
it doe n't matter that he 's not like them .
i know what is right for my child , but i 'm not supposed to say .
parent also wanted an increased availability of specialist â€˜ therapy â€™ time , but wanted it to be used in a more flexible way .
some parent were very worried that more integrated setting would lead to lack of attention for child with special need .
definition of â€˜ special need â€™ varied widely in the questionnaire response â€” some defining it a child with disability , some including child with behavioural and emotional problem and some including child whose first language wa not english .
this made the survey difficult to interpret .
the finding were documented in a report a place for all our child ( ccuf 1983 ) and an analysis wa prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problem in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special need , with suggestion for how these might be overcome .
these idea were informed by a paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local mencap group , who had previously tried to generate the debate within the community health service through the mencap committee .
the conference : â€˜ a place for all our children'
a a result of this work the coordinating committee for under five ( ccuf ) , an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector group and individual providing a service to under five , decided to organise a conference to look at the issue of integration of special need child within mainstream provision .
prior to the conference various group met to produce short contribution to the debate .
these included parent , under-fives worker , specialist worker , child 's day centre organiser and playgroups organiser .
each of these group came up with a list of proposal which were sent to everyone attending .
about 230 people attended the conference , held in april 1985 .
workshop facilitated by the speaker and the conference organising group examined integration policy , overcoming practical problem for child in integrated provision and available source of information .
the conference made the following recommendation :
1
for a formal , universal information system , covering local and specialist resource .
2
for child 's need to be considered with parent and their wish acknowledged and recognised .
3
for employment of extra staff where needed , and employment of peripatetic special need worker .
4
for availability of money for equipment , toy and adaptation .
5
for enhanced payment to child-minders caring for child with special need .
6
for priority status for child with special need in order to facilitate access to ordinary provision .
7
for training facility for staff in ordinary provision , specialist provision and child-minders .
8
for greater communication and sharing of resource between ordinary and specialist provision .
9
for therapeutic and professional staff to reflect the cultural background of the child , and that for all child , including those with special need , their day-care environment and activity to express a consciousness of the multicultural society in islington .
it wa made clear that all of the above area needed funding from health , education and social service before they could be implemented .
finally , it wa felt that unless the attitude of adviser and information-givers became more positive towards integration , none of the recommendation could be effective .
( d ) warfare and crusade
the poet marbod of rennes celebrated ( in latin ) the vengeance which would befall a wicked castellan and his troop :
the poem highlight two important twelfth-century development : the use of force in punishing aristocratic crime ( the fruit of princely peace-keeping ) , and the increasing significance of siege-engines in warfare .
intellectual claimed a formative influence in the second too : john of marmoutier declared that monk from his own monastery had read vegetius ' de re militari to geoffrey le bel when he wa investing the castle of a rebellious castellan , and ascribed his success to their advice on firebomb .
but common sense may have been more important than learning in perceiving the vulnerability of most castle to â€” battering-rams and catapult ; for even in 1100 they were , a a rule , primitive structure .
siege-engines demanded on the one hand skilled operator , and on the other a plentiful supply of unskilled labourer to move the necessary material .
this effectively restricted their use to the wealthy and to those whose claim to assistance under the ban wa incontrovertible .
equally , the improvement in fortification needed to withstand their effect â€” thick stone wall , inner a well a outer defence â€” required income greater than those of simple lord .
the net effect wa that , given dedication , prince â€” louis vi , geoffrey le bel , alphonse-jourdain â€” could subdue rebellious castellans within their own demesne , and could build castle of their own which were impregnable to all but lengthy and sustained attack .
henry ii 's castle at chinon , where the treasury of anjou wa situated , wa the model for it generation , with it hall , upper chamber , tower , and curtain walling , set on a high point above a strategic crossing of the loire .
it could be copied only either by those of nearly equal wealth or by those who could concentrate their resource chiefly on defence â€” prince , great bishop or , in the south especially , town .
all others became vulnerable .
john of salisbury 's comment that not only the town but also the fortress of gaul feared henry i of england wa revealing of the new situation .
similarly , campaigning in the field imposed an increasing financial burden .
the treaty between robert ii of flanders and henry i of england , renewed by their successor , stipulated that each knight supplied to the english king should bring three horse with him â€” this at a time when a horse represented a major investment .
then knightly armour grew more elaborate and costly throughout the century .
and though some knight might be supplied free by feudal service , household one had to be maintained by their lord , mercenary one needed pay , and those with money-fiefs constituted a regular charge on the treasury .
besides , away from their home base , knight were useless on their own .
in open battle and in the plundering expedition that constituted the normal form of aggressive warfare , they needed the backing of archer , both mounted and on foot , and of numerous infantryman .
the usual source of supply wa town militia â€” suger mention those of rheims , chã¢lons , laon , soissons , orlã©ans , etampes , and paris in the royal army of 1124 .
but they might have to be supplemented by mercenary from flanders and the low country , where the rapidly expanding population forced large number of young men into military career .
in the eye of the faithful , these â€˜ brabanters â€™ , with their freebooting and lack of discipline after the end of campaign , were a dangerous a heretic ; in 1171 frederick barbarossa and louis vii agreed to expel them from their land .
their value in battle , a shield behind which the knight could shelter before they launched their charge , ensured their continued employment by those who could afford them â€” notably henry ii of england .
but the hatred they aroused meant that they were liable to be brutally slaughtered if captured afterwards .
inevitably , therefore , war on the grand scale a fought by prince bore little resemblance in practice to the feud of lesser men .
the divergence wa sharpened by the application of a theoretical distinction , the fruit of augustinian theology , amplified a the century went on by canon and roman law reference ; prince pronounced their campaign just war ( fought against aggressor with the aim of re-establishing peace ) or public war ( declared by a competent authority in the public interest ) , while they condemned the war of lesser men a infraction of the peace .
geoffrey martel had perceived the propaganda potential of public war a early a the mid eleventh century ; later it enabled henry the liberal of champagne to claim the military service of all lord within his county , a reapplication of the carolingian ban .
so it could be a powerful weapon .
yet the logic of the definition suggested that it would benefit especially king , whose competence to declare war could not be impugned : thus thibaud of blois failed to persuade the monk of marmoutier that they owed him service when he fought against louis vi ; they claimed discretion in the matter ; and in 1184 , the mighty philip of alsace hesitated to commit to battle the army he had summoned against philip augustus , through fear that it rank might melt away .
the contrast with the united front louis vi and his troop presented to the emperor henry v in 1124 wa marked .
a royal banner now bestowed respectability on a cause ; king ' war were assumed to be for the sake of peace , even when cripplingly expensive and increasingly savage .
this go some way to explaining why the complicated campaign within toulouse in the second half of the century were largely fought out under the banner of the angevin , aragonese , and french king ; and why the revolt of henry ii 's son had widespread ramification .
the twelfth century wa characterized , therefore , by fewer but more protracted war , which smouldered for long period between short , sharp bout of conflict , like the war that covered must of the reign of henry i of england and louis vi of france , the one inaugurated by the great rebellion of 1173 , which outlived both louis vii and henry ii , or that against catalan claim in the south .
into these large number of local conflict were subsumed .
the pattern caused problem , in that the circumstance which might trigger off renewed fighting were unpredictable ; yet the moment an opportunity offered , prince had to be prepared for invading their enemy ; there wa no time for lengthy preparation .
the usual tactic wa to march troop across the enemy 's territory , plundering and looting ; to take fortified place if the task wa easy ; to obtain ally among the lord of the locality ; and to retreat without fighting a battle if at all possible â€” in effect an application to a wider canvas of the some technique of warfare which had earlier made castellans formidable in the immediate environs of their castle .
it necessitated the rapid mobilization of auxiliary to join a core of highly-trained troop kept constantly , at the ready â€” the prince ' military household , which became the linch pin of the system .
john of marmoutier 's life of geoffrey le bel offer a glimpse of how strong bond were created between the prince and his follower within the household , and how a high level of training wa maintained at all time .
geoffrey wa brought up from infancy with the son of neighbouring angevin lord , on whose companionship he relied .
when it came time for him to be knighted by henry i in rouen , he set off for normandy with a crowd of these young men about him .
in rouen , the occasion wa celebrated with pomp , elaborate dress , and a great feast , and then the youth all demonstrated their military skill at a grand tournament , at which geoffrey naturally won the highest honour .
it wa within this kind of environment that chivalry flourished , that young men learned to identify , their vassalage towards their lord a a symbol of their honour , that they debated the relative merit of roland 's and oliver 's way of displaying loyalty ; and that they learned the finer point of jousting .
tournament were disapproved of by ecclesiastic , for they could be both bloody and dangerous .
yet they supplied real need : .
that of an instruction in the martial art compatible with the maintenance of a prince 's peace ; that of an outlet for competitive instinct within the claustrophobic confines of a court ; and that of display to maintain princely social status .
so they flourished everywhere .
they offered opportunity for men of skill to acquire great position in the world â€” arnoul of ardres caught the eye of countess ida of boulogne through his exploit ; and they also conferred lustre on the great â€” geoffrey le bel and philip of alsace were throughout france for their distinguished performance in these show battle .
all this formed a background to the first century of crusading ; and it go some way to explaining the more secular aspect of the magnetism which drew french knight to take up the cross in their thousand .
urban ii , launching the first crusade at clermont in 1095 , presented it a a natural evolution of the peace movement : warrior were to forget their petty feud and squabble in a campaign to promote the interest of holy church .
the war , declared by one whose moral authority wa unimpeachable , wa to free the eastern church , to end muslim guardianship of the holy place , to restore jerusalem to it proper state .
a prince saw it , it wa a just war in the fullest sense of the term ; those who were slaughtered in it battle were regarded a among the martyr of the church .
when raymond of toulouse , robert ii of flanders , robert curthose , stephen of blois , and hugh of vermandois responded to the call , past and present member of their military household fell almost automatically into rank behind them , to test themselves against terrible danger , but also to enjoy the companionship in arm , the adventure , the deed of daring which were the stuff of the chansons de geste .
that they shared , along with all other participant in the crusade , a fervent devotion , a conviction that their sin would be forgiven , is certain .
yet for them crusading necessitated no large leap of the imagination , no millenarian vision ; it wa simply a challenging and a deserving extension of their everyday activity .
in french eye , the hero of the first crusade wa robert ii of flanders .
while raymond of toulouse remained in outremer , stephen and hugh disgraced themselves in escaping from the siege of antioch , and robert curthose , no matter how gallant , at least in his lifetime failed to impress , robert ii 's prestige soared to the sky .
he became robert of jerusalem to his contemporary ; his deed were recorded in the song of antioch ; his pious bravery totally expunged the memory of robert the frisian 's usurpation ; and after his death his son baldwin vii harped on his father 's achievement to justify his substantial use of coercion against the enemy of the church .
outside flanders , robert 's sister 's marriage to roger of sicily wa a mark of his new position in the world ; like louis vi 's sister 's marriage to bohemond of antioch , it stretched french kinship connection into the new norman colony , ensuring that traveller from the homeland would find a welcome in those distant part .
robert 's example wa a potent one .
after the next change in dynasty , thierry and philip of alsace strengthened their shaky claim to the comital position by attaining for themselves the prestige attached to being the outstanding crusader of their generation .
thierry 's remote connection with the family of godfrey de bouillon , along with his marriage with sybilla of anjou , fulk v 's daughter , gave him some claim to the throne of jerusalem ; a a consequence , the aristocracy of outremer viewed him and philip with mixed feeling , expecting much of them , yet fearing their ambition .
in the end , it wa not in outremer but in the newly conquered byzantine empire that the flemish crusading achievement wa crowned with the elevation of count baldwin ix to the imperial throne in 1204 .
but in the twelfth century , the house of alsace could afford the high cost of their expedition â€” thierry went to jerusalem four time , philip twice â€” and the count ' repeated absence in fact promoted administrative reform ; the baillis and the grote bref were a much the product of crusading a the english and norman judicial system and exchequer were the product of the king-duke 's divided attention .
but if , on balance , the flemish count benefited materially from crusading , â€” a , arguably , did the angevin â€” they were far from typical .
for other french house a commitment to outremer often represented a sacrifice of domestic political interest .
the achievement of raymond iv st gilles in consolidating his authority within toulouse were threatened by his departure in 1095 , especially since it wa known that he had no intention of returning home .
then his example lured his elder son bertrand to tripoli in 1112 , and his younger son alphonse jourdain there in 1147 .
had not his grandson raymond v fulfilled his crusading obligation in his early youth , thereby freeing himself from the necessity of interrupting his career in the county , the principality of toulouse might have disintegrated altogether .
william ix 's crusade of 1101 brought about serious financial problem in aquitaine which caused rapid devaluation in the hitherto stable currency ; and robert curthose 's decision to mortgage normandy to william rufus in order to cover his crusading expense exacerbated a conflict over the duchy which wa not settled until the death of his son william clito in 1128 .
all in all , it wa not surprising that suger , mulling over the precedent of early crusading , tried to dissuade louis vii from embarking on his jerusalem journey in 1145 .
yet the appeal of crusading wa , if anything , even stronger to those aristocratic house just below the level of the princely : it wa , after all , the house of boulogne which produced the first two ruler of jerusalem .
the count of nevers , the lord of montpellier , the lord of amboise and lusignan , the trencavels , were fervent devotee of the ideal ; so the problem of absence , shipwreck , death abroad plagued them a much a their prince .
on occasion , their determination to sacrifice for christ played directly into their overlord 's hand , a when the count of la marche , who had no direct heir , sold his county to king henry ii in 1177 .
when it did not , accompanying their prince in a joint crusading venture , a the lord of amboise accompanied fulk v or hugh vi de lusignan william ix , created new personal link .
the political spin-off from crusading are therefore more difficult to calculate than at first glance they might appear .
nevertheless it is clear that the chief gainer wa louis vii .
the irony of this lay in the fact that the second crusade wa counter-productive in outremer , embittered relation with byzantium , and resulted in the death of enormous number of it participant , particularly those drawn from the nonâ­aristocratic class .
yet it consolidated the king 's position within france , partly through the skilled regency of suger , but also because , in taking on himself the leadership of the expedition , louis re-emerged a a credible ruler of men .
his noble gesture appeased those churchman who had been appalled by his early obstinacy over the archbishopric of bourges .
the disaster that befell his army paradoxically heightened his personal charisma : even the baron of outremer continued to look on him a their one potential saviour .
his friendship with raymond v of toulouse , a fellow warrior , reversed the trend of history since the middle of the tenth century , in bringing the prince of the far south back into the king 's mouvance .
the crowd of burgundians who accompanied the king learned to respect him ; on their return , they sought the arbitration of the royal court in their dispute , and they welcomed louis 's intervention within the county that fringed the duchy of burgundy .
a william of st denis put it ,
even a early a 1147 it wa apparent that the crusading movement had provided a new sense of aristocratic cohesion in the realm .
the great joint expedition , the combined leadership , although not without friction , had been justified by their outstanding achievement , the conquest and maintenance of jerusalem .
they were the gesta francorum , the deed of the frank , or the gesta dei per franco , god 's deed performed through the frank , a two of their earliest chronicler entitled them .
but what wa missing before 1147 wa a clear sense of who the frank were .
the second crusade , however , wa launched with st bernard 's ringing appeal to the count and baron of brittany :
in taking his place at the head of the second crusade , the rex francorum decisively hastened the transformation of the frank into the french .
revival under law , 1911â€“1914
few contemporary would have expected balfour 's retirement to lead to a unionist recovery .
the party wa in a mutinous condition in november 1911 and there wa no apparent successor who would have even half of balfour 's political gift .
nor wa it clear that balfour 's departure wa universally desired : at the national union conference a few day later , leo maxse wa booed off the platform , and constituency party everywhere passed resolution regretting balfour 's decision .
a great many crocodile tear were shed , for , since unionist had such an elevated view of the principle of leadership , they were unable to accept that they had just driven their own leader from office .
the shock caused by balfour 's going thus did something to steady the party and it certainly produced a real determination to settle the affair of the party with le friction than had been fashionable of late .
the main contender for the leadership were austen chamberlain and walter long , representing the two different establishment of the edwardian unionist party â€” the opposite world of birmingham and wiltshire â€” but the situation wa complicated by the intervention of two outsider , edward carson and andrew bonar law .
two strong group emerged behind long and chamberlain , about equal in number , but there were few backer for carson or law .
carson thereupon fell out of the contest â€” or rather announced that he wa not standing , for no official nomination had been made .
the party officer and whip were solidly behind chamberlain , but law drew off some of his support among tariff reformer and , urged on by edward goulding and max aitken , he refused to withdraw unless his continued candidature would allow long to win .
against chamberlain it wa remembered that he wa a liberal unionist ( a wa lansdowne , who led the unionist in the lord ) and that he had not been entirely loyal to balfour since the referendum pledge .
long wa supported by the bulk of the english county member but by few of the party 's men of talent .
by the morning of friday 10 november it wa clear that neither chamberlain nor long would secure a majority and that some supporter of each of them would not contentedly follow the other .
a party meeting wa to be held on the following monday and the whip were making preparation for a vote to be taken .
chamberlain provided the way out by suggesting to balcarres that both he and long should withdraw and so allow law to be elected unanimously ; he also turned down balcarres 's remarkable advice that he should allow long to be elected since long would make such a mess of thing that chamberlain would be bound to succeed within the year .
faced with chamberlain 's proposition , and without a majority of his own , long had no option but to agree .
bonar law , backed by fewer mp than any of the other three contender at the beginning of the week wa now to be the unanimous choice .
robert sander reported the election meeting on 13 november with evident satisfaction :
the carlton meeting on monday went off quite admirably .
harry chaplin in the chair a very great success .
a good many men came into the room by no mean inclined to acquiesce in the proposed arrangement .
walter long proposed bonar law .
his speech wa one of the best thing i have heard .
manly and rather touching .
the country gentleman at his best .
he spoke and evidently felt strongly of the degradation that it would have been to the parry to have elected a leader by secret ballot .
austen followed .
when austen sat down chaplin suggested that he had better put the question at once and on getting an affirmative shout did so .
a clever way of stifling discussion and few could have done it so well .
motion carried unanimously .
bonar law then sent for â€¦
his speech struck me a the feeblest of the day .
he wa evidently moved and nervous .
the meeting separated in great content with the conservative party all round .
it wa certainly creditable .
the urgency of the event following balfour 's resignation wa due to the need to find a new leader before the national union conference .
so within a few day of his grudging acceptance by his parliamentary colleague , law 's leadership wa ratified by the throng of party notable at leeds ; here he received a reception more typical of what wa to come in the future .
in 1911 law wa known â€” in so far a he wa known at all in the parliamentary party â€” a a spirited debater .
a. ) .
p. taylor ha noted that law wa trained , if he wa trained for anything in his early career , to be a debater .
in glasgow he had picked up many of the skill that a more highly-born politician might have acquired in the oxford union or at the bar , but skill that were very different in appearance .
his concern wa solely with effectiveness rather than style ; he rarely spoke with more than brief note and left it to the occasion to furnish the word .
( when he became chancellor of the exchequer this practice caused consternation at the treasury , when he used only a page of note to assist him in moving complicated resolution on wartime finance ; he relied successfully on his memory to provide detail and figure . )
a an extempore speaker he wa able to tailor his word to his audience 's reaction and so convey the impression of personal conversation even when addressing thousand .
in parliament he wa wont to abandon an argument half-completed if he sensed that his point had been made ; the speech that appear in hansard were touched up by his staff , and his speech in the country were given to the press in advance .
in debate he wa a formidable opponent , and one that asquith wa never able to master , for all his forensic skill .
again law succeeded by unorthodoxy ; he wa quick to grasp the essential of an opponent 's argument and quite prepared to be rude or direct if the situation demanded it .
in the long debate over marconi in 1913 and over the curragh mutiny in 1914 law wa able to nail asquith 's evasion where a more polished stylist might have been foiled .
occasionally , in the onrush of pursuit , he gave commitment that were later regretted , but these were a small price to pay .
the unionist recovery wa built around law 's leadership , but what asquith called the new style of obstruction , threat and offensive behaviour did not originate with law .
the beginning are to be found in the diehard campaign against the parliament bill .
it wa in june 1911 that the first scene of disorder were mounted in the house of common , led by lord hugh cecil .
in august 1911 the diehard peer used language a violent a any that law wa to use later , and in the crucial decision on the house of lord law sided with the hedger rather than the ditchers .
ulster 's opposition to home rule long pre-dated law 's leadership and he had rarely even spoken on irish affair in parliament before becoming leader .
before he succeeded balfour then , law wa not associated with any of the feature that were to characterize his party leadership ; his contribution wa to use the leadership in the service of all of these cause , to make himself the spokesman for the most spirited section of the party .
law conceived of the role of the leader in an exactly opposite sense from balfour : he sought to foster unity by placing himself at the head of the discordant element where balfour had thrown the leadership on the side of restraint .
their respective position explain this in part : a ex-prime minister and a considerable figure in his own right , balfour had the confidence to believe in his own judgement even when isolated from the bulk of the party ; a the tertium quid in the recent contest , law had neither the weight nor the confidence to take such a detached view .
his strategy wa rather to canalize the enthusiasm of the diehard into party channel , to articulate their view , and to create unity from the sense of movement .
in his characteristic phrase , i am their leader , i must follow them â€” but he determined to follow them from the front .
a a result of this he wa labelled a a diehard and a bigot , when he actually distrusted the diehard and wa himself distrusted by the bigot .
much of his leadership wa thus a form of pragmatic extremism , extreme action and the threat of more extreme action to come , but used in the cause of more limited objective .
he certainly held deep conviction a to the absolute wrongness of the liberal policy that he opposed , but at least a part of his apparent hostility wa assumed for the occasion , a hard line that might secure a better compromise in the end .
so in his first major speech a leader in parliament he wasted little time on the customary compliment and warned the government that he intended to play hard .
in private conversation he told asquith i am afraid that i shall have to show myself very vicious mr asquith this session .
i hope you will understand .
in later conversation about ulster , law wa frank enough to point out that bloodshed in ulster would be the best way of ensuring an electoral landslide for the unionist .
there wa then an open toughness about party tactic ; before the buckingham palace conference in 1914 he had central office work out the electoral effect of excluding nine , six or four county of ulster from an independent ireland the concern of a calculating pragmatist not of a bigot .
from the party viewpoint law 's method were successful but dangerous ; expectation raised when the party wa in full cry were not easily set aside for an eventual compromise , and the only outcome that would fully vindicate the method wa the recovery of power .
the basis of recovery wa then law 's fighting capacity a leader .
in parliament there would be a carefully organized campaign of resistance that would at least slow the government down and raise unionist morale .
improved morale would also make possible organizational advance outside parliament , all linked to the issue of ulster , and with the sight fixed firmly on the next election , an election that would make or break the union , the empire and law 's leadership of the party .
all wa linked to the sense of a new departure , a new style , a new regime in politics and a new team at the helm : a well a a new leader , the party had by the middle of 1912 a new chief whip , party chairman , party treasurer , principal agent , press adviser , and an almost entirely new team of whip and organizer .
party organization provided the easiest advance because it wa the only area entirely under the party 's control .
no general election wa fought by the organization set up after 1911 , but there is little doubt that there wa a massive improvement ; criticism that were commonplace in 1910 were not to be heard by 1913 .
the space available to central office wa increased by the acquisition of st stephen 's house a well a st stephen 's chamber , which had been occupied since 1874 ; the new office cost $3,000 a year in rent alone .
the quality of the senior staff wa improved by the appointment of three specialist .
john boraston took over a principal agent in 1912 , having been a professional organizer all his career and latterly chief agent to the liberal unionist council .
he joined william jenkins , appointed chief organizing agent in 1911 and previously district agent for the midland liberal unionist .
the party wa indeed handed over to birmingham .
finally , malcolm fraser , ex-editor of the standard and of the daily express became first honorary press adviser and subsequently wa employed to run the press bureau at the colossal salary of â£1,200 .
steel-maitland , boraston , jenkins and fraser made up a team of expert , all of sufficient status to deal with politician who might call into the office ; the work of the office wa departmentalized for the first time and the head of department brought together into a supervising board .
the influence of central office toned up the rest of the organization .
a new canvas system wa introduced in 1911 so that all county constituency would operate the same system and so that duplicate record could be kept at area level .
this wa important at a time when outvoters were a larger group in many constituency than the size of the majority and when the outvoters were overwhelmingly unionist .
in 1914 a register of car owner wa compiled , also important when some voter could cast several vote in an election when polling went several day .
by november 1912 only fifty-one constituency in great britain were without candidate , a much better position than the position at dissolution in either 1909 or 1910 ; few of these fifty-one constituency were winnable , but in any case most of them had candidate by the end of 1913 .
a programme of speaker for a general election wa also ready by 1913 , with both constituency and politician told in advance what they might expect .
the financial mismanagement that had reigned before 1911 wa ended with the employment of professional accountant .
expenditure on central office , district office and the london office doubled from â£32,466 in 1909â€“10 to $68,957 in 1913â€“14 ; the total expenditure of the party organization from central fund also doubled from $73,000 to over â£150,000 .
to pay for this outpouring , a great drive wa mounted for additional income -by farquhar and steel-maitland .
in 1912 ordinary subscription still brought in only â£12000 a year and it proved difficult to raise them to anything like what wa needed .
the method adopted wa to canvas for capital donation that could then be invested to bring in a regular income , and both balfour and law were used to raise the wind .
steel-maitland told balfour that farquhar and i are endeavouring to raise more money .
i think we are likely to succeed â€” thanks in part to the very generous example set by lord rothschild .
but i would b , e very glad if i might see you on your return to ask you to help me in two case .
systematic collection were made from peer and from the city ; by the outbreak of war the invested fund amounted to $671,000 â€” twice the sum in 1911 and worth four year expenditure â€” and there wa a special cash deposit of â£120,000 for the coming election .
in three other area , a much political a organizational , advance were made towards the management of the press , the coordination of the heterogeneous collection that made up the party , and the fostering of modern attitude in the local party .
under malcolm fraser the party began to make effective use of it support in fleet street .
it had been recognized that liberal had been more adept at handling the press because they were more ready to stoop to newspaper practice , a sandars had reported in 1909 :
i told northcliffe that if his people would make enquiry at our central office , he would find that our nightly regiment of speaker wa at least a well worth reporting a the radical contingent , but that i realized that from the press point of view , no doubt , our speaker did not play up to the reporter by> handing them their speech in advance , and by other trick of the kind to which the radical orator have recourse .
this wa the essence of the problem : the press could only be managed by someone who knew their method and who would not expect them to come round to central office to search for news .
the uoc found that it is patent that some feeling exists among the unionist press that , while in the past they have done much for the party , the party ha not assisted in their work .
in many quarter it is asserted that the unionist press are treated with greater courtesy by the radical than by their own side .
fraser dealt with this problem without difficulty and explained to law in 1913 that the importance of getting important speech in advance is shown in concrete manner by your wallsend speech on october 29th .
the verbatim report reached most of the newspaper in place such a aberdeen at one o clock in the morning of the 30th .
he went on to quote the response that had been received from editor :
manchester dispatch : i hope you will continue this form of enterprise .
you fully know a an old pressman the difficulty of dealing with a big speech late at night â€¦
daily express : i am much obliged to you for the precis of mr bonar law 's speech last night .
it wa a great help to u .
the speech came over the wire so late and the sheet were so confused by the post office â€” which is usual in these case â€” that without the precis we could not possibly have got the leader through in time for the first edition .
so in the supply of information to newspaper predisposed to support the party , much wa achieved merely by employing a specialist .
the other side of press management , depending on informal contact , is le easy to ass .
in 1911 steel-maitland invited blumenfeld of the daily express to central office for a two-way exchange of idea and advice .
he also used law himself to impress editor who were on le familiar term with fraser , a with marlowe of the daily mail , and law took a direct interest in negotiation with the most difficult of all the unionist editor , j. l. garvin of the observer .
law personally conducted the negotiation with gardner sinclair over the sale of the observer and the pall mall gazette in 1914 ; this negotiation also demonstrates that , a well a producing information and nursing editor , the party had to work hard to keep some of the newspaper in business .
sinclair did buy the observer and the pall mall in the end , but not before he had been given a $45,000 guarantee from party fund .
such investment had a double purpose , for they could bring in income and provide a political bonus .
one such scheme involved the purchase of the daily express by max aitken with party fund , but the party wa also propping up the globe , the standard , and a wide range of provincial daily .
all these transaction were secret , for there would be little use in keeping a paper alive if it were known to be owned by a political party .
the paper were therefore bought through nominee or bank loan backed with party capital .
it wa usual to extract some form of guarantee in exchange for party support but the secrecy prevented such undertaking from being enforced .
sinclair thus gave an undertaking that his paper would always remain unionist , but steel-maitland doubted if such a promise had any value .
the later history of the daily express suggests not : when the express became hostile in the 1920s , younger raged when i think of the large sum of money this office ha put into that gutter print it make my blood boil .
the justification for pouring out large sum without a certain return wa the even greater cost of any real alternative .
the support for the express in 1912 provides for the introduction of â£50,000 or $60,000 to retain the only half-penny paper the party posse in london , and no le a sum than $700,000 to â£1 , 000,000 would be necessary to start a similar paper if the daily express were allowed to go .
the struggle therefore went on to keep the unionist press alive , and in 1912 and 1913 both aitken and northcliffe stood by the party and gave valuable support in their paper .
the coordination of competing party body wa carried out with surprising ease .
the national union wa merged with central office in 1911 and fusion with the liberal unionist followed in 1912 .
joseph chamberlain retained his preference for independence but allowed himself to be overruled by austen and by the overwhelming wish of the liberal unionist council to merge .
to cater for all susceptibility , the party became the national unionist association of conservative and unionist association â€” a decision that allowed some local party to go on calling themselves conservative , but the name liberal wa at last dropped .
the liberal unionist were admitted to the carlton club and a longstanding source of tension wa eradicated .
this wa in itself a striking commentary on what had already been done : liberal unionist who had resisted amalgamation under balfour and acland-hood in 1911 acquiesced meekly under law and steel-maitland in 1912 .
other organization could not be absorbed but could still be brought within the central office orbit .
so in 1911 steel-maitland offered to join the halsbury club in order to guide it on to safer line â€” and wa immediately accused of disloyalty by walter long .
long helped though by placing both steel-maitland and boraston on the executive committee of the union defence league for the same purpose .
steel-maitland also explained to lord robert cecil that it ha been arranged that the national conservative union should send out leaflet produced by several of the ancillary organization , such a the tariff reform league , the anti-socialist union , the primrose league , the london municipal society etc .
the central office attitude wa flexible , for outside body would always exist and could even be made use of :
they represent a time when either their object were not the same a those of the official organization , or the cco wa not enterprising enough to suit them .
but some caution should be observed .
it may be wise , while retaining or regaining control , to trade under different name .
in some case additional subscription may be obtained , in others full responsibility may be avoided .
with open ally like the primrose league , the case for collaboration wa strong ; for the first time in thirty year of existence the primrose league formally linked itself with the party in 1914 .
on the other hand , the independence of the tariff reform league wa a positive advantage : after january 1913 the party supported the tariff policy but wa not including them in it immediate programme , so that central office could continue to distribute tariff propaganda from the trl without compromising party policy .
in general , effort to ensure better coordination were a matter of the patient building up of contact , although the improved party morale and the greater efficiency of central office had removed their justification for existence .

steady current
3.1 .
the basic equation
in this chapter we shall be concerned with phenomenon in which the main role is played by the current of charged particle .
all our variable can be function of space but are independent of time .
it is easy to present the relevant equation ; we have all of eqns ( 1.1 ) -(1.7) but have to substitute a/at = o , yielding formula .
there is a difficulty with eqn ( 3.6 ) .
it is correct for most of the chapter with formula taken a a constant but break down for ferromagnetic material , which will be discussed in section 3.11 .
all the other equation are all right but will not necessarily provide the simplest starting point for solving a given problem .
we shall , therefore , introduce a number of alternative formulation .
first , we could search for some analogue of the potential function which proved so useful in electrostatics .
we found there that by choosing a scalar function in the form formula we could automatically satisfy the other equation for the electric field strength , formula .
can we do the same thing for the magnetic quantity ?
no , but we can do a similar thing .
since it is the equation formula that need to be satisfied , we should choose the potential a a vector ( called , not without logic , the vector potential ) , defined by the equation formula .
substituting the above equation into eqn ( 3.1 ) we get formula , or using the vector relation ( eqn ( a.6 ) ) we obtain the modified form formula .
this equation can be further simplified to formula by choosing ( in the physicist 's jargon this is called choosing the gauge ) formula .
can we do that ?
one ca n't usually assign some arbitrary value to the divergence of a vector function .
in the present case , however , we do have some freedom of choice .
the definition of a by eqn ( 3.8 ) is not unique .
if we add to a the gradient of a scalar function , the resulting vector a' still give the same magnetic field because formula .
hence a suitable choice of will ensure that formula .
so we are left with eqn ( 3.11 ) .
if the current density is specified , eqn ( 3.11 ) will provide the solution for a from which b can be determined .
how can we find a solution for a ?
there is nothing easier .
we only need to remember the differential equation for the scalar potential formula ( eqn ( 2.12 ) ) and it solution in the form of eqn ( 2.24 ) .
by analogy the general solution of eqn ( 3.11 ) is formula .
a simple integration will yield a if j is given .
we shall go through a number of example later .
for the moment let u use the above expression for deriving biot-savart 's law .
first we shall assume that the current density is confined to a thin wire in which case the integration variable may be changed to formula , where s is a vector normal to the cross-section , formula is the area of the cross-section , and di is an elementary vector along the tangent of the wire .
noting further that j.s = i and that i must be constant along the wire we may write eqn ( 3.15 ) in the modified form formula , whence the magnetic field strength is formula .
we have to stop here for a moment to sort out the coordinate .
a may be seen in fig. 3.1 the coordinate of the wire element are x' , y' , z' , whereas the coordinate of the point where we wish to determine the magnetic field are set of coordinate .
thus the curl operates on the coordinate of p but not on those of dl leading to formula where ir is the unit vector in the direction r and we have made use of the vector relation ( a3 ) in the appendix .
this is biot-savart 's law derived directly from maxwell 's equation .
are there any other way of determining the magnetic field ?
well , one can use eqn ( 3.1 ) a it is , but very often one is better off by using it integral form that can be obtained by integrating both side of eqn ( 3.1 ) over a surface formula .
by using stokes ' theorem for the left-hand-side and recognizing that the integral of the current density give the current , the above equation reduces to formula , where the line integration is along the curve c enclosing the surface .
the positive sense of the integration path is defined relative to the positive current direction according to the usual right-hand convention .
equation 3.21 ) is known a ampã¨re 's law .
we have now a number of equation describing the same thing .
which equation should we use in a practical case , the equation for the vector potential , ampã¨re 's law , biot-savart 's law , or attack directly maxwell 's equation ?
it 's hard to tell .
experience with practical calculation help , but even after year of work one usually remains this side of infallibility .
i regret to say that there are no general guideline available .
if one manages to find the simplest method at the first attempt that can mostly be attributed to good luck .
can we claim then that the vector potential is a useful a it scalar counterpart in electrostatics ?
for computational purpose the answer is an unambiguous no .
it is always laborious to find the component of a vector , so we are not much better off with a than with h or b. it turn out however that a is a more basic quantity of physic than b. since b is given by the curl of a it is possible that a is finite while it curl is zero .
interestingly , under these condition a ha an effect on certain quantum-mechanical phenomenon
it would be unfair both to the vector potential and to quantum mechanic to say that none of those formulation have engineering application ( in fact the most sensitive magnetometer built to date is based on that kind of theory ) , but by and large engineer would n't lose much sleep if the use of a were banned with immediate effect .
the vector potential is not a popular variable among engineer , maybe because it is not directly measurable .
there are no instrument capable to measure the magnitude or direction of a.
in my opinion a is a useful thing if used with moderation .
it helped u to derive biot-savart 's law , it will come handy later in solving certain radiation problem , and it often lead to nice formula , e.g. for the magnetic flux crossing a surface , defined a formula that may be rewritten in term of the vector potential a follows : formula where c is the curve enclosing the surface .
we have now collected a good number of formula which will serve u well in the following section .
before going on , just a few word about the classification of steady current .
it may be roughly divided into two part : magnetostatics and the rest .
we shall discus the rest first ( section 3.2â€“3.5 ) , and that will give u some idea of the relative significance of electric and magnetic field .
section 3.6â€“3.16 are concerned with magnetostatics , where electric field are assumed to be zero and the interrelationship of j , h , and b are studied .
since we have so many variable , and since in each physical configuration only some of them appear , we will record ( just for this chapter ) the non-zero variable in each section heading .
3.2 .
the defocusing of an electron beam ( j , e , d , p , h , b )
we have so far talked about positive and negative charge , about point charge , and distributed charge .
i shall now introduce the concept of an elementary charge , 1.6 ã— 10 -19 c , carried by an elementary particle called the electron .
this is not a necessity .
it is possible to study electromagnetic theory without ever mentioning the word electron , but since it ha become such a household word and is used so often we can just a well make use of it .
in the present section we shall consider a cylindrical electron beam of radius a in which the charge density is uniform ( p = po ) and all electron travel with velocity v.
we are not going to enquire into the detail how such beam can be produced ( it belongs to the subject of physical electronics ) ; we shall accept the fact that the beam exists and will try to work out the force on the outermost electron .
there is now cylindrical symmetry and a net charge per unit length formula , yielding for the radial component of the electric field formula .
the magnetic field may be obtained from ampã¨re 's law ( eqn ( 3.21 ) ) a follows formula , where the line integral is taken over the circle of radius a ( fig. 3.2 ) , i is the total current of the beam and formula is the azimuthal component of the magnetic field in the cylindrical coordinate system specified by formula] .
from eqn ( 3.26 ) we get formula] .
the electric force on an electron of charge e travelling at the edge of the beam ( r = a ) is it is in the radial direction pointing outwards .
the magnetic force is perpendicular both to the direction of motion ( +z axis ) and the direction of magnetic field ( formula] direction ) .
the vectorial product v x b give an inward force in the radial direction .
hence the net force on the electron is formula] .
noting that formula] and anticipating the relationship formula] to be derived in section 5.7 , we get the following formula for the force formula] , where c is the velocity of light .
it may be seen from the above equation that the magnetic force is negligible in comparison with the electric force unless the velocity of the electron approach the velocity of light .
thus the conclusion is that , owing to the repulsive force between the electron , a cylindrical electron beam is unstable .
using a technical term borrowed from electron optic we could say that the electron beam get defocused .
the other conclusion ( a far a it is permissible to generalize from a single example ) is more important in principle .
it is concerned with the relative magnitude of electric and magnetic force .
since charged particle rarely travel close to the velocity of light we may conclude that the magnetic force are by order of magnitude smaller than the electric force .
why is it then that we have no difficulty in practice in observing magnetic field ?
the reason is , of course , that there are two kind of electric charge and their effect usually cancel , so the small magnetic field ha a chance of getting observed .
and that brings u to the ext example .
3.3 pinch effect ( j , h , b )
in contrast to our previous example we shall now investigate a cylindrical beam consisting of two kind of charge carrier : negative electron and some positive particle , which i do not wish to be more precise about at the moment .
we shall assume that the two kind of particle have equal density and move in opposite direction .
a a result there is no net space charge and hence no electric field .
the current , on the other hand , do not cancel because they represent opposite charge moving in opposite direction ( remember , minus one time minus one is equal to plus one ) .
the magnetic field strength is given again by eqn ( 3.27 ) ; we only need to substitute for the current in + ip where the subscript n and p refer to negative and positive particle respectively .
hence the magnetic force on the electron at the edge of the beam ( at r = a ) is formula] , and on the positive particle is formula] .
note that the force is inwards , and in the same direction for both particle .
let u distinguish two case .
both particle are mobile
in that case both of them will move inwards under the effect of magnetic force .
but if the diameter of the beam is reduced , eqns ( 3.33 ) and ( 3.34 ) tell u that the force are even larger .
what happens then ?
if everything wa uniform then the beam diameter would go on decreasing .
in practice however the beam is not uniform and doe not posse perfect cylindrical symmetry .
under these condition the motion of the particle is fairly complicated , and of course our model is unable to predict the detailed behaviour of the particle .
nevertheless a few qualitative conclusion may be drawn without doing any further mathematics .
if the cross-section happens to be smaller at a certain place , then the force are larger there than at the neighbouring cross-sections , so the beam will be further constricted , etc. , leading to the so-called sausage instability ( fig. 3.3(a) ) .
if the magnetic field happens to be larger at one side than at the other side , then the beam will be deflected towards the weaker field which make the field even weaker , etc. , leading to the so-called kink instability ( fig. 3.3(b) ) .
the positive particle is immobile
in practice this mean that the positive ion are part of the crystal lattice .
there is then no magnetic force on the ion , only on the electron .
so the electron want to move inwards but can not because the ion hold them back by virtue of their electrostatic attraction .
naturally , if the ion attract the electron the converse is true a well , i.e. owing to the magnetic force on the electron , there is also an inward force upon the ion .
so the whole crystal structure try to contract or in other word the material is under pressure ( see example 3.2 ) .
in any practical situation this pressure is small and can be neglected when calculating the force on current-carrying conductor .
3.4 .
flow pattern and ohm 's law ( j , e , d )
up to now we have not enquired into the question of how the current arose .
we just assumed that certain charge carrier moved with certain velocity .
now we shall say that in a class of material the current density at any point is proportional to the electric field ; in mathematical form formula] , where formula] is the conductivity of the material .
the above equation is spite of it utmost simplicity represents an extremely good guess .
it is valid for nearly all material up to quite high electric field .
will there be a magnetic field ?
yes , of course , whenever there is a current there is a magnetic field a well .
but the effect of the magnetic field upon the motion of the electron is nearly always negligible ( one exception causing the pinch effect is mentioned in the previous section ) .
thus we may safely ignore the magnetic field when determining the line of current flow .
we are then left with only one equation formula] or formula] or formula] , depending on our preference .
eqn ( 3.38 ) tell u that there is some analogy ( see example 3.3 ) with the electrostatic case treated in chapter 2 .
we may , in fact , reinterpret any of the diagram of fig ( 2.25 ) -(2.31) by assuming that the whole space is filled with a material of conductivity formula] and the field line are now the line of current flow a well .
is the analogy perfect ?
not really , because ( 1 ) a current flow there is some potential drop in the electrode itself , ( 2 ) zero conductivity for part of the space can not be electrostatically modelled since there are no dielectric with er = 0 , and ( 3 ) when current flow through two material of different conductivity there is generally a surface charge at the boundary ( see example 3.4 ) .
it is not worth discussing any of these complication because one is rarely called upon to work out line of current in a conductor .
we shall rather return to a very simple geometrical configuration for deriving ohm 's law .
we shall take a piece of cylindrical material of length l and cross-section s and apply a voltage between the end .
the electric field is then formula] , the current density formula] , and the current formula] .
from circuit theory formula] , where r is the resistance of the material .
comparing eqns ( 3.41 ) and ( 3.42 ) we get formula] .
since formula] is by definition the resistivity we get the result you learned in school that the electrical resistance is proportional to the resistivity and the length of the sample and inversely proportional to it cross-section .
a more general definition of resistance valid for varying cross-sections may be easily arrived at , but it is hardly worth the trouble .
the essential thing is that the relation formula] is equivalent to ohm 's law .
risking the dismay of circuit engineer some theoretician do , in fact , refer to eqn ( 3.35 ) a ohm 's law .
prologue
post-impressionism : royal academy of art , london 1980
he signed the friend ' book in his elegant handwriting : alexander wedderburn , january 22nd , 1980 .
she had said , peremptory a always , that he wa to go straight to room iii , where the miraculous stuff wa to be found .
early .
so here he wa , a distinguished public man , also an artist of a kind , stepping obediently through room i ( french 1880s ) and room ii ( british 1880s and 1890s ) , on a lead grey morning , to the pale grey , classical , quiet place where the bright light shone and sang off pigment so that the phrase , miraculous stuff , seemed merely accurate .
on one long wall hung a row of van gogh , including an arles poet ' garden he had n't seen before , but recognised , from small photograph , from charged description in the painter 's letter .
he sat down and saw a bifurcated path , simmering with gold heat round and under the rising , spreading blue-black-green down-pointing vane of a great pine , still widening where the frame interrupted it soaring .
two decorous figure advanced , hand-in-hand , under it suspended thickness .
and beyond , green grass and geranium like splash of blood .
alexander wa not worried about whether frederica would turn up .
she wa no longer in the habit of being late : her life had schooled her to temporal accuracy , perhaps to being considerate .
he himself , at sixty-two , felt , not quite accurately , that he wa now too old , too settled , to be put out , by her or by anyone else .
he thought with warmth of her certain approach .
there had been a pattern , an only too discernible repetition in the event and relationship of his life into which she had ruggedly refused to fit .
she had been a nuisance , a threat , a torment and wa now a friend .
she had suggested that they look at van gogh together , setting up another form of repetition , deliberate , contrived and aesthetic .
his play , the yellow chair , had first been presented in 1957 ; he did not like to think too closely about it , a he did not like to think too closely about any of his past work .
he stared at the serenely impassioned garden made out of a whirl of yellow brushstrokes , a viridian impasto , a dense mass of furiously feathered line of blue-green , isolated black pot hook , the painfully clear orange-red spattering .
he had trouble finding an appropriate language for the painter 's obsession with the illuminated material world .
he would have been lying if he had recorded only the more accessible drama of the painter 's electric quarrel with gauguin in the yellow house in arles , the distant necessary brother who supplied paint and love , the severed ear delivered to the whore in the brothel , the asylum fear .
at first he had thought that he could write a plain , exact verse with no figurative language , in which a yellow chair wa the thing itself , a yellow chair , a a round gold apple wa an apple or a sunflower a sunflower .
sometimes he still saw the brushstrokes , a it were , in this naked way , so that his earlier thought of this garden had to be undone , the idea of black wing to be stripped from the painted leafage , the vulgar idea of blood splash washed off the notation of geranium .
but it could n't be done .
language wa against him , for a start .
metaphor lay coiled in the name sunflower , which not only turned towards but resembled the sun , the source of light .
van gogh 's idea of thing had also been against him .
the yellow chair , besides being brushstrokes and pigment , besides being a yellow chair , wa one of twelve bought for a company of artist who were to inhabit the yellow house , the white wall of which should blaze with sunflower a the window of gothic cathedral blazed with coloured light .
not only metaphor : cultural motif , immanent religion , a faith and a church .
one thing always linked to another thing .
a the poet ' garden , a decoration for the bedroom of the poet gauguin wa more than it seemed .
some time ago i read an article on dante , petrarch , boccaccio and botticelli .
good lord ! it did make an impression on me , reading the letter of those men .
arles , 1888 .
and petrarch lived quite near here in avignon , and i am seeing the same cypress and oleander â€¦
there is still a great deal of greece all through the tartarin and daumier part of this queer country , where the good folk have the accent you know ; there is a venus of arles just a there is a venus of lesbos and one still feel the youth of it , in spite of all â€¦
but is n't it true , this garden ha a fantastic character which make you quite able to imagine the poet of the renaissance strolling among these bush and over the flowery grass ? â€¦
the youth of it , alexander thought .
i thought i wa world-weary then .
in july 1890 , two year after writing this , van gogh had shot himself inefficiently in the groin , and had died slowly .
in 1954 alexander , a time-obsessed man , had read the centenary edition ( 1953 ) of the letter .
he had himself been rising thirty-seven and when the yellow chair wa put on had passed that age , wa older now than van gogh , a he had , in the 1940s , realised that he wa older than keats .
he had felt , perhaps , briefly , the power of the survivor .
what nonsense .
the eternal youth of provence .
he thought of thick , fat , hot motorway carving up that land .
he turned his attention to the timeless field of wheat and olive .
she made a kind of progress up the palladian marble stair .
a painter stopped to kiss her : a journalist waved .
john house , who had organised the exhibition , came almost leaping down the stair accompanied by a smallish woman in a pine-green tent-like coat .
he also kissed frederica and introduced the woman , fumbling her name , a a colleague and frederica a frederica â€” you must forgive me , i never know what name you re working under , woman these day are so protean .
frederica did not attempt to ascertain the fumbled name , having given up interest in stray new people until it wa clear that they were of real concern .
she assumed wrongly that john house 's colleague wa an art historian .
the colleague looked at frederica with an apparently absent-minded scanning attention .
john house spoke of the history of the gathering of the image , an emptiness here jacob wrestling the angel ) , an unexpected illumination there .
frederica listened attentively ; went on and signed the visitor ' book .
frederica potter , radio 3 critic ' forum .
she negotiated a free catalogue .
she made her leisurely way towards where she had told alexander to be .
an old woman , armed with a sound guide , became quite excited and pulled at the arm of another .
hey â€” look at that â€” winston churchill painted that , the â€¦ â€” carefully â€” cap d'antibes .
frederica dipped round her to stare : claude monet : au cap d'antibes par vent de mistral .
a whirl of blue and rose , for in le formed plungings of water and wind .
to paint , she remembered from proust 's description of fictive elstir , that one doe not see what one see .
to paint light and air between ourselves and object .
i said , dear , winston churchill â€” the second woman tugged free of the clutching finger .
not to be mentioned in the same breath with â€¦ she said , looking nervously from frederica to painted signature .
the arrested water shone and danced .
in the catalogue john house quoted monet 's description of the painted light around the snowy haystack a an enveloping veil .
he also quoted mallarmã© i think â€¦ that there should be only allusion â€¦
to name an object is to suppress three-quarters of the enjoyment of the poem , which is created by the gradual pleasure of apprehending it .
to suggest it , that is the dream .
it wa not a view of thing with which frederica wa entirely in sympathy : she liked naming name .
but she looked briefly down , dazzled by the flowing skin of worked and delicate colour ; the blue and rose tourbillons of the mistral on the sea , the prismatically sliced frosty nimbus round the mysterious squat stack .
she scribbled word , note , in the margin of her catalogue .
daniel bought a ticket , and paid for the hire of a catalogue , he wa n't sure why .
he had come , he believed , because he needed to discus certain administrative problem with frederica .
he wa aware that she believed he wa in need of art .
under his arm he carried a folded newspaper with that day 's headline : peace mother dy .
he wa raw to bad news , more raw a he grew older , which wa not perhaps quite what he had expected .
he saw and did not see the painting .
there wa a field of poppy and corn which reminded him only of small and large , faded and ghostly version of van gogh 's harvest which he had seen repeated in endless hospital corridor , waiting room , school office .
he had seen these ample field , a he had seen cezanne 's geometric brown and green undergrowth in more than one mental hospital day room .
odd , he thought , considering that van gogh himself had died mad and despairing in such surroundings .
not serene , overexcited , these field .
daniel 's patience with the nervously ill wa not what it had been .
although he wa fourteen year younger than alexander , daniel too wa in the habit of thinking of himself a a survivor , a battered and grizzled survivor .
alexander saw her coming towards him .
a dozen or so schoolgirl were dutifully filling in xeroxed , hand-written , one-word-answerable questionnaire .
alexander , always a connoisseur of garment , realised that frederica had changed her style , that the clothes the young creature were wearing could be described a a parody of the clothes frederica had worn at their age , and that frederica 's new style wa not unrelated to this shift .
there she wa in a conventional two-piece suit , fine dark wool , muted geometrical pattern in green and unexpected straw brown , caught in at the waist â€” still very thin â€” to give the effect of a bustle , the skirt long and straight to the knee .
she had ruffle ( not swashbuckling ) at the neck and the small velvet hat could , but did not , support a veil .
the pale red hair wa in a figure of eight chignon in her neck , reminiscent of one of toulouse-lautrec 's fine-drawn cafe habituã©es .
fifty and post-impressionist , thought alexander , connecting .
she came up and kissed him .
he remarked on the parody-young .
she took the point eagerly .
my dear , i know .
pencil skirt and batwing sweater and spiky stiletto , tottering with their hard little behind sticking out , and all that red lipstick .
i remember when i thought lipstick had gone forever , a dream of painted excess , a i thought paper taffeta had gone forever , in cambridge , when we all took to glazed cotton .
do you remember ?
of course .
do you remember the eclectic sixty parody â€” when we went to the national portrait gallery â€” everything , from swami to major-general and major-domo too .
these are such a serious and uniform parody .
more and more of the same .
more of me .
lã¨se-majestã© .
and you ?
you have reverted to type ?
oh , i 'm in my element .
i understand the fifty .
i could n't do the forty bit at all , padded shoulder and crãªpy thing , ugh , and pageboy â€” i think it must have been purely oedipal , those were my parent ' thing , dammit , what i wa getting away from .
this is my scene .
so it is .
and now i have money .
in our new austerity , you have money .
in our new austerity , i am old enough to have money .
they saw daniel advancing .
daniel doe n't change , said alexander .
sometimes i wish he did , said frederica .
daniel did not change .
he wore the same black clothes â€” baggy corduroy , heavy sweater , working-man 's jacket â€” that he had worn through the sixty and seventy .
like many hirsute men he had thinned a little on top where once his black fur had been extravagant , but he had a plentiful and prickling black beard , and his body wa still compact and very heavy .
he looked , in this setting , a little like some painter .
he saluted frederica and alexander with his rolled newspaper and said that it wa cold outside .
frederica kissed him too , reflecting that he wa dressed like a man who smelled dirty , but in fact did n't .
alexander smelled , still , of old spice and a sort of agreeable toastiness .
his smooth brown hair wa a thick a ever but shot now with needle of glittering silver .
we must talk , said daniel .
first you must look at the picture .
take time off .
i keep trying .
i went to the king 's carol service .
good for you .
frederica glanced shrewdly at him .
now , look at the picture .
gauguin 's man with the axe .
one for you , said frederica to alexander , still skimming the necessary accompanying print .
androgynous .
john house say .
no , gauguin said .
do you think ?
alexander considered the decorative gold body , itself a repetition of a body on the parthenon frieze .
he saw a blue loincloth , flat breast , purple sea with coral tracing lying flatly on it .
he wa unmoved , though the colour were rich and strange .
he told frederica he preferred his androgyne to be more obscured , more veiled , more suggested , and directed her attention to still-life , fete gloanec 1888 in which various inanimate object , two ripe pear , a dense bunch of flower , swam across a bright red table-top rimmed with a black ellipse .
the picture wa signed madeleine bernard , and alexander told frederica that gauguin had flirted seriously with that young woman , had characterised her , a wa fashionable at the time , a having the desirable , unattainable androgynous perfection , complete sensuality combined with unattainable self-sufficiency .
frederica informed him from the catalogue that the vegetation wa supposed to be a jocular portrait by gauguin of madeleine , the pear her breast , the dense flower her hair .
you could read it another way , said alexander , interested now , you could read the pear a androgynous in themselves , a partly male .
and the hair a other hair , said frederica loudly , scandalising a few bystander , amusing a few more .
you like to cork for your image , do n't you , alexander ?
it 's age , said alexander , peaceably , untruthfully .
they were beginning to attract a penumbra of gallery-goers , a though they were offering a guided tour .
they moved on to the olive picker .
daniel 's mind wa elsewhere .
he remembered a straight mass of red-gold hair , in cold king 's chapel , more golden than foxy frederica 's , slowly settling onto a collar a the pin released their grip .
he saw a mass of freckle â€” sometimes melding into sixpenny-sized brown patch of warmth â€” moving over the hard frame of cheekbone and brow .
the sexless voice rose in the cold .
unto u a boy is born .
herod then with wrath wa filled .
the voice played with the slaughter of the innocent , treble and descant hunting each other , while she bowed her head , unable to sing in tune .
the olive had been painted from the asylum at st rã©my in 1889 .
a for me , i tell you a a friend , i feel impotent when confronted with such nature , for my northern brain were oppressed by a nightmare in those peaceful spot a i felt one ought to do better thing with the foliage .
yet i did not want to leave thing alone entirely , without making an effort , but it is restricted to the expression of two thing â€” the cypress â€” the olive tree â€” let others who are better and more powerful than i reveal their symbolic language â€¦
look here , there is another question that come to mind .
who are the human being that actually live among the olive , the orange , the lemon orchard ?
frederica and alexander held a discussion of natural supernaturalism .
daniel looked at the pink sky , the twisted trunk , the silvery leaf , the rhythmic earth streaked with yellow ochre , with pink , with pale blue , with red-brown .
olive , frederica agreed with alexander , could not recall the mount of olive , the garden of gethsemane , in the day of van gogh the pastor 's son , the lay preacher .
a the cypress must always , differently , mean death .
daniel asked , for politeness really , why van gogh had been mad , wa it just that he wa driven ?
alexander said that it may have been a form of epilepsy , exacerbated by the atmospheric-electric disturbance of the mistral and the heat .
or you could make a freudian explanation .
he felt guilty towards the child who had not survived , for whom he had been named .
he had been born on march 30th 1853 .
his dead brother , vincent van gogh , had been born on march 30th 1852 .
he wa in flight from his family , his dead alter ego , his uncertain sense of identity .
he wrote to theo , i hope you are not a van gogh .
essentially i am not a van gogh .
i have always looked upon you a theo daniel said he could not see the pain frederica said wa in the olive , and alexander , still lecturing , said that vincent had objected to painting of symbolic christ in gethsemane by bernard and his compã¨res , had torn up his own , had made do with the olive themselves .
he told daniel about the terrible st rã©my painting of the blasted tree , about noir-rouge , and daniel said that it wa odd that these orchard should be all over the wall of other asylum now , to cheer people up .
the tree stood under their halo of pink and green stroke , small flying thing , solidified light movement or saccade of the eye , brushstrokes , pigment .
here is a description of a canvas which is in front of me at the moment .
a view of the park of the asylum where i am staying ; on the right a grey terrace and a side wall of the house .
some deflowered rose bush , on the left a stretch of the park â€” red-ochre â€” the soil scorched by the sun , covered with fallen pine needle .
this edge of the park is planted with large pine-trees , whose trunk and branch are red-ochre , the foliage green gloomed over by an admixture of black .
these high tree stand out against an evening sky with violet stripe on a yellow ground , which higher up turn into pink , into green .
a wall â€” also red-ochre â€” shuts off the view , and is topped only by a violet and yellow-ochre hill .
now the nearest tree is an enormous trunk , struck by lightning and sawed-off .
but one side branch shoot up very high and let fall an avalanche of dark green pine needle .
this sombre giant â€” like a defeated proud man â€” contrast , when considered in the nature of a living creature , with the pale smile of a last rose on the fading bush in front of him â€¦
to emile barnard , st rã©my , december 1889 .
you will realise that this combination of red-ochre , of green gloomed over by grey , the black streak surrounding the contour , produce something of the sensation of anguish , called noir-rouge from which certain of my companion in misfortune frequently suffer
i am telling you about this â€¦ to remind you that one can try to give an impression of anguish without aiming straight at the historic garden of gethsemane
daniel thought about dead ann maguire who , like anna van gogh , the dutch pastor 's wife , had named a younger , hopeful child for a dead one .
( though in van gogh 's case , the name , theodorus , vincent , vincent , theodorus , appeared and reappeared from generation to generation , the cultural parallel to certain persisting aspect of the family face , a heavy brow , an intense blue eye , a cheek bone , a nostril . )
in the churchyard in his last parish a family in the english 1870s had tried to name a son walter cornelius brittain and had buried three , aged five , aged two , aged one month , interspersed by variegated dead daughter , a jennet , a marian , an eva .
in august 1976 a car , containing an ira gunman , possibly already dead , ploughed onto a pavement and killed three of mr maguire 's child , joanne , eight , john , two , andrew , six week , leaving one son , mark , aged seven .
people had been shocked , by number a well a by gratuitous death itself , a people will be , and mr maguire 's sister and a friend had founded the peace people , whose brave beginning and sad end will not be chronicled here .
ann maguire had borne a second joanne , in new zealand , from where she had returned , unable to bear cultural transplantation .
although the paper referred to her a the peace mother she had not been active in the peace people .
she had brought a case for legal compensation for her dead child 's life and for her own suffering and one of her few recorded public utterance wa to call the first offer of compensation pitiful .
the day of the hearing of her second case she had been found dead .
daniel had pieced the story together from the radio : with throat wound .
foul play wa not suspected , and from conflicting newspaper .
with hedge-cutters .
with a carving knife .
with an electric carving-knife by her side .
her motif , the coroner wa to say , were not completely easy to understand .
daniel , who had become a specialist in wild blow of chance , thought he understood some of it .
he had not prayed for ann maguire .
he wa not that kind of priest .
he had metaphorically shaken a large fist , impotently , at some looming energy-field , and got on with his work , his work .
he followed the other two into the dark shadow of the room housing the low country .
nun ascended and descended a cool grey stair in winged white cap .
the lauriergracht in amsterdam wa gloomed and glittering .
mondriaan 's evening wa sombre and cloudy .
he liked these .
like vincent , although he wa unaware that vincent had remarked on it , he had northern brain and responded biologically and spiritually to tone of black , donkey-brown , varied grey , touch of white in dark .
one of the most beautiful thing done by the painter of this country ha been the painting of black which nevertheless ha light in it , vincent had written from holland .
xavier mellery , the painter of the nun , wa described in the catalogue a creating a light which is the negation of that which envelops our immediate visual experience of thing ; it is rather the interior light of your mind â€¦
daniel wa used to such language ; it wa his daily , or anyway weekly , pabulum .
he knew about the light shining in darkness , and had come , for reason completely different from alexander 's desire for exactness , specificity , to mistrust figurative language .
he never now made a sermon from a metaphor , nor drew analogy : he preached example , case , lesson .
but he liked the black dutch painting : they were , so to speak , on his wavelength .
he cornered frederica .
you said you 'd news of will .
a postcard , yes .
where this time ?
kenya .
on the way to the ugandan famine , i think .
hippie , said daniel .
helping out , said frederica .
what use â€” comparatively â€” is a chap like that , wi' no training , no medical â€¦ no â€¦ ?
another mouth to feed .
it make me wild .
i think he is often useful , in his way .
you judge him so he judge me .
judging run in the family .
it doe , said frederica .
once , said daniel , i wa in charing cross hospital , someone 's kid had taken an overdose and died , they pump them out there regular a clockwork but this one 's liver could n't take any more .
anyway , there i wa , going up this endless corridor , thinking what to do about the mother , who blamed herself â€” wi' reason mind you , she wa one of those soft suckering witch-women , but that made it worse , not better â€” and there wa th' trolley wi' the dead girl on it , sliding by me â€” sheet right over , porter in those soft theatre boot and floppy plastic bathcaps â€” and when they 'd got past me and were turning i n't door , the first one looked at me from under his plastic frill like , with my own face .
i wa shocked for a minute .
got all his hair tucked up in that thing , you see â€” otherwise , he 's not so like me , not strikingly so .
hi , he said .
going about your father 's business , are you ?
so i asked him what he wa up to and he said he wa going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down in it , and then he pushed th trolley in , and i went in after , and the mother began her howling and shrieking , and will said , well , i 'll walk off and leave you to it .
and i said , where are you going , then ?
and he said , i told you .
to and fro .
that wa the last i saw of will .
the nun ascended the stair in a perpetual cool silence .
quoting scripture for his own purpose , said daniel .
that wa rather funny , i thought , said frederica .
anything on the postcard about coming back ?
any plan ?
no .
sometimes she wished will would not write to her at all , if he would send no message to daniel .
sometimes she told herself the postcard , or exercise book scrawl , were message to daniel , but one should never , she considered , ignore surface meaning in favour of implication and the damned thing were addressed to her , to frederica .
oh hell , she said .
not to worry , said daniel .
i 'll push off .
i 'll see you .
you have n't seen the picture .
i 'm not in the mood .
we were going to have coffee in fortnum and mason 's .
no , thank you all the same .
wednesday , 12 january 1966
clare still swapped one night a week off with stephanie and reported subsequent event to gilda , who now managed the shoe shop : occasionally she visited clare for an evening meal .
a clare poured sherry , gilda asked , â€˜ so how wa the boac pilot ? â€™
â€˜ tony wa the worst yet . â€™
clare never felt embarrassed discussing sex with gilda , who could talk about little else .
â€˜ he 'd read all the sex manual ever printed .
whipped a porn magazine out of his flight case after the first gin and tonic .
he wa coldly determined to be a good lover .
for me , that wa a total turn-off . â€™
â€˜ porn picture are a turn-off to most woman .
woman like word , not picture , â€™ gilda said a she sipped her drink .
â€˜ but i 'm starting to think that everything 's a turn-off for you , doll .
you clearly ca n't have sex with fella you ai n't fond of .
i expect you need a chap you know well , someone you feel comfortable with , not these one-nighters . â€™
she swallowed half the glass .
â€˜ now me , i 'm the reverse .
if i do n't give a damn about â€˜ em , i ai n't anxious , and if i ai n't anxious , then i come easy . â€™
she drained her glass .
â€˜ when tony could n't get me to climax , he wanted to ask another girl over , â€™ clare said .
â€˜ he automatically assumed that i wa a lesbian . â€™
â€˜ that 's not what he meant , â€™ gilda said .
â€˜ lot of guy find it a turn-on to watch two woman making love . â€™
â€˜ how very odd .
can you imagine a woman trying to get two men into bed so she could watch them ? â€™
â€˜ forget this guy , â€™ said gilda .
â€˜ i know what you need , clare : someone you know and trust , someone who wo n't make you feel anxious .
then you 'll relax and it 'll happen â€” then you 'll stop being one of them miserable nympho who hop from man to man , hoping for mr right , the man who can satisfy her . â€™
a gilda held out her glass to be refilled , she added reflectively , â€˜ although you seem more lonely than horny .
are you looking for sex , or just someone to talk to ?
you ai n't likely to pick up prince charming in a bar . â€™
clare said , â€˜ i 'm not looking for prince charming .
i do n't want the disorder , the pain , the mess , or the misery of being in love .
i just want a short-term relationship , without responsibility . â€™
gilda laughed .
â€˜ so do these fella you pick up .
but i 'm not convinced that 's right for you .
you need a secure situation with someone you can trust , who you know will stick around because he love you .
i 'll tell you who you ought to fall in love with , clare . â€™
â€˜ who ? â€™
â€˜ yourself .
you clearly think that you 're a piece of worthless rubbish , and if i pick up those vibe , then so do the bloke .
why not give sex a rest for a bit , and pay a bit of attention to yourself ?
you never want to make a man the centre of your existence .
that place is for you , clare . â€™
â€˜ i am the centre of my existence , â€™ clare sang , a if chanting a psalm , pitching her voice an octave lower , a she pushed josh to her playgroup the next morning .
a man stood on the porch , his hand in the pocket of his beige mackintosh .
â€˜ good morning .
are you a prospective parent ? â€™
clare asked .
she felt in her pocket for the key .
â€˜ no. â€™ said the man .
i 'm an inspector for the local education authority . â€™
after examining the bathroom , the inspector pointed out that legally one toilet wa required for every seven kiddy .
clare said , â€˜ but if each child go there every two and a half hour , one lavatory is adequate .
there is a potty for emergency .
we have never had a problem . â€™
the inspector wa not listening .
he wa making note on other violation .
half an hour after the inspector left , a if to prove his point , the lavatory refused to flush .
the following morning , clare 's playgroup wa ordered to close .
two day later , clare 's mind wa unexpectedly diverted from her personal problem â€” no job , no man â€” when the cnd office telephoned to ask her for voluntary evening help : they were organizing another protest after a nuclear accident .
over spain , an american b-52 bomber carrying an h-bomb had collided in mid-air with another aircraft .
the h-bomb , with an explosive capacity of more than a million ton of tnt , had fallen into the atlantic ocean off southern spain .
clare felt cheered to be back among like-minded people , doing something worth while .
monday , 14 february 1966
valentine 's day brought two happy event .
the radio reported that the missing h-bomb had been located on the atlantic seabed .
and to clare 's delight , she sold the lease of the apartment in which she ran her playgroup â€” for a profit of twenty-three per cent .
clare felt a if she had won a sweepstake .
on the following morning , she bought a portable tv , a warm winter coat for herself , and new clothes for josh .
she did n't buy any toy for josh because she had decided to open a toy shop .
two week later , clare bought the short lease of a small shop in the pimlico road , close to mr gooden 's home .
though there wa a lot to do , clare , busy redecorating the shop and visiting wholesaler to buy stock , still managed to work one evening a week for the movement .
in mid-april , just before her toy shop opened , clare 's weary , amiable , national health doctor looked up from his desk and said , â€˜ about your vaginal symptom , mr shapiro .
you 'd better go to st stephen 's for test : they 're properly equipped to handle this sort of thing . â€™
he seemed uneasy .
â€˜ what sort of thing ? â€¦
not â€¦ cancer ? â€™
â€˜ no , gonorrhoea , â€™ the doctor said apologetically .
clare almost fainted from surprise and anxiety , horror and shame .
then she wept .
the doctor refused to give her more sleeping tablet but scribbled a prescription for tranquillizer , which were increasingly prescribed for woman like clare , with symptom of anxiety in stressful situation such a poverty , divorce , or bereavement ; woman with marital problem and woman who were out of work also found them helpful , although the pill did nothing to resolve the problem responsible for the initial anxiety .
clare , who blushed with shame whenever she thought about it , waited anxiously for the result of her test at st stephen 's hospital .
the test were negative .
but within a month , she could n't get through the day without tranquillizer ; she felt le anxious , calmer .
clare managed to open the red rocking horse by mid-may .
at the opening party , an excited three-and-a-half-year-old josh rode the pretty antique red rocking horse in the shop window .
monday , 15 august 1966
standing by the swimming pool at saracen , miranda beckoned to adam , who wa floating on the water in a transparent blow-up plastic armchair .
in a voice of soft persuasion , she said , â€˜ will you do something for me , adam ?
i 'm going to learn to fly .
i want you to break the news gently to gran . â€™
â€˜ but you promised your grandmother not to learn to fly , â€™ adam objected .
â€˜ it wa a condition of her gift to you the ten thousand pound â€™ capital to start kit . â€™
i did n't say for ever .
i 'll pay the money back to her . â€™
miranda wa defiant .
â€˜ i 've always wanted to fly .
i wo n't be held by a promise that wa unfairly extracted from me before i legally became an adult .
and i get bored with nothing to do on holiday but lie in the sun . â€™
â€˜ when are you starting ? â€™
adam asked , resigned .
â€˜ this morning , at the cannes flying school .
they have english instructor .
four hour of instruction a day for two week .
and of course , this time of year , it 's perfect flying weather ! â€™
miranda wa triumphant now .
â€˜ i 've already passed the two written exam .
did law and meteorology last easter , and now i 've finished navigation , radiotelephony , and technical â€” that wa the toughest . â€™
so that 's why you 're so pale . â€™
three hour later , two thousand foot above the mediterranean , miranda , alert and exultant , sat next to her instructor at the control of a trainer plane , an ugly little single-engine rallye which her instructor described a efficient and forgiving : you could do something wrong m a rallye without getting immediately punished for it .
flying wa even better than she had hoped : better than skiing , better than driving a sport car .
a the rallye droned towards the lighthouse on the tip of cap camerat , miranda felt a if she were breathing the air of the god .
gently they swooped , turned , and climbed in the azure sky .
after they reached two thousand foot , the instructor showed her how to fly level ; he then encouraged her to experiment with the stick , manoeuvring the plane m every direction .
miranda felt that the aircraft wa an extension of her arm and her fingertip , outspread in flight .
heading west on the return flight path , the instructor said , â€˜ this is the first time i 've flown with a pupil and have n't once needed to touch the control . â€™
miranda pushed home this advantage .
â€˜ then can i land ? â€™
the instructor hesitated , then said , â€˜ why not ? â€™
the girl wa clearly a natural flyer .
after being given clearance to land , miranda , following her instructor 's direction , started her approach ; she throttled back to reduce speed and control her descent a she flew towards the threshold â€” the point just before she intended to touch down .
the plane wa now moving at not much above stalling speed .
a the rallye dropped to about thirty foot above the runway , miranda throttled back completely and held the stick back .
the plane seemed to glide forward and land itself .
the undemonstrative miranda flung her arm around the instructor .
â€˜ oh , thank you !
thank you !
â€˜ quite a smooth landing , â€™ the instructor said approvingly he hesitated , then warned , â€˜ next time be careful not to land too fast or you 'll run out of runway . â€™
this woman wa adventurous and ambitious : such pilot did not live long .
he added , â€˜ careful pilot are the one that survive .
a good pilot never take a risk . â€™
â€˜ the opposite of a good businessman , â€™ miranda said , still on a high .
â€˜ a businessman ha to take risk constantly â€” and win sixty per cent of the time . â€™
â€˜ in the air , that risk factor would kill you . â€™
nine hundred year earlier , the great hall had been the hub of castle life : wolfhound ate on floor strewn with rush ; servant slept on straw pallet thrown on the floor .
then , the winter salon did not smell of lily and expensive leather but of stale , fat , stinking human body and animal ordure .
elinor sometimes thought of all the love and the hatred , the treachery and the killing that this hall had undoubtedly seen , when strong men fought hand-to-hand to the death , to protect their woman and child .
now the winter salon at saracen , where elinor waited for adam , wa not only the coolest but the most impressive room in the chã¢teau .
high arched wall of pale , honey-coloured stone were hung with bluish-green tapestry ; around the big stone fireplace , where log burned in winter , stood sofa covered in the blue and green of the tapestry ; here and there were lamp , flower , book , and pile of parlour game .
â€˜ what 's keeping adam ? â€™
elinor asked buzz , who wa adding up the scrabble score .
â€˜ you said three o'clock .
it 's only two-thirty , â€™ buzz said .
â€˜ ninety-three for you , two hundred and sixty-four for me .
that 's not a bad score for you , nell . â€™
buzz never cheated to let elinor win : she knew that elinor would immediately sense this and feel humiliated .
after an intensive rehabilitation programme of physiotherapy and speech therapy , elinor appeared to have completely recovered from her stroke , although she could no longer think of three thing at once , which buzz said wa a mercy for the people who had to live with her .
elinor wa sometimes at a loss for the right word , or name , and then became impatient with herself ; she wa often frustrated because she could n't move a swiftly a she did before .
at time , she wa downhearted and wondered whether she would ever write another book .
â€˜ when you want to write , you 'll write , â€™ buzz would tell her then .
now buzz grunted , â€˜ look what i tore out of the daily mail . â€™
she dug into her pocket , unfolded a bit of newspaper , and read , sportsman jim clark today opened a splendidly equipped physical training college at larkwood in wiltshire , formerly the family home of the o'dare family .
lady o'dare commented , â€˜ i wish them well . â€™ â€™
â€˜ i doubt that . â€™
elinor peered at the photograph of the new owner , a motor-racing hero , standing with her sister-in-law , marjorie .
the doorbell sounded .
â€˜ i 'll go , â€™ buzz said .
â€˜ it 's either adam or the postman . â€™
buzz returned reading a postcard .
â€˜ it 's for you , from sonia rushleigh â€¦
whoop , i mean bromley .
who 'd have thought them two would marry ?
she say the colonel 's taken up petit point , and miss hawkins is teaching him .
remember her , the schoolmistress ? â€™
â€˜ i do indeed , â€™ said elinor .
â€˜ frumpy sourpuss !
who 's the letter from ? â€™
â€˜ clare . â€™
buzz held the envelope out to elinor .
elinor shook her head .
â€˜ you open it . â€™
â€˜ it 's marked personal . â€™
â€˜ i do n't want to read it , unless she apologizes . â€™
buzz opened the letter and read it .
she shook her head .
â€˜ it 's just a friendly letter , asking how you are .
but reading between the line , i think clare need money . â€™
â€˜ if she took her poor child back to his father and gave her husband a second chance , she would n't need money . â€™
â€˜ how about a bit of generosity ? â€™
buzz said .
â€˜ you 're a silly , stubborn old woman .
and clare 's just a stubborn and just a silly .
it would n't have hurt her to say she wa sorry . â€™
elinor looked anxious .
â€˜ do you really think she 's short of money , buzz ?
i would n't want her to have a rough time . â€™
this remark wa overheard by adam a , in pale blue shirt and jean , he sauntered through the door .
he said , â€˜ elinor , you allowed ample provision in the trust for helping clare â€” if the trustee consider that help is needed .
i 'll check on clare when i get back to london . â€™
he put a pile of paper on a side table .
â€˜ there 's rather a lot of paperwork here , thing that you should be aware of . â€™
â€˜ we 've had more paperwork , not le , since the trust took over , â€™ buzz said tartly .
â€˜ and i tell you frankly that i ca n't follow it , adam .
i thought the trustee were going to manage the business .
elinor should n't be made to wade though page of paragraph with no comma in â€˜ em . â€™
â€˜ of course the trustee manage the business , and they do it very well , â€™ adam said .
â€˜ and there 's no reason for elinor to see any of this if it tire her .
in fact , i 'm about to suggest something that would simplify matter . â€™
â€˜ what 's that ? â€™
buzz asked .
â€˜ i 'd like to substitute paul littlejohn for myself in the power of attorney that i hold on your behalf , elinor .
i 'm trying to reduce the number of business administrator : the fewer there are , the simpler the system and the cheaper it will be . â€™
â€˜ doe that mean that paul will be legally responsible for elinor 's affair instead of you , adam ? â€™
â€˜ yes , but that 's only a technicality .
paul will do a i say .
and i 'd also like you to sign this document , adam added , â€˜ which absolves me and stg from any further responsibility once paul littlejohn ha been substituted . â€™
buzz said , â€˜ but surely â€¦ â€™
smoothly adam explained , â€˜ the responsibility must clearly rest m only one area .
it 's in your interest to clarify the situation .
it 's customary . â€™
â€˜ if you think that 's best , adam dear . â€™
elinor frowned slightly at buzz .
adam decided to hold back miranda 's bombshell until later , after elinor drank her evening glass of champagne .
just before five o'clock , when the business session had ended and the afternoon wa still hot , quiet , and heavy with languor , buzz left to get some tea .
adam escorted elinor to the elevator ; after taking her to her bedroom , he intended to go to the beach for a swim .
in the high-ceilinged kitchen , surrounded by the smell of mint and basil , buzz whistled â€˜ rose of picardy â€™ with much dramatic warbling a she prepared elinor 's tea .
leaf and yellow blossom obscured the top of the window , while the bottom wa covered by aggressive pink hollyhock , seemingly determined to fight their way inside .
sylvie , the cook , sat at the big kitchen table by the window , writing a list and shooing pigeon away .
the bane of sylvie 's life wa the pigeon droppings that littered the windowsill and had to be cleaned up daily .
with a shudder , sylvie refused a cup of tea .
still whistling , buzz laid the tray .
the soporific calm of the drowsy afternoon wa shattered by the bell indicator above the kitchen door .
someone wa jabbing the bell â€” non-stop â€” in elinor 's bedroom .
knowing that adam wa probably in the elevator on his way to the beach , buzz hurled herself out of the kitchen and ran upstairs .
frantically she tore open the door to elinor 's apartment .
in the passage , she stumbled and almost fell , then flung back the door to the bedroom .
to her relief , elinor wa not slumped on the floor ; deathly white , she clung for support to the silver brocade hanging of her bed .
wordlessly , she pointed above the fireplace .
buzz turned her head to the left , where the portrait of the three sister hung .
at first buzz saw nothing , but then she gasped in horror .
each of the three long , creamy neck had been cut horizontally : a small triangle of canvas hung downward from each slashed throat .

wednesday , 17 august 1966
in the foyer of the clanrickard club , mike grant leaned against the wall at the bottom of a double-sided curving staircase .
with his hand in the pocket of his dinner jacket , he surveyed the room .
it wa going to be a good night , in spite of the fact that it wa august and a wednesday .
making sure to appear casual , he carefully watched the men in dinner jacket and the woman in full-length dã©colletã© dress move slowly over the red carpet towards the restaurant at the rear , or climb the staircase to the gaming room .
mike noticed a group of heavy gambler , most of them greek , move towards the baccarat room , where the sultan of rupolei had been losing for the last hour .
his attention wa also caught by a woman dressed in midnight-blue satin and diamond ; the sister of a middle-eastern ruler , she wa known a an audacious gambler .
he stiffened a he recognized a man move upstairs with a distinctive , boneless saunter : he had better send someone up to check the backgammon room .
the club owner , the casino , and the multinational bookmaker knew which professional gambler successfully played game that contained an element of skill â€” such a backgammon and poker- and they preferred to have nothing to do with them ; ideally , the house welcomed inexperienced , rich idiot .
â€˜ this is certainly a good night to play the odds . â€™
mike heard a sarcastic voice from behind him .
he turned and smiled at adam .
â€˜ come into my office for a drink .
what 's up ? â€™
in mike 's office , furnished with heavily varnished victorian club furniture .
adam shook his head curtly at the offer of a chair .
â€˜ i 'm not staying , â€™ he said .
â€˜ i merely wanted to tell you that you 've scared the hell out of everyone at saracen â€” except me .
so kindly curb your theatrical , james bond streak .
i knew immediately what your message meant : â€˜ if you do n't pay up , one slash is all it take . â€™ â€™
he glared at his brother .
â€˜ i thought you were fond of elinor .
i seem to recall that elinor helped you to buy your first good bike .
why drag her into my problem ?
you might have given her another stroke . â€™
â€˜ i do n't know what the hell you 're talking about , and i ca n't comment until i do . â€™
mike , his face alert and wary , lit a cigarette .
adam briefly described how the triple portrait had been slashed and added , â€˜ d' you really expect me to believe that you had nothing to do with it ?
someone told some cat burglar where to find that picture ! â€™
mike stared at his brother , then slowly said , â€˜ not me .
i agree , it 's clearly a warning to pay , but i swear i know nothing about it .
it could n't have been the brother â€” they 'd be even le subtle â€¦ â€™
he inhaled deeply .
â€˜ who else do you owe money , adam , you stupid bastard ? â€™
â€˜ no one who 'd do anything so bloody childish !
how do i stop this bloody nonsense ? â€™
â€˜ how many time must i tell you that if you let thing go too far , nobody can stop what will undoubtedly happen ?
adam , â€™ mike went on quietly , â€˜ you 've always taken full advantage of anyone who 's fond of you .
you think you can push me around because you 've been doing that since we were in the nursery .
you also grew up watching grandfather 's client literally get away with murder . â€™
he sucked on his cigarette , furiously threw it into the fireplace , shoved his hand in his pocket , and glared at adam .
â€˜ do you want to be found washed up on the seashore with a few vital bit missing ?
are you so anxious to know what it feel like to have both eyeball gouged out , one at a time ?
do you want to be slowly battered to death , before dying in agony ? â€™
â€˜ of course not , you bastard , â€™ adam said .
â€˜ i only want to know who slashed that picture if you did n't . â€™
â€˜ whoever they are â€” and only you know that â€” these people are serious .
punter often try to avoid paying .
example often have to be made .
you know that . â€™
mike started to stride up and down the room .
â€˜ take that fucking urbane look off your face and face reality , adam .
if you lose money , that 's tough .
but if you do n't pay up , that 's insanity . â€™
â€˜ i 've had enough of your melodrama , â€™ adam snarled .
mike glared at his brother again .
â€˜ i 'm not exaggerating .
remember that incident when the sultan 's sister had her roll stopped , at two in the morning on the grande corniche , after leaving the casino ?
they blew away the chauffeur 's head with a machine gun .
she wa n't touched .
she paid all her gambling debt the very next day .
and when the story wa carefully leaked to the newspaper , quite a lot of other debt were suddenly settled in full . â€™
â€˜ i 'm not some goddamned sultan 's sister . â€™
â€˜ no , but you also like playing with fire .
you never believe that the god will really let it burn you .
you think you 're omnipotent â€” but you are n't . â€™
â€˜ keep your voice down , â€™ adam growled .
â€˜ i 'll do what i bloody well like in my own office , â€™ mike said .
â€˜ do n't you understand ?
i 'm on your side , adam .
you 're the only brother i have . â€™
his voice deepened .
â€˜ i 'm probably more worried about this than you are .
if anything happened to you â€¦
i 'd be left without you .
so for god 's sake , pay up , you stupid shit !
do n't think you can get away with it just because you 've always got away with everything , since you set that nursemaid 's apron alight . â€™
â€˜ i thought you were too young to remember that , â€™ adam said uneasily .
he added , â€˜ she should n't have left the match within reach of a child . â€™
â€˜ she wa in hospital for six week , and i wa the only one who knew it wa n't an accident .
i knew you wanted to see how far you could go . â€™
â€˜ let's not argue about something that happened over thirty year ago , â€™ adam said finally .
â€˜ can you raise money to help me fend them off ?
i promise you .
within six month i know i 'll have no more money problem .
never again . â€™
â€˜ you 'll have money problem a long a you gamble , adam .
annabel wa determined to get a grip on herself and do a scott advised : remember 1965 a the year she stopped having to go to audition and 1966 a the year in which she blossomed into a successful young new york hostess a she met andy warhol , lenny bernstein , baby jane holzer , and all the other gossip-columnist fodder .
by july , annabel wa a junior friend of the metropolitan museum , a friend of the museum of modern art , and a patron of the bronx zoo .
she also allayed her insecurity with a massive spending spree ; each charity dinner required a new ballgown , and each new glittering friend â€” contact for scott â€” required a glittering party .
so the year thus far wa a busy one .
the long road home
cia hq langley
sorge had never been to langley before .
it wa not something a russian expected to do .
it wa after 9 a.m. when nowak drove him through the gate , past the guard , and into the vast underground car-park .
â€˜ why langley ? â€™
sorge had asked him on the way out of washington .
â€˜ they want to show you that they trust you . â€™
â€˜ i do n't expect i 'll see much . â€™
nowak laughed .
â€˜ damn right .
we park in the underground car-park , catch a special lift to the fifth floor and walk across the corridor into a special conference room . â€™
â€˜ that 's trust ? â€™
â€˜ that 's trust . â€™
the executive director wa already in the meeting room .
â€˜ welcome to langley . â€™
he held his hand out in welcome .
when the introduction were complete , the exec director , the dda , the ddi , sorge and nowak settled themselves round the small conference table .
â€˜ we have a new problem , â€™ kicked off the exec director .
â€˜ the english operative who wa guarding trimmler ha taken off .
he 's also taken an agent of ours with him .
a hostage .
a woman .
we believe they 're still in new orleans . â€™
â€˜ why ? â€™ asked sorge , concerned .
â€˜ i do n't know yet .
what about goodenache ? â€™
he decided to turn the pressure on the russian .
â€˜ he caught a flight to frankfurt .
he hired a car , but the car wa found abandoned on the outskirt of frankfurt .
we are trying to find our missing scientist now . â€™
â€˜ are the german authority involved ? â€™
â€˜ no .
we have our own mean . â€™
sorge saw the exec director look up , his eyebrow raised suddenly .
â€˜ we both have our method .
even in an independent germany .
after all , it wa the death of our people in these situation that ha brought u together . â€™
the exec director shrugged .
bastard russian were still upm_to their old trick .
he ignored the pointed look the ddi wa giving him .
â€˜ i thought it best if the director of our operation in new orleans gave you a run down of what ha taken place up to now . â€™
he sat back and let the dda give a full report , including the trip to the voodoo ceremony and all that followed .
sorge did n't stir , even when they mentioned the gruesome spectacle of trimmler 's arm folded in the sign of a swastika .
â€˜ we still are n't convinced that trimmler 's death ha anything to do with the death of our agent .
there 's no definite link . â€™
â€˜ the situation might be clearer when i 've finished . â€™
sorge looked round the table , saw their undisguised curiosity .
â€˜ in 1942 , in germany , we had a gru network named the rote kapelle â€¦ â€™
â€˜ what 's that ? â€™ asked the exec director .
â€˜ red orchestra .
the nazi called it that because we had radio operator we code-named musician .
their leader , the chef , we called him , wa leopold trepper .
it wa this group that radioed the warning of operation blue , the attack on stalingrad that led to hitler 's biggest wartime disaster on the russian front . â€™
â€˜ who wa feeding you all this information in germany ? â€™ asked the exec director .
â€˜ high-ranking official .
both in the military and in the government .
they saw the damage hitler wa doing .
they did n't disagree with his aim , only his method .
when they saw that the war could not be won , even a early a 1941 , some of them opened up line of communication with u and the british . â€™
â€˜ we did n't get that sort of stuff till late into 1944 , â€™ said the dda .
â€˜ you were n't european .
we had century of contact to fall back on .
for all their bravery and resourcefulness , their information wa often wasted , because stalin did n't believe them .
but then , he found it difficult to believe anyone .
the german , with more sophisticated radio-tracking equipment , started to track down the musician .
even trepper wa captured and the rote kapelle wa wound up at the end of 1942 .
our information continued for a while , but it wa of doubtful origin .
trepper wa interrogated by the gestapo and we believed he became a double agent , a lot of misinformation wa received in moscow . â€™
sorge leant across and finished his coffee before continuing .
â€˜ but we still needed information .
the overall network with source inside germany wa the rote drei . â€™
â€˜ the red what ? â€™ said the exec director , pleased that he had deciphered the first word of the new code-name .
â€˜ three .
the red three .
based in switzerland and named after the three transmitter that they used .
the most important source of information , from agent inside germany , wa from a group under rudolf roessler .
his code-name wa lucy and his network , the lucy ring .
roessler , or lucy , wa a swiss intelligence officer of german extraction .
he had many contact in germany .
lucy 's four main contact were major general oster who wa the head of the abwehr ; admiral canaris who wa later hanged for his part in the 1944 bomb plot ; carl goehdeler who wa leader of the official opposition to hitler ; and colonel boetzel , the commanding officer of intelligence evaluation .
there were others , but lucy never disclosed any of them to u . â€™
â€˜ even after the war ? â€™ asked the ddi .
â€˜ the lucy ring wa disbanded in 1943 , after being responsible for some invaluable work .
i wo n't go through all their success , but it wa substantial .
the british were involved with them through u and it wa their advanced work on breaking cypher that enabled the ring to establish such a great record .
but the ring disbanded , once more because of stalin 's penchant for secrecy , after moscow tried to bypass roessler and go direct to his number two . â€™
â€˜ so , where 's the link ? â€™ interrupted the dda , impatient a ever .
â€˜ it 's important you understand the background , â€™ said sorge , not allowing the american to get under his skin .
â€˜ nothing further came from the ring until the last few week of the war .
with the ally advancing on the eastern and western front , many high-ranking german were out to save their own neck .
the lucy ring wa reactivated , this time without the knowledge of the british . â€™
â€˜ or the american , â€™ commented the exec director .
â€˜ i suggest you take that up with comrade stalin , â€™ replied sorge drily .
â€˜ it wa an impressive list .
they did n't just have knowledge .
they also had wealth .
in all form .
art , cash , in every form possible .
they used the ring because of their line into switzerland .
they wanted the security of the swiss bank and the russian bear .
one wa dependent on the other . â€™
â€˜ so they bought immunity .
while our boy were still getting killed , â€™ snapped the ddi .
â€˜ a were ours , â€™ snapped back sorge .
â€˜ but your hand were n't that clean .
you were bringing scientist and others into america just a we were .
scientist with nazi record , scientist with a history of brutality , war criminal . â€™
â€˜ gentleman , please , â€™ said nowak , ever the diplomat .
â€˜ can we just stick to what we 're here to discus ?
go on , dimitri . â€™
sorge wa annoyed with himself , irritated that he had allowed the intelligence man to get under his skin .
â€˜ of course , â€™ he smiled back .
â€˜ now â€¦ ah , yes â€¦ we used the lucy ring .
many german , with their prize , crossed safely into switzerland .
they came in car , army lorry , even an aeroplane .
their rich were stored in the bank under private account and then they were brought through czechoslovakia and east germany into the soviet union . â€™
â€˜ all of them ? â€™ asked the dda .
â€˜ those who broke their word were hunted down . â€™
â€˜ and disposed of ? â€™
â€˜ some needed reminding that we expected them to honour their word . â€™
it wa a cold reminder of their world , of the business they traded in daily .
â€˜ we had a large colony of nazi living in the soviet union .
they were n't all scientist , in fact we had little use for most of them .
they had their own estate and farm to the west of moscow .
they kept their secret identity and paid for it through their swiss bank account .
but they remained german , always dreaming of going back to the fatherland one day . â€™
â€˜ how many nazi did you take to russia after the war ? â€™
â€˜ the narodnyi kommissariat vnutrennikh del , our people 's commissariat for internal affair , wa responsible for â€” â€™
â€˜ i never heard of them , â€™ the dda stopped him .
â€˜ nkvd , â€™ explained the ddi patronizingly .
â€˜ wiped out twenty million russian for stalin .
that right ? â€™ he challenged sorge .
â€˜ more .
thirty million .
according to official source , â€™ sorge riposted .
â€˜ a most useful organization . â€™
that should shut them up .
he felt the look of disbelief pas between the exec director and the dda .
the other just watched him , the mocking smile still on his lip .
he would be the one rostov had warned him to be wary of .
he decided to wipe the smile off his face .
â€˜ thirty thousand .
that 's how many east german we deported into the soviet union after the war . â€™
the ddi 's smile disappeared .
â€˜ thirty thousand nazi ?
jesus . â€™
â€˜ yes .
and we kept another hundred and twenty thousand between 1945 and 1954 in hitler 's old concentration camp .
many were nazi , but businessmen and professional were also our target .
a third of those died .
the others were eventually released and absorbed into the democratic republic . â€™
â€˜ including nazi sympathizer ? â€™
â€˜ probably . â€™
â€˜ doe n't that concern you ? â€™
sorge shrugged .
â€˜ not really .
i wa eight year old at the time . â€™
it wa n't the answer that the ddi expected and sorge regretted his word .
he wa n't here to make joke .
â€˜ the thirty thousand in the soviet union , a i said , became a community in their own right .
without our knowledge , over the year , with the use of their money and supportive people in the swiss bank , they forged contact with those left behind in east germany .
they all had one dream .
to see a unified germany .
to regain what they had lost .
they had a code-name amongst themselves .
something that linked them , wa a reminder of how they had got there .
it had to be a safe name , innocuous , nothing that would draw attention to the past .
they remembered the lucy network , their gateway out of germany .
they called themselves die lucie geister . â€™
â€˜ the lucy ghost . â€™
â€˜ yes . â€™
â€˜ did the organization extend to america ? â€™
the exec director wa alarmed .
how the hell did they â€¦
â€˜ goodenache .
i guess he wa one of them ? â€™ asked the ddi .
â€˜ we were n't sure , but in view of his sudden departure , i would say yes . â€™
â€˜ which tie trimmler in .
and god know who else .
the name grob mitzer mean anything ? â€™
â€˜ he wa one of their leader .
it wa the lucy ghost who supplied him with the cash that helped him build his empire . â€™
â€˜ why did n't you stop it ?
damn it , you knew about it for long enough , â€™ snapped the exec director .
â€˜ we did n't realize how important it wa .
we thought they were like any other wartime group , nothing more than reminiscence and marching song .
old men remembering their youth .
the importance of it did n't surface until germany wa reunified .
and it wa only the englishman overhearing the conversation between goodenache and trimmler that finally bridged the gap . â€™
â€˜ so why should the english guy take off with the girl ? â€™
the ddi changed the subject .
â€˜ he 's not one of u .
i suggest you ask your ally about that .
maybe he 's just an adventurer .
no more .
you must have cleared him . â€™
â€˜ of course . â€™
the exec director did n't want his dirty washing wrung out in front of this russian .
â€˜ wa there anything else ? â€™
â€˜ only that the gdr , east germany , a it wa , is different to the west .
there are still many there who have n't forgotten the war .
their attitude is different to u .
some are still waiting for the war to end .
they 're a traditional people .
many ex-nazis , even gestapo , working and living normal everyday life . â€™
â€˜ working for the stasi . â€™
the ddi reminded them all of the secret police who had run east germany with an iron fist .
â€˜ some , yes .
others returned to the job they had before the war .
within the new germany , many of them have become frightened .
their secret are no longer safe .
most of all , they fear the israeli . â€™
â€˜ is frick one of these guy ? â€™ asked the dda , remembering the name picked up by adam in new orleans .
â€˜ no , â€™ lied sorge .
his order were quite specific .
do n't ratify any name .
they did n't want the yank stumbling in and screwing up in an attempt to force the issue .
â€˜ so what 's all this got to do with the death of our agent ? â€™ continued the dda .
â€˜ we 're not sure .
except that a lot of the information we have both lost wa about the lucy ghost .
link that with trimmler 's death , goodenache 's sudden departure for germany and the mention of the lucy ghost during their conversation , and i think you will agree that is the strongest lead we have to follow . â€™
nobody spoke for a while , then the exec director reopened the discussion .
â€˜ ha moscow any suggestion a to how we should proceed ? â€™
â€˜ no , â€™ replied sorge , which wa what he 'd been told to say .
â€˜ we hoped you would come up with something . â€™
â€˜ i 'm sure we will . â€™
â€˜ can you tell u the name of some of these lucy ghost ? â€™ cut in the ddi .
â€˜ the one in russia .
how high up the ladder did they go ? â€™
sorge enjoyed his reply .
â€˜ in time , yes .
but i can tell you you 're wasting your effort looking for martin bormann in south america .
he died twenty year ago . â€™
he watched their stunned face across the room .
well and truly shafted .
they said little after that and sorge wa soon being escorted , with nowak , down to the underground garage .
five minute later they were on their way back to washington .
â€˜ bormann .
fucking bormann .
they had him all the time , â€™ said an astonished ddi .
â€˜ would'ya believe it ?
they probably got hitler stashed away too . â€™
â€˜ well , it 's been a real eye-opener , â€™ said the exec director .
â€˜ but let's not forget we 've still got a crisis on .
find the englishman .
that 's our first priority .
find him and see what the son of a bitch is upm_to . â€™
the amtrak crescent atlanta georgia
the train pulled out of atlanta station at 7.39 p.m. , four minute behind schedule .
they had slept well , eaten well , slept again and eventually got bored with the passing countryside .
adam had insisted they stay in the room and she had n't found a good enough reason to change his mind .
he wa thumbing through usa today for the umpteenth time , looking for something he might have missed , when he heard her giggling .
she wa in the swivel chair , reflected in the window with the dark night a a backdrop , her head angled towards him .
â€˜ what 's so funny ? â€™ he asked pleasantly , putting the paper down .
â€˜ you sure know how to give a girl a good time . â€™
â€˜ do n't i ? â€™ he grinned back .
â€˜ according to all the book , a secret agent 's life 's meant to be glamorous .
we 've spent twenty-four hour together and in that time i 've been bitten by bug in a hooker 's bed , tied up a guy with no leg and stolen his wheelchair , stayed cooped up in a train for twelve hour with an attractive man and behaved like a virgin .
do n't take that the wrong way .
but james bond would 've handled it differently . â€™
â€˜ he wa scottish .
i 'm english .
they prefer the ram 'em and bang 'em method .
we 're more sophisticated in our approach . â€™
â€˜ what happens next ? â€™
â€˜ in which department ? â€™
â€˜ in the where're-we-going department . â€™
â€˜ to nordhausen .
that 's where trimmler said he would meet goodenache . â€™
â€˜ trimmler 's dead . â€™
â€˜ and goodenache 's running from the russian .
he ca n't go back there .
from what i heard , germany wa still their home .
and nordhausen wa where they shared something special .
they wanted to go there .
if goodenache 's frightened , and he want to hide , that 's a good a place a any . â€™
â€˜ nordhausen .
where is that ? â€™
â€˜ central germany .
south of berlin , near what wa the old east-west border .
an industrial town .
it wa also where the nazi built most of their rocket , the v1s and v2s , during the second world war .
from what i remember , they moved most of the rocket manufacture down there so that our bomber could n't get to them .
built the factory right in the heart of the mountain .
used slave labour .
i think a lot of people died in the making of those weapon , before they ever got launched and blew up half of london . â€™
â€˜ why would they want to go back there ? â€™
â€˜ who know .
maybe it wa a job they never finished . â€™
â€˜ but they did .
those guy put people into space , put our people on the moon .
that 's enough for most people . â€™
â€˜ that wa just their work .
and they did n't do it for germany .
they did it for their conqueror . â€™
â€˜ you telling me that all those scientist spent their time in america and could n't wait to get home ? â€™
â€˜ not all of them .
most of them became good american .
and good russian , i suppose .
but these two wanted to go home .
they never stopped being german .
maybe it 's the only thing they ever dreamt about . â€™
â€˜ weird . â€™
â€˜ is it ?
to want to go home ? â€™
â€˜ all they 're after is their youth .
catching up with what they thought they 'd lost . â€™
â€˜ are n't we all ? â€™
she shrugged and looked thoughtful .
â€˜ penny for them , â€™ he said .
â€˜ i wa â€¦ uh â€¦ just being a woman . â€™
â€˜ tell me . â€™
â€˜ thinking of peter . â€™
â€˜ ah !
the venerable ex . â€™
â€˜ i know .
here 's u , heading for trouble and god know what else , and in the middle of you talking about nordhausen , i start thinking of peter .
wondering what the hell he 's upm_to .
the emotional mind of a woman . â€™
â€˜ stop knocking yourself . â€™
â€˜ make a change .
i usually leave that to you . â€™
he burst out laughing .
â€˜ ok , tough guy .
what 's got you so tickled ? â€™
â€˜ here we are , crammed in a small compartment in a train , hurtling across america being chased by the cia , the fbi and god know who else , and you 're worried about your ex-husband 's sex life .
christ , he must 've been good . â€™
â€˜ he wa a shit . â€™
â€˜ so , why â€¦ ? â€™
adam stopped and shook his head .
â€˜ because some of u like shit .
do n't ask me why . â€™
she laughed with him .
â€˜ he 's cheap , too .
he once bought me a louis vuitton handbag .
your travel case reminded me of it when we left the hotel .
it wa for our second anniversary .
i broke the lock and took it back to the shop in la jolla .
they told me it wa a fake .
a fucking hong kong fake .
can you believe that ? â€™
â€˜ what did he say ? â€™
â€˜ that he 'd bought it in new york when he wa there on a visit .
and if he could remember where the shop wa , he 'd go back and sue the bastard .
that 's peter for you .
a cheapskate liar and womanizer .
and i ca n't let him go .
that 's really pathetic news .
is n't it ? â€™
â€˜ no .
just human . â€™
â€˜ very understanding .
what would you know ? â€™
â€˜ maybe not woman , but â€¦ my parent .
and my twin brother . â€™
â€˜ you 're a twin ? â€™
â€˜ wa .
they all died when i wa nine . â€™
â€˜ you said they were out of the country .
that you had guardian . â€™
â€˜ we all have thing to hide . â€™
â€˜ wa he an identical twin ? â€™
â€˜ yes . â€™
â€˜ that mean you came from the same egg .
that right ? â€™
â€˜ something like that . â€™
he , in his usual stoical manner , did n't tell her that he had studiously learnt everything about twin and their relationship .
â€˜ i had a boyfriend in high school .
he wa a twin and his brother played on the football team .
if he got hurt , my guy used to suffer , too .
we used to watch the game together and i 'd suddenly see him wince in pain .
just like that .
and i 'd look on the field and it wa his brother who 'd been tackled . â€™
â€˜ yes .
something like that . â€™
he laughed .
â€˜ i remember once getting a tap round the head from my dad .
i 'd done something wrong .
i remember him saying it wa a shame that he had to punish u both when only one of u wa being naughty .
that tap sorted u both out . â€™
â€˜ do you still feel he 's with you ? â€™
â€˜ he is .
â€˜ then you 're lucky .
you 're not alone .
is that so bad ? â€™
â€˜ i do n't know why i 'm alive and he 's dead . â€™
â€˜ what 's his name ? â€™
â€˜ marcus . â€™
â€˜ nice name .
i 'm glad you 've got someone to love .
it 's important .
ours is actually a new house .
it wa but er the market wa so low that he decided not to well i do n't think he could get a buyer actually , it 's just stood there so he he he let it out rather than have it stood there with the option for u to buy it but i say now the price are lower he 's not keen on selling it at that price .
and i 'm not prepared to go on paying three thousand a year renting it to give to him when i could be buying one myself .
yeah .

mm .

if you wan na take it that way .
if if labour say get in
if labour get in and they ca n't fulfil their promise
yes .
like john smith 's made promise then that conservative have n't done this , that and the other , he must be able to do them now must n't he ?
who must ?
john smith .
well erm , they , they do n't know whether they can do it or not do they ?
no , but he 's criticizing the conservative policy and all that , and what we will do is this .
i know for investment
yes but they all say that
industry
do n't they until they get into power ?
i know .
and and then they all
they do .
back down .
they do .
yeah .
they 'll say they , they probably have n't got the finance to back up what they what they said they would do .
yeah but a a lot of quote gon na be made to them after are n't there ?
you know , like you said this and you have n't done it , you said that and you have n't done it and all that sort of .
yes but once they 're in power there 's nothing you
well
can do about it .
oh admittedly no .
no .
but they must feel a bit stupid to er
well i ca n't well i mean there 's an awful lot , i mean would , no , no matter which political party it is , they all make promise , but they do n't carry them all out .
no .
course not .
but i mean these are , these are major thing .
getting the economy right .
now john smith
but er well john may have
we 'll get the economy right .
now if he doe n't get the economy right he 's gon na end up with egg on his face and
of course he is .
but you tell me how just how is he going to do it ?
i mean , ee , they do n't explain to you how they 're going to do it do they ?
no .
they , they just come out er
with statement .
glibly with these , these statement .
mm .
mm .
i 'm sure that if there is an easy way of doing it the conservative would have found out and done it .
i do n't think there 's any any easy way .
i do n't see how they 're going to do it .
no .
i really do n't .
i mean where are they going , where are they going to get the extra money from er to pay for the old aged pensioner ' er eight pound rise ?
mm .
or so they say , we 'll get eight pound .
somebody 's got to pay for it .
so it 'll be the working people , er , probably the the national er , health stamp 'll have to go , go up .
it 'll be a sorry day if they get in .
it will gordon .
oh !
i do n't know .
you 're a real turncoat you are .
mm .
are n't you ?
mm .

they said , did you have any warning ?
and he said no .
none at all he said .
i wa gardening and he said er er i bent over to do something and he said i just went dizzy , he said , and i fell over he said and then i realized my right side wa paralysed .
and he said i wa completely confused and i could n't , he said i wa trying to shout my wife and erm and , er , you know my mouth would n't work , he said , but she said fortunately she looked through the window and er found him and they took him to hospital .
and they were saying , they were saying that , you know , you associate stroke with older people , but there 's a hundred young people a week have stroke !
tt .
aye .
and he said erm like it 's the clot to your brain that erm that cause it , you know .
they said , well did you have any warning about it ?
and he said er , no , he said i did n't think i had he said , but now , he said i realized that how i , wa forgetting er i 'd be talking and i 'd forget sort of what i wa just talking about that split second .
mm .
and now the stroke ha affected him that way .
he can be talking , say about a well , you know , about any er , about say a , a video recorder or something like that
mm .
and for a minute he can forget that he 's talking about it .
mm .
you know , but erm he he 's recovered reasonably well in the same , you know , but
got his use
very
back ?
er , partly back .
partly back .
not fully .
you know .

i know !
i mean you just do n't you do n't imagine that do you really ?
no .
it 's terrible !
but a hundred young people a week !

well , you know , i ca n't recall any of this .
yes .
did we , we go to edith 's to see her then did we not ?

because edith now edith wa going away for some unknown reason , i do n't know , she must have been going on another holiday anyhow .
no , she wa in park hospital a long time .
that wa it , because edith wa going on another holiday and she wa er , she wanted someone to go and visit er lilly , and i said well i 'll go .
and i , i , it wa when i had my own car and i drove there .
and i wanted to see her .
she wa very , very frustrated co she could n't speak .

i think you d' ya know i think you were at night school gordon when i think about it .
i think you were teaching at night school .

no !
i know why gordon .
because the the child were small .
one of u had to stay in .
oh yes .
aye , that 's right .

yes .
yes .
well i wa only at lillycups from august seventy till august seventy one .

and if you phoned me early in the year it must have been just after we got the v w.
yes .
i think it wa .
just a couple
so
of month after we got that
i think it wa because er co we 'd got iris ' er er triumph did n't we ?
that 's right .
yes .
soon after that .

i think we did gordon .
and you were driving that about .
that 's right .
that 's right .
well carl had n't passed
and you went , you went in that triumph did you to the
i did .
yes .
well it 's it wa later than seventy one you see .
mm .
and you had that car about two year did n't you ?

yeah .
when carl passed his er , to m g s.
yeah .
do you remember ?
yeah .
blimey !
do you mean , must be about twenty year ago then ?
yes .
yeah about twenty .
this is why you know , i , i think you should keep i keep diary from year ago because i know you do n't like nostalgia , and i do n't , but it 's interesting
mm mm .
to look up .
yes .
er , event .
yes .
i mean i 've got no diary dating back that long .
no , i know .
well i have n't .
i have no record of anything
no .
happening then .
no .
but just one line of thing that you know , i do n't mean a diary where you write a page every night , but just two line you know .
yeah .
all , and what you did and when i got the car , the date and when you got that triumph then .
yeah .
you know , little , just a line .
and then when you look at it er you can recall then
oh yes .
other thing .
that 's right .
the one line sort of set it all off , you can remember .
that 's right .
yeah .
mm .
yes but i remember , i can remember edith phoning me and , and saying , you know she wa going away , you know is , you know could i go down ?
and i said yes .
mm .
i , co i remember coming , coming back , i got lost .
you know where er that circle is where there 's the shop , well instead of taking i know , instead of taking one road i took another and i got completely lost !
mm .
mm .
i would n't now , but then i , i , i did n't know er round that area .
no that 's right really , i mean if you do n't know the area you do n't know which road to take on the island .
i know .
but i mean , you would n't have thought that er lilly , i mean , she had no weight on her or anything like
no .
that did she ?
no .
she 's always been active all her life .
all , been active all her life .
no , you ca n't understand how these thing happen .
well they give you all these bloody tip and paper about what to do , to avoid this and avoid that .
and what to eat and everything but
this bloody footballer , i mean it 's a
i know !
a really fit man .
i know .
he 's , er , one artery wa seventy percent blocked , it wa in the paper .
yeah .
and the other artery wa ninety percent blocked .
wa it really ?
yeah !
yeah !
good god !
i mean , he could have gone any time .
graham sounness , i mean he 's only thirty eight !
could have gone any time with with nothing through his bloody artery !
good god !
but that 's i did n't know it wa that bad .
it wa in the paper this morning .
and er
goodness me !
well he 's a , he , he did n't smoke .
no .
he wa an athlete .
he 's been an athlete .
he obviously ate like everybody else .
mm .
and he
i mean
wa n't overweight in any way .
wa n't overweight , what more
no .
the bloody hell do you have to do !
that 's incredible that !
see they say it wa a it 's hereditary .
well
co his father had a bypass did n't he ?
oh did he ?
i think some other relative died er
oh .
youngish .
yes .
oh well i bet , i think perhaps it is really .
i know .
it 's still going ?
i know .
yeah , and you ca n't , you ca n't understand it can you really ?
well look at the old lady that walk past here at ninety one !
that 's right , yeah .
yeah .
and she doe all her own shopping .
mm .
you know , i mean , she keep stopping but she 's , she 's remarkable !
she really is .
mm .
but they 're few and far between are n't they ?
when you 're like that .
yeah .
mm .
but what i could n't understand with this this fella that
this sounness ?
aye .
he , he found out co he went for , to , for a check up and they took his blood pressure .
yes .
and well lot of people go and have blood pressure taken , they find it 's high , and they
yes .
give them tablet .
yes .
go home .
why did they take it a stage further with him ?
he 'd got high blood pressure , he wa n't in any pain he 's living a normal life .
similar to what i wa when i went .
yes .
and they just give me tablet .
yes .
now why , what made them take it to the stage
well er well , first
where , he wanted a heart bypass ?
first and foremost he wa in a private scheme .
well , probably that 's it then .
yeah .
and probably because because of his father and er the the other relative having the bypass done .
so they took it
mm .
a step further , but i think probably , it 's because he wa in er er a private scheme .
very likely in n it ?
yes .
so there 's a lot of people walking about with just taking bloody tablet who probably really should have a bypass .
ah well i , well , i would n't say that really gordon .
i mean i think er , when your blood pressure wa found out and you 'd been taking tablet ever , so , i think it 's kept it all under control and you 've , you , we eat a sensible diet .
the only , the only er thing i complained about with you is , is the butter .
mm .
i do n't have that much now .
but i think everything in moderation , but you do n't eat a much butter now a what you used to .
i do n't eat that much bread you see .
no .
so i , i think really , and i think what i think with him , i think definitely i think it must be the private scheme and plus that his own family , it run in the family .
mm mm .
must be hell of a shock being told
oh god !
it must have been .
see how much it 's costing ?
two hundred and fifty pound a night !
yeah .
phworgh !
that 's without the operation .
yeah .
well he earned three hundred and fifty thousand a year then .
oh i know .
and plus he 's , he , he , he , he married an heiress you know .
did he ?
er him er , they live in spain now .
oh er he , he 's worth a pretty penny is sounness .
he went in carl 's shop the other , the other week .
did he ?
yes !
mm .
must have been looking for a house .
carl said he , he looked er well er , his face did , it were very he 's got a very poxy skin .
ha he ?
you mm .
yes .
he wa having it done this afternoon were n't he ?
yeah .
some time today .
aye .
i tell you what , that 's quick int it though gordon ?
with only going in last night and
mm .
having it done today .
it is indeed .
i wonder how quick they would have got him in though if he would n't have been in a private scheme .
he could wait six month could n't he ?
well he could have been dead by then .
well er , yeah , exactly that 's what they 're moaning about int it ?
terrible !
put them on a list and wait .
i 've never heard so much talk about health a we do nowadays .
oh i know .
when i wa young i i do n't remember talking all the time about bloody health and what you should do and what you should n't do .
no i know .
did you ?
no .
but we were n't educated in , in , in health though .
we just we just lived and that wa the end of it .
yes but then you see , in the in the old day gordon , i mean , you you were very fortunate if you got three meal a day and and whatever you got you were glad of and used to eat it all .
now we 're much more affluent and people are educated er
mm .
a regard their health .
mhm .
well having said that gordon , your mother lived to a good old age , and my mum , and my father did .
yeah .
and they ate all the wrong stuff did n't they ?
according to according to what they say now they did .
mm .
i know .
do n't know who to believe really .
when you look at , when you look at the some , all these , a lot of these composer and artist who died long ago and you look the birth range there 's a hell of a lot at seventy five , seventy six
yes .
oh there 's a few at forty odd .
mm .
but there 's a hell of a lot well into their seventy .
you know , and they were born early eighteen hundred .
yes .
yes .
yeah .
i know .
i know we 're living longer now generally but i wonder how much
i do n't know i
i wonder

how much , how much , i do n't really know .
co there 's more people now than there wa in those day .
yeah , there 's a lot more people .
it 's not anyhow , i mean , it 's alright living longer if you , if you , if you 've got all your faculty .
mm .
and you 've got good health and everything .
it 's no use living like a cabbage , i do n't think so anyhow .
no , that 's
and when i see these people in nursing home all sat round a wall in chair oh god !
i 'd hate to end up like that .
somebody 's .

i mean , on a wednesday .
and it 's only a quid to get in and it 's a pound , pound a pint .
two quid and , and a drink , yeah .
but on the other hand they 're making a little bit at a pound a pint .
well they 're making five or six hundred , they 're bound
to be getting on with it .
that 's right .
that 's getting in the
i do n't think they 've got a lot of staff on .
i would n't have thought they 'd bother with a
no .
student night , having a lot of staff on , it 's pointless having ah , i mean , the bouncer in that situation .
well you 'd only need one .
but we do n't need a bouncer on
except , mind you , the , the rough , the erm rugby club gave the band a bit of er , a rough seeing to .
what band ?
he had some band that were awful apparently and the
whole of the rugby team were lying in front of stage with their
they , they 've never left , they were playing the rugby club ?

mm .
doe the sugar house get that many people in ?
no .
no .
the sugar house only open er thursday , friday , saturday .
or , or , we always have done .
i mean , we we opened originally , first year , every night of the bloody week and it wa pointless , absolutely pointless .
is that bigger than the empire ?
i 've never been in it ?
yeah .
no !
er yeah .
yes it is .
is it ?
it 's legal , it 's legal
well it 's on , it 's on a thursday , yeah .
it 's it 's legally bigger than the empire but the empire can get more people in co he 's got upstairs and
yeah .
that
mm .
see .
but , of course , erm for licensing they do n't take that particularly into consideration up there .
well they half upstairs straight away .
yeah .
yeah .
so er
i mean , i think , i , i think the empire legally is well i thought it wa nine hundred
seven fifty i think .
i ca n't think er i do n't know .
i think it 's nine hundred .
i mean you could you could
well i thought it wa seven fifty .
certainly get seventeen , eighteen hundred in there .

mm .
few month were n't they ?
no , twelve , twelve or thirteen .
they never had fifteen .
did n't they ?
i mean the sugar house , his capacity 's
just been upped to eleven hundred i think .
erm i mean , it wa always nine hundred , but it 's been upped to eleven hundred last year i think .
well we used to put , i mean , i put twelve , thirteen hundred in the sugar house .
but but you it 's full at that , you know .
mm .
whereas the , the , the , you , you could you could , you could fit sixteen , seventeen hundred .
no , i reckon , there wa , they reckon between a , a thousand and eleven hundred for a night , you know .
but you could n't fucking move at that .
yeah , but it wa a , it wa also a it wa a bit of a celebrity , i mean it wa people , people were crushed around , bloody hell i mean
yeah , that 's right .

four add four and then
four add four equal eight .
two time four equal eight , right ?
yeah , like that .
and then two
and two time four is eight .
erm i did n't write it like that then .
right .
share the total of five
yeah , i done , yeah i done
er
five , five , five is fifteen .
five add five add five
erm is fifteen .
and then erm .
right .
is fifteen .
and then
and six
six six

add six add six
add six
add six
is thirty six .
right .
six time six is thirty
i 've done that one .
six .
that 's it .
okay ?
erm this .
i 'll leave that out .
leave that out .
add them up .
mm .
that much closer can use those picture .
take a look .
are they near the box ?
yeah .
is that right ?
four
four is twenty !
so it 's four so
four time five is
twenty !
four time five equal twenty .
er two time six equal twelve .
er four time three equal twelve .
er , two addition left .
alright .
those two add ?
so it 's like one , two , one , two and one there and but put like erm seven add seven add seven is .
is twenty one .
yeah .
seven add seven add seven is twenty one
one .
and three time seven
right .
is twenty one and do it that way , five and five .
okay ?
two addition question .
hang on .
two yeah but you 've got right two multiple and two addition equation .
not equation !
you told u this !
but , like these , these are equation .
so two addition equation er three time seven plus seven plus seven is twenty one .
right ?
oh !
so , but you can also go
yeah .
yeah add three .
three plus three plus three plus three plus three plus three is twenty one .
do it that way on .
do you follow
yeah .
me ?
yes i do .
right .
two multiplication
yeah .
and two addition .
two addition .
right .
so you , like , you .
yes , that 's right .
then , it 's like erm
one .
seven time three , and three time seven .
and three time seven .
that 's right .
and you do the same there .
same on the add .
and then , this we do like
right , she want currency in two division in each , right ?
so it 's one , two , three , four ,
that multiplication is a
yeah well division , okay , so it 's twenty one shared by say , if that 's one , two , three , four , five , six int it ?
oh i know what i 've got !
six time three is eighteen or three time six is eighteen .
i know what i 've done .
i 've put the , i thought it wa er okay .
six .
and division is shared by .
so you got to do eighteen shared by six is three and eighteen
have you got
shared by three is six .
so like , you go one , two , three , four , five , six six time you swap
three .
six time three
time three is eighteen
is three time six .
six .
yeah , and and you got
six time three and three time six .
and division is eighteen shared by three is six , and eighteen shared by six is three !
yeah ?
got it ?
i can not read .
three six are eighteen !
you got it ?
and you do the same there ?
hang on !
i have n't finished thirty three
one yet .
that 's what i do n't get .
why do multiplication equation for this similar line i do n't get how you do that ?
is it , would you like u to put
it 's four int it ?
it 's four
no two , four , six , eight , ten , twelve
yeah .
it
that 's two .
no , but it 's going to four look .
it 's going to four .
alright .
going into four .
what would i put ?
er one four is four , two four are eight , and three four is twelve .
a this is been shared by line int it ?
yeah and it 's on that one .
you do it like that do you ?
yeah , co it 's being shared by
oh !
so it 's , i would say that is er nine time four equal thirty six .
and on that one is er , sixty three shared by nine six time sixty three divided by nine
four .
no !
sixty three divided by nine is six !
write six through it .
ten six in n it ?
no , it 's ten six .
no , no wait a minute .
nine .
what should nine time ten emma ?
one nine is nine , two nine are eighteen , three nine are
twenty seven .
four nine are thirty six , five nine are forty five , six nine fifty four , seven nine are sixty three .
oh thank you .
right .
yeah , seven nine are sixty three .
hang on a minute !
six nine are
seven nine are sixty three .
hang on a minute !
seven
seven nine are sixty three !
sixty three .
yeah .
you work them out like that look .
yeah .
well seven nine , well ee er , it take you so long
look one , one nine is nine
yeah .
two nine are eighteen .
so that one there is six into thirty six .
i know !
but i still do n't get what you have to write !
well multiplication equation for this number line i would say is er i 've already told you that .
no , but i do n't know what i have to , i have to write !
eight time four equal thirty six .
do n't get it .
because it 's one , two , three , four , five , six , seven eight , no sorry , nine time four is thirty six .
nine time four equal thirty six .
like this look !
write it out on a piece of paper and you 'll and i 'll write them down .
no !
you do it yourself !
i 've told you what to do .
you do it like that .
i do n't get it though !

!
i know we 'll cope but what are you going to do ?

i know we 're not inviting anybody for lunch christmas day could n't cope with that but it would be quite to have them in the afternoon ca n't cope with the people !
oh yeah .
suppose we should do something , yeah .
well that 's what i wa thinking , perhaps we could go with somebody somewhere .
you know , like by a canal or something .
perhaps , well if it 's snowing it wo n't be quite the same .
that 's right .
conducive to tripping about !
but if it 's quite nice weather , it would be nice to invite somebody along i expect .
they could just .
stratford ?
yeah the stratford warrior running about every six week something like that .
is it six week since we saw the last one then ?
they did n't , they , they have them more frequently now and they 're getting even more and more infrequent now for the rest of the year .

what day ?
which day ?
monday .
are you ?
oh well
so that fit in quite well i could n't remember what i wa doing on monday but we said , sort of tentatively monday would be probably quite a good day i think .
better than thursday anyway .
so could tuesday night be inspector morse night ?
yeah co my mum will be here then .
oh right can we not take her home ?
unpaid !
well she 'll
we shall see !
have been here all day , wo n't she ?
so she might want to go home !
she want to tell u all about her wedding
could you tell her we 're going to watch inspector morse !
for the third or fourth time !
will she have watched inspector morse ?
she wo n't of watched it , co it 's bound to be on a wednesday night !
doe she like inspector morse ?
i do n't think she watch it normally .
no , she probably doe n't like it .
a bit spicy !
i bet she would , she love anything like that !
bit of a body !
mind you , it might be too complicated !
it wa i remember reading in the paper that it 's been it 's been filmed at a house which no one 's ever been allowed to go in even the great sort of one of these country mansion , it wa not
right .
and even people who write about
if it wa not , it ca n't be again , they 're always going in there !
well that 's fine .
it wa some country mansion in oxfordshire you know ?
mm .
it 's a you come off the
and how did
and
they get permission then ?
they somehow managed to persuade the owner , apparently it wa and it wa and nobody else had ever been allowed in this place not even erm historian who write about famous building , even they had been refused access !
where is it ?
somewhere in oxfordshire .
oh !
they do n't know where ?
oh .
so
this wa about last week 's episode ?
i think it wa about last week 's , but they seem to imply that it wa last week 's episode that would
oh .
do it .
we seem to have got one spare video if we do n't get it watched before wednesday .
alright .
well that 's the only chance .
oh yeah co we 're going to maryland tomorrow .
your dad .
mm .
erm not it wa n't about your dad , it wa about my birthday co
co
he 'd realized that it wa my birthday , and , what did i want ?
so i said send me a cheque and i 'll go and shop .
and ?
and last week co she 's quite generous is n't she ?
she is a bit but it 's .
no , i did n't say anything .
i think that 's the thing .
so your dad sent a cheque .
anyway i asked her if she 'd heard from your dad , and she ha heard from your dad apparently on friday he went to the consultant
mm .
and next week he 's got his first well she did n't know whether it wa radiotherapy or chemotherapy .
and she said he ha to go trotting to exeter two or three time a week now .
mm .
i do n't know how long it 's going to go on for , or what it is exactly but i thought it would be a good idea to ring your dad up and see .
mm .
but at least thing have moved , and at least they 've gone round .
so i 'm pleased really , are you ?
interesting that they 've done it so quickly is n't it ?
after seeing him , because he thought that once he 'd seen the consultant it would then take some time to get the treatment started , but they must have got themselves over that .
yeah .
well i mean everyone .
yeah .
i think .
got ta get moving .
and presumably whatever it wa the gp had give him ha had , upset that thrombosis again .
i do n't know whether to ring him tonight , oh it 's too late tonight now .
it 's much too late .
perhaps we could ring tomorrow afternoon when the child are up ?
well they love talking to them on the phone do n't they ?
i know they do .
we could can prime them up on what to say and type of thing to talk about so they do n't get moaned down or something !
bogged down !
so he 's had to go in , what did you say ?
three time a week ?
i do n't know she just said
something like that
a few time a week and i think it sounded like three co she wa wondering how he would cope with driving and everything .
mm a trial !
well i hope not i mean no he wo n't be able to drive
but presumably your mum can do that for , they 've got hundred of people there , he 's always driving people everywhere
that 's right .
so i do n't see why they ca n't drive him !
i 'm sure they will
yes .
co they 're very good are n't they ?
i mean look at that woman doing her er from the from the church .
at time like this it would be nice if we lived nearer could help out .
it would nice if we lived there but we ca n't so
it 's about .
and write a well .
yes .
double dose .
yes .
and pulled out .
well it 's sort of pulled out , but at least it 's .
we 'll be paying for it a well .
and it 's hard a well .
we 've been paying anyway , so it must of you know .
what doe erm you see er eileen 's and she 's having chemotherapy is n't she ?
by , by medication , is
that right ?
well she take all these tablet thing .
that 's right she ha a sort of massive dose every now and then .
and that make her feel what ?
she 's not in pain is she ?
more sort of dopey .
i would n't care if they made me dazed
yeah .
!
yeah .
i du n no .
not gon na
difficult to know .
oh yes , that wa it !
i wonder how bad it is , that feeling 's like , we do n't really know how bad it is do we ?
no .
perhaps he will be able to say , you know ?
but whether he 'd tell u over the telephone , you think ask .
i think he would would n't he ?
i think so .
co we 've got the agm in two week time
mm .
and we voted all these people that are here
what type of this ?
well you just
it doe n't matter .
