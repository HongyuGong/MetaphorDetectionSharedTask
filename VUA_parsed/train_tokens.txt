latest corporate unbundler reveals laid-back approach : roland franklin , who is leading a 697m pound break-up bid for drg , talks to frank kane
by frank kane
it seems that roland franklin , the latest unbundler to appear in the uk , has made a fatal error in the preparation of his â£697m break-up bid for stationery and packaging group drg .
he has not properly investigated the target 's dining facilities .
the 63-year-old head of pembridge investments , through which the bid is being mounted says , â€˜ rule number one in this business is : the more luxurious the luncheon rooms at headquarters , the more inefficient the business â€™ .
if he had taken his own rule seriously , he would have found out that drg has a very modest self-service canteen at its bristol head office .
there are other things he has , on his own admission , not fully investigated , like the value of the drg properties , or which part of the drg business he would keep after the break up .
when the bid was launched last week , mr franklin faced some criticism from city commentators on both those counts .
he regards the charges as unfounded .
on property , he is blunt .
â€˜ i do not regard property profits as earnings .
we have made a bid of nearly â£700m for a company with a book value of â£200m â€” we 've acknowledged there is some extra worth there , but i can not see the sort of value they are talking about in property .
if they can prove it is there , we might pay for it , â€™
on the other criticism he is equally dismissive .
â€˜ that point about the core business is very unfair , â€™ he says .
it is difficult to decide when you are an outsider what the business is like .
we would eventually like to do it along with the management , within the philosophy we will impose . â€™
the franklin philosophy was learnt in the us leveraged buyout business at the side of sir james goldsmith .
mr franklin went there at the end of the 1970s , after the collapse of keyser ullman , the merchant bank where he was a director that was rescued by the bank of england .
he feels that keyser 's problems were hastened by an unwise acquisition .
he went to the us because â€˜ goldsmith decided that if you wanted to be a capitalist the uk and france were not the places to be â€™ .
along with sir james he found the us much more attractive , taking over and breaking up some fairly hefty us corporations .
he rejects charges that he was partly responsible for the â€˜ casino atmosphere â€™ that gripped us corporate life in the early 1980s .
â€˜ we stirred it up , yes , but we never lost any money for anybody and we never added to the unemployment figures . â€™
what he has learned from goldsmith ( â€˜ the only genius i have ever come across â€™ ) is that the holding company is not the most important unit of corporate organisation .
â€˜ the concept of the company does not interest me - it 's the businesses that are important .
it does not matter whether or not drg makes sellotape or basildon bond â€” it 's of no consequence to anybody if somebody else makes them . â€™
and there is always the ultimate unbundler 's defence â€” that he will make money for his backers .
in a takeover campaign that has already seen vitriolic language , he responds to the charge that he is mounting the bid to enrich himself and his friends by saying : â€˜ nobody could take that as a criticism â€” this is an investor group .
it would be a criticism if i was doing it to impoverish myself â€™ .
letter : policy and politics at the labour party conference
from mr david soskin
sir : i was interested by your juxtaposition of â€˜ poll predicts 42-seat majority for labour â€™ with â€˜ tories hold on â€™ ( 30 september ) , the latter referring , of course , to the conservative victory in wandsworth , the significance of which appears to have been almost totally ignored by the media .
electors are always prepared to criticise the government in answer to pollsters ' questions , but when the same individuals arrive at the polling booth they simply can not bring themselves to vote labour into power .
letter : policy and politics at the labour party conference
from ms molly meacher
sir : despite a significant gap in the labour party 's education and training proposals , their objective to double the number of 16-18year-olds in full-time education must be welcomed ( 28 september ) .
england 's full-time staying-on rate stands at 28 per cent according to the latest statistics available .
this compares with 79 per cent in the us , 86 per cent in sweden , 45 per cent in west germany and 69 per cent in japan .
to add the part-time education and training statistics to those figures does not improve our relative position .
labour hopes to transform the situation by increasing the number of a-levels to five for the brighter youngsters and providing grants for four-year training courses ( two years in a further education college followed by two with an employer ) for the rest .
these reforms will only achieve their objective if accompanied by the implementation of the 1944 education act provision for compulsory part- or full-time education or training up to the age of 18 .
this clause has never yet been activated .
the sharply reduced number of 16-18-year-olds will inevitably lead employers to bid up the wages of that age group to entice young people away from education and into unskilled or semi-skilled jobs .
employers must be required to release 16-18-year-olds for education and training for at least two days per week .
only then will two vitally important and complementary goals be achieved : to improve britain 's general educational and vocational competence , and hence our productive capacity ; and to reduce our gross educational inequalities between the elite who receive a narrow education to a very high standard , and the rest .
letter : policy and politics at the labour party conference
from mr john pertwee
sir : labour does not need a commitment to proportional representation in order to scoop most of the centre ground at the next general election .
all it needs is to promise a high-powered investigation , such as a royal commission , into the practicalities of an alternative voting system ( surely justified by the intense public interest now abounding ) .
such a promise would be the only hope of a breakthrough for the disenfranchised voters and would have them flocking to the polls for mr kinnock .
his problem will be that mrs thatcher might decide to do it first , and then she will garner the votes .
letter : policy and politics at the labour party conference
from mr denis macshane
sir : if labour is to suggest the setting up of a specialist labour court ( 30 september ) , then such a momentous change in the industrial relations system deserves more discussion , and needs to be taken out of the hot-house of labour party conference politics .
for three reasons such a move should be welcomed .
first , it would bring britain into line with the best european practice , notably in germany where local , regional and federal labour courts handle problems in a fair , dispassionate way based on law , precedent and judicial expertise in the labour field .
second , it would ensure that workers enjoyed positive rights under law and reduce the emphasis of union immunities .
labour law will always reflect the balance of power in society , and a fully fledged labour court system will not remove class and fundamental employer-employee differences .
but it should be possible to create and enforce enough common rules to prevent the absurd see-sawing of industrial relations legislation we have seen since 1969 .
third , a labour division of the high court would contribute to the process of constitutional reform in britain which surely is to be a key political issue in the 1990s .
the â€˜ trade union question â€™ would cease to haunt the labour party and while that might upset some conservatives it would be good for the country .
letter : independence of no-fixed-abode
from the rev nerissa jones
sir : on saturday you published an advertisement for the 10 extra pages of news and features that you , the independent , will carry from 2 october .
â€˜ what do independent experts say about our 10 extra pages ? â€™ asks the advertisement .
the supposedly jokey answers are illustrated by photographs of people sleeping outside covered by copies of the independent : they look like some of the hundreds of visitors who come to st botolph 'm_s crypt centre for homeless people every day .
given the already appalling and growing rate of homelessness and lack of hostel facilities in london , when more people than ever will not only have to endure the freezing nights of the coming winter on the streets , but perhaps permanent homelessness , it was terrible to see the situation being exploited for a joke by your advertisement : â€˜ just the thing now the evenings are drawing in .
. â€˜ ; â€˜ the added coverage is exactly what i wanted â€™ .
how much â€˜ independence â€™ do you suppose a person has who exists on the no-fixed-abode giro of â£34.90 a week ?
letter : ec immigration checks on trains
from the rev j. gilmore
sir : the contents of sarah helm 's article â€˜ immigration checks to be made on trains â€™ ( 25 september ) are extremely worrying .
during the recent european community elections the representatives of ec governments promoted the ideal of a border-free europe by 1992 .
now , it would appear from this article , that this ideal is shattered and a two-tiered europe is on the cards .
one for those who travel by aircraft and one for those who travel by train between london and paris .
the presence of immigration officials and police on board trains is comparable to the scenes of 1930s america where migrant labourers were turned back at state boundaries .
what criteria would police and immigration officials use in their search for â€˜ potential terrorists â€™ on a train that they could not use at a static checkpoint or airport ?
do terrorists or illegal persons travel exclusively by train ?
this is a clear example of the extension of the prevention of terrorism act where criteria for stopping , questioning and searching are purely subjective to the official involved .
will a person 's accent , dress or skin colour indicate the potential terrorist or , for that matter , football hooligan or drug pusher ?
this is a recipe for fear and anxiety .
it may mean the detention of innocent people and indeed their imprisonment .
letter : cardinal sins
from mr jimmy donoghue
sir : the north-east publishers of viz are nearer the truth than they realise with their soccer strip ( 29 september ) .
cardinal hume has not only the cross of being a fervent newcastle united supporter to bear ; he is also known to irreverent members of mayfair 's jesuit farm street church by his initials , george basil hume .
latecomers who continue to hope
from anne applebaum in warsaw
dozens more east german refugees arrived outside the west german embassy yesterday seeking asylum and passage to the west , including some who missed by only a few minutes a train that took more than 800 of their compatriots to west germany .
many of the new arrivals , who waited in the street outside the embassy , said they were convinced there would be another train for them .
the one they missed pulled out from warsaw 's east station at 2.50am yesterday carrying 809 cheering east germans bound for the rhine region of west germany .
once upon a time another german government let lenin cross another germany in a sealed train on his way to russia .
more than 80 years later , lenin 's heirs are allowing refugees from their communist regime escape in the opposite direction , in an east german-made train travelling across east german territory .
among those leaving was cornelia , 22 , a young east berliner destined , she said , for west berlin via a very circuitous route .
â€˜ i still do n't know if my family know where i am or if they will suffer from my decision .
but i saw no other way out : i did n't know if i would ever have a chance again . â€™
some of the refugees had been living in polish exile for as long as seven weeks , while others arrived only a few hours before west german diplomats announced they could leave .
only two failed to go : a new mother and her child , who was born in a polish hospital four days ago .
the east german government 's decision to let the refugees leave across their own country came as a surprise to many , including some west german diplomats .
some of the refugees originally refused to touch east german territory again , but were reassured when two of the west german diplomats said they would accompany the train , to ensure that the rules were followed .
during the journey , east german officials will enter the train , and collect all east german passports .
west germans will then issue new ones .
legally , the refugees have been expelled from east germany , meaning that under current rules they can not return .
according to unofficial reports , the arrangement was designed by the west german foreign minister , hans dietrich genscher , the new polish foreign minister , krzystof skubiszewski , and the soviet foreign minister , eduard shevardnadze , who met recently at the united nations in new york .
communists allow burial of montenegro 's last king
from marcus tanner in cetinje , yugoslavia
the people of montenegro yesterday welcomed home the remains of nicholas i , their first and last king , after 70 years ' exile in italy , in belated fulfilment of his last will and testament .
thousands of montenegrins , many in national costume , waited at the quayside in bar for the italian warship that would bring him home .
then they formed a slow procession behind the coffin into the mountains to the old royal capital of cetinje for his reburial in the monastery there .
what was surely the last ever montenegrin â€˜ royal event â€™ was masterminded by the republic 's new communist leadership , which has abruptly stopped describing nicholas as a class enemy , to ride the same wave of popular patriotism and royal fervour which swept serbia in the recent celebrations of the 600th anniversary of the battle of kosovo .
the latest biography now calls him â€˜ an outstanding statesman , warrior and man of letters â€™ .
â€˜ if i die abroad in exile , let my body rest in a temporary grave until my mortal remains be transferred to our dear homeland , â€™ said the montenegrin president , branko kostic , reading the royal will and testament to the crowds in cetinje square , who carried flags and portraits of nicholas and his queen , milena .
â€˜ today the people of montenegro fulfill the wish of their first and last king guided by innate love and respect for their history , â€™ he went on .
â€˜ our tourist organisations are counting on big profits , â€™ said srdan darmanovic , a member of the montenegrin central committee .
â€˜ this will be good for the montenegrin economy too . â€™
montenegro 's young and go-ahead leadership , which came to power this year amid furious popular dissatisfaction with the â€˜ old men in grey suits â€™ , sponsored the gathering of nicholas 's surviving relatives â€” the first â€˜ royal reunion â€™ organised by a communist government .
â€˜ a letter dropped through the post from the president of the socialist republic of montenegro , inviting me to the funeral , â€™ said john kennedy , a conservative party member who lives in barking and is a distant relative of nicholas .
montenegro 's sudden rehabilitation of nicholas 's memory is a popular move .
â€˜ he liberated us from the turks and fought for our independence , â€™ said a small boy who waited at the quayside amid a jostling crowd of former monarchs , visiting serbian bishops and television crews .
marko radoman , 103 , and a veteran of both balkan wars , was given a place at the front as one of the few with personal memories of nicholas 's reign .
for a man whom rebecca west , a contemporary balkan observer , called â€˜ repulsive â€™ and â€˜ treacherous â€™ for deserting his serbian son-in-law , king alexander , in the first world war , it is a sepia-tinted view of history .
nicholas was known as â€˜ the uncle of europe â€™ for his success in marrying his beautiful but penniless daughters into the grander royal houses of russia , serbia and italy .
this furthered his long-term ambition to rule a large â€˜ south slav â€™ kingdom when the ottoman empire finally collapsed .
one daughter , a grand duchess of russia , even gained a footnote in history by introducing an unknown monk , rasputin , to the russian tsarina alexandra .
in his minute , inaccessible capital , which today has only 15,000 inhabitants , nicholas erected a miniature european court and an exquisitely furnished victorian palace .
he even persuaded 12 european powers to turn cottages into full embassies .
it was a fair achievement in a town which an earlier observer described as â€˜ 44 hovels â€™ .
but nicholas 's grand design collapsed in 1918 when his serbian son-in-law , alexander , deposed him and incorporated montenegro into yugoslavia .
obituary : virgil thomson
by peter dickinson
virgil thomson was a composer and writer of originality , courage and wit formed by a unique mixture of american and french influences .
thomson was born in kansas city in 1896 , studied at harvard , and then mostly lived in paris until 1940 .
his missouri childhood gave him access to baptist hymns and church music , but at harvard he was introduced to the writings of gertrude stein and the music of erik satie .
these influences laid the foundations for the blend of the naive and the sophisticated which is the hallmark of thomson 's maturity .
like many young american composers he studied with nadia boulanger , but after 1925 set out to achieve the â€˜ discipline of spontaneity â€™ which he found in stein 's writings .
when he collaborated directly with her in opera the result was of historical significance .
first came four saints in three acts , produced in 1934 , and then the mother of us all ( 1947 ) , which demonstrated a new kind of plotless opera only now reaching a wider currency through the stage works of philip glass .
in four saints thomson 's informality was given free reign since he first of all improvised the music at the piano then , when it stuck , wrote it down to a figured bass .
he said : â€˜ i had wondered whether a piece so drenched in anglican chant ( running from gilbert and sullivan to morning prayer and back ) could rise and sail . â€™
but the resulting mixture of hymns , folksy tunes and recitatives â€” at times of intoxicating banality â€” was a sensation .
the opera , like gershwin 's porgy and bess the following year , used an all-black cast and the staging and choreography gave it a british connection since it was by frederick ashton .
the mother of us all shows more continuity , but again much depends upon production in what is still a largely non-narrative opera .
in 1936 , three years before aaron copland , thomson started writing film scores which were a model of unobtrusive clarity and pertinence , combining american materials to suit documentaries such as the plow that broke the plains and the river with the musique d'ameublement approach of satie .
his score for the film louisiana story was awarded the pulitzer prize in 1948 .
another response to a visual stimulus was thomson 's series of musical portraits of people such as picasso and aaron copland .
the first of these was written in 1928 and they number about 150 .
just as thomson transferred stein 's literary abstraction to music , so these portraits unusually employ the painter 's technique of drawing the sitter from life : an ideal combination of thomson 's habit of immediate response with an actual subject .
the results are terse and sharply etched , like the best line drawings .
thomson could control words with the same fastidiousness as notes .
he always felt that effective musical criticism began by being well written , and he never lost his liveliness .
one never quite knew what he was going to say next .
he started by writing occasional articles but in 1939 he wrote the state of music , a trenchant and provocative assessment of the machinery of the musical profession at the time .
from 1940 to 1954 he wrote regularly for the new york herald tribune and four volumes of his notices have appeared in book form .
he wrote a fulsome 400-page autobiography , characteristically entitled virgil thomson on virgil thomson , and a personal survey , american music since 1910 , appeared in 1972 , followed recently by a selected edition of his letters .
as both composer and critic he touched both sides of the coin : a climate of receptivity is what the artist most desires .
it is also a thing that even the most experienced reviewer can not always offer .
thomson 's judgements about music were not always as accurate as his confident expression implied : he invited discussion .
above all he restored the focus of music criticism onto the music itself .
he made no secret of his francophile enthusiasms , in reaction to the earlier domination of american music by germans , and he was one of the first writers to register the importance of jazz .
he fearlessly attacked convention , which caused problems when he pitched into established reputations .
it has become increasingly apparent that thomson belonged to the american experimental tradition .
he anticipated some of the enthusiasms of john cage , whom he first met in 1941 .
a few years later thomson recognised cage as â€˜ the most original composer in america , if not the world â€¦ â€™ and cage repaid the compliment by writing the works section of a monograph on thomson .
but finally , in spite of their common roots in satie and stein , thomson felt that cage 's aesthetic was destructive .
thomson 's songs contain some of his finest work .
there are stein settings , such as â€˜ portrait of fb â€™ , but also cycles such as five songs from william blake , prayers and praises and a cantata based on poems by edward lear .
thomson was also prolific in instrumental music on both chamber and solo scale .
for many years thomson lived in new york in his apartment at the chelsea hotel .
from there , like a buzzard in its eyrie , he would make forays round the us and abroad in spite of his advanced age .
he seemed a genial and indestructible landmark in the history of american music , in spite of defective hearing which had bothered him since the late seventies .
he had a photograph of himself on his postcards and he signed his letters following the original tailpiece â€˜ everbest â€™ .
thomson came from a generation of american composers which had to find its own way without benefit of university patronage .
in that kind of free market he thrived and survived â€” and so will the best of his work .
obituary : thomas keller
by hugh matheson
thomi keller is the outstanding figure in the history of international rowing .
he was president of fisa ( federation internationale des societes d'aviron ) , the world governing body , for 30 years ; and most of this body 's attitudes and practices reflect the force of his strict , but genial personality .
most athletes first encountered him as a voice , bellowing in multi-lingual fury at officials who had broken rules or arrangements designed to make racing safer or more fair .
he was elected to succeed gaston mullegg as president of fisa when he was 33 and still competing in the swiss rowing team .
he did not loosen his links with the athletes when projected upwards into the presidency .
provided their behaviour was sportsmanlike and safe , oarsmen found only encouragement and humour from a president who was always among them .
keller 's zurich upbringing made him into a skiier and sculler , and he raced for the grasshopper club .
he competed for the swiss cross-country and ski-jumping team at the student winter games and later concentrated on single sculls .
in 1950 , he was swiss sculls champion and finished third in the european championships before moving to manila to work for his family 's private multinational company , eduard keller ltd , for four years .
on his return , keller was swiss champion again in 1955 and was bitterly disappointed when the swiss chose to boycott the 1956 olympics after the russian intervention in hungary .
fisa was then a relatively unimportant body which organised european and other championships and participated in the running of olympic regattas .
as a rich , forceful young man , keller had been earmarked as a likely future president , even before mullegg was killed in an aircrash in 1958 .
rowing was transformed in the breadth and depth of participation over the 30 years of his term .
he sat on the appropriate boards of the international olympic committee and was president of the general assembly of international sports federations for 17 years .
these positions were not held for his own status but to promote the cause of rowing where it needed clout .
he successfully defended rowing as an olympic sport and in 1976 introduced women 's events , which have now expanded to six classes .
his personal preference for sculling over rowing assisted the introduction of quadruple sculls to world championship and olympic competition .
keller was made a steward of henley royal regatta in 1976 , a time when the proliferation of new six-lane , still-water courses around the world , which had emerged under his guidance , seemed a threat to the regatta founded in 1829 .
but it was the spirit of henley , with huge crowds enjoying amateur sport , presented with administrative finesse , which keller took as the yardstick for the international circuit .
he loved the place and he returned every year to play an often small part as umpire of races between undistinguished clubs far below the olympic standard he was obliged to administer .
he said this summer that as he gradually wound down his involvement in sport , henley would be the last thing he would give up .
during his term as president of fisa he gradually reduced his role in eduard keller ltd and used the company offices to provide a world headquarters for rowing .
the sport is now obliged to find income from the more normal sources of television and sponsorship , to replace his largely unacknowledged private patronage .
in spite of his gift to the sport , keller was anxious not to abuse his status as president and never went to a rowing event unless invited .
because of this , he had never seen the oxford and cambridge boat race until this year .
he was enthralled by the entire proceeding and remarked that only the english could make a contest between two crews which would not rank in the world 's top 10 into a bigger spectacle than the olympic final .
the final task he set himself for his presidency , which was due to end next year , was to weed out of the regatta calendar all the rowing courses which could be made unfair by the wind .
he had recently travelled from tasmania to norway in search of the perfect 2,000 metres of flat water .
it was a blessing that , in response to congratulations on the superb world championship regatta at bled in yugoslavia three weeks ago , he was able to reply , â€˜ yes â€¦ and best of all , the conditions were fair throughout â€™ .
the labour party conference : cook appeals for labour to accept electoral reform
by colin hughes and colin brown
an impassioned appeal for labour to back electoral reform was made by a leading shadow cabinet member yesterday after the national executive decided overwhelmingly to oppose a proportional representation motion .
robin cook , a member of the national executive and the health spokesman , said that a labour government which sought to force its programme on an unwilling nation would be unsocialist .
he told a labour co-ordinating committee rally that it was not enough for labour to win the next election .
it would also be necessary â€˜ to smash the decrepit , effete constitution that allows a minority to capture power , and then use it ruthlessly in the interests of the privileged few â€™ .
mr cook argued that 10 years of thatcherism had been forced on most people , who had never voted conservative , and that many of those who opposed pr in the labour party wanted to use the same undemocratic power â€˜ to ram socialism down the throats of a majority who did n't vote for it â€™ .
advocates of the first-past-the-post system argued that it was the only way of delivering strong government , mr cook said .
but after 10 years of tory rule , he had had enough of that approach to politics .
labour would be acquiescing in a â€˜ democratic outrage â€™ if it continued arguing that , because the conservatives had got away with being undemocratic for so long , it was now labour 's turn .
mr cook also countered the argument that pr would build in a pull towards the centre ground , preventing labour from implementing a radical programme .
it seemed strange to make that argument , mr cook said , when it was clear the whole policy review process was designed to placate the centre ground .
â€˜ i can not honestly see that a system which would require us to compromise the morning after the election is really so morally inferior to a system which has already obliged us to compromise our policies two years before polling day . â€™
his speech , however , came aftera 24-4 vote in the national executive to oppose a proportional representation motion which will be debated on thursday .
the four were mr cook , ken livingstone , john evans and clare short .
mr livingstone said he was against pacts , but 10 years of thatcherism had demonstrated the dangers of giving power to elites .
however , neil kinnock , the labour leader , and roy hattersley , his deputy , both opposed the motion .
mr hattersley said giving disproportionate power to small , minority centre parties would not improve democracy .
mr kinnock said it was wrong to propose a fundamental change in the voting system for a short-term tactical vote to get rid of the thatcher government .
the only way to remove the government was for labour to win the next general election .
mr kinnock intends to reinforce his conviction that labour is in a position to win in his keynote speech tomorrow .
party organisers want the conference to show that the party is united as never before , leaving mr kinnock free for the first time to sell the policy package to voters without worrying about splits .
there is expected to be a close vote on defence , but mr kinnock is confident the new policy will be affirmed today .
the executive is recommending rejection of a motion calling for unilateral disarmament .
it is also urging the conference to oppose a motion , supported by the national union of mineworkers , to commit a labour government to abolishing all nuclear power within 15 years .
there could also be controversy over the executive 's rejection of demands for the age of consent for homosexuals to be reduced to 16 years .
pub rock / pint-sized rock â€˜ n â€™ rollers : jim white selects the best of the london pub venues and gigs in the weeks ahead
by jim white
general tips a general rule for pub rock patrons is that the quality of music will be in inverse proportion to the quality of the beer ( except at finsbury park 's sir george robey where an excellent music policy comes complete with a decent pint of guinness ) .
another rule of thumb is that if the act is obliged to rest their microphone stand and amplifiers on beer crates instead of the stage , it will be a good evening .
there are two types of pub rock occasions : those , like the one described above , where the band is likely to suffer from agrophobia ; and those where the pub is so crowded , death through asphixiation seems to be the only way to get out .
there is no half-way house .
if it 's a comfortable evening 's entertainment you 're after , stay at home with the video .
dress varies , but will never be up .
who to watch while the best that chart music can manage in the way of band names is black box , the pub circuit has always been ripe with imaginative handles .
cheerfully bending ears this week somewhere in london are bald howlin' bastard , daisy chainsaw , the wandering crutchless , benny profane , the gordon jackson five and new fast automatic daffodils .
we have no idea whether the music matches the nomenclature , but it must be worth â£5 of anyone 's money to encourage them .
playing this week tonight bop brothers blues band the plethora of litigation surrounding blues brothers lookalikes almost matches that attached to the release of wired , the unofficial biography of the original brother , john belushi .
suffice to say , whether boogie , bop or simply blues , this set of brothers , whatever they once were before they fell out and dispatched solicitors to sue their siblings , will be wearing dark glasses , pork pie hats , black side-burns and will be playing stax/atlantic type material .

ripping yarns and moral minefields : allan and janet talk ahlberg talk to celia dodd about their bestsellers for children
by celia dodd
these days , no one questions the importance of good books for the under-fives .
but books that appeal to adults too are just as important ; we are , after all , the ones who have to do the reading .
there are few things worse than being bludgeoned into reading a book you hate .
story-reading should be one of the great joys of parenthood , a real meeting of adult and child minds .
with the ahlbergs ' books , it very often is .
the husband-and-wife partnership behind such classics as the jolly postman , burglar bill and the baby 's catalogue win children over with ripping yarns and a wicked sense of humour .
they win their parents over with a rose-tinted vision of the world which is decidedly reassuring .
their books are usually set nostalgically in the past â€” the thirties and forties are favourite periods â€” and often feature the perennial characters of fairy tales and nursery rhymes .
yet they are saved from sentimentality by the wry humour of both text and pictures .
the ahlbergs have been accused of not facing up to the harsh realities of life , of being too cosy and sweet , but their latest picture book , bye bye baby , published today , breaks the mould .
in it , a small child roams the streets , talking to strangers , until he finally goes off with a woman who has been wandering about pushing an empty pram .
curious subject matter for a children 's picture book , you might think , and hardly guaranteed to win the approval of the gimlet-eyed children 's book world .
but the ahlbergs have no time for literal interpretations of their work .
how , they argue , would alice , or the wind in the willows , stand up against such scrutiny ?
the way to look at bye bye baby , they insist , is as a â€˜ light , surreal comedy â€™ .
â€˜ certainly if you bring a literal interpretation to the story , it 's a minefield , â€™ allan ahlberg says .
bye bye baby gets away with its particular minefield thanks to the sleight of illustrator janet ahlberg 's hand .
the visual inspiration for the book was the famous advert for start-rite shoes , showing a small boy and girl walking off down a tree-lined avenue â€” an innocent image if ever there was one .
the ahlberg version features a solitary figure .
the advert gave the story its vaguely thirties setting .
the success of the ahlbergs ' working relationship must have a lot to do with their long and happy marriage .
in spite of apparently incompatible personalities â€” she is small and shy , he is large and does most of the talking â€” they have an empathy which is essential to the way they work , a persistent mutual pestering .
the strength of the partnership is highlighted for allan , who also works with a number of other artists .
the time-consuming nature of janet 's part in the process , combined with a bad back which prevents her spending more than a couple of hours at the drawing board every day , means she can not keep up with her husband 's prolific output .
â€˜ with other illustrators , i work at a distance â€” we visit and phone , but there is a point at which i ca n't pester them any more , â€™ allan says .
they see themselves not as author and illustrator , with separate roles , but as a partnership of â€˜ book-makers â€™ , contributing equally to the process .
allan ahlberg says : â€˜ in the past , a lot of children 's books seemed to be the work of talented illustrators whose pictures looked brilliant framed in a gallery , but when you tried to read the book , there was nothing there , because the words started as a coat-hanger to hang pictures on . â€™
given the importance they place on the interrelationship of words and pictures , the couple 's working lives are surprisingly separate .
they claim to see each other less than couples who go out to work , meeting for the occasional cup of coffee in the kitchen .
their 10-year-old daughter , jessica , who is likely to be seen with her head buried in the beano or a roald dahl novel , has provided the inspiration for many of her parents ' books .
as a baby , she was fascinated by the mothercare catalogue , and so the baby 's catalogue , which documents the paraphernalia of the infant 's small world in minute detail , was born .
allan 's experience as a primary school teacher is another rich source of ideas .
the couple still maintain close links with local schools , where they spend hours researching , sketching and absorbing jokes .
after 10 years of teaching allan had had enough .
â€˜ i ran out of steam .
it 's a killing job .
little kids eat you alive , they want so much physically and emotionally . â€™
every year he would have half a dozen nine- and 10-year-olds in his class who could barely read .
he treated reading as a team effort , getting them to read the daily mirror rather than the dull , babyish books on offer .
these days , he writes the books intended to help children learn to read .
â€˜ a lot of books used in schools are technically readable but rather drab stories .
there 's no reason why they should n't be funny or gripping even if they do n't use many words . â€™
writing books for children is becoming increasingly complex , as the arbiters of the modern child 's mores â€” librarians , teachers and publishers â€” lay down ever more stringent criteria .
â€˜ the problem with children 's books increasingly is that there are armies of people who are properly concerned with , for example , the way girls were always discriminated against in the past , â€™ says allan .
â€˜ that is bad , and must be thought about .
but people seem to think that stories are written to a prescription , that you sit down and say , you do n't want it to be sexist , you do n't want it to be racist .
in reality you just invent a tale , as if you were sitting round a fire in a cave . â€™
in fact anti-racism and anti-sexism seem to come naturally to the ahlbergs .
their books are full of female breadwinners and new men changing nappies and comforting bawling babies in the small hours .
although they are a principled pair â€” they once turned down the smarties award on moral grounds â€” the ahlbergs reject the notion of children 's author as moralist .
â€˜ i would say , just sit down and tell a good story , and to hell with the morality , â€™ allan ahlberg declares .
with that characteristically strong statement , he puts his finger on the secret of the ahlbergs ' phenomenal success with adults and children alike .
the revolution the countryside needs : christian wolmar says britain is lagging behind in setting up â€˜ telecottages â€™
by christian wolmar
the information technology revolution has left large swaths of rural britain untouched .
the only computers in many villages are those owned by the teenage boys of the affluent to play their wham-bam games .
ashley dobbs , an engaging young entrepreneur , is setting out to change that by creating a nationwide network of â€˜ telecottages â€™ .
this clever name , with its neat evocation of new and old , describes a concept which was developed in sweden and is spreading to rural areas across the world .
in mr dobbs 's words , a telecottage is â€˜ a room in a village filled with computer communications that can be used by local people to learn and work â€™ .
the equipment consists of , perhaps , four word processors , a modem , a laser printer able to produce artwork-quality output , a fax and a photocopier .
software programmes for desk-top publishing , word processing , accounting and business planning are also essential .
mr dobbs , who is chairman of telecottages uk , warns possible users not to get bogged down with the technology : â€˜ the equipment is a tool to overcome what needs to be done .
people must n't think that because there 's a computer , they 've got to think of a use for it . â€™
he reckons there are no shortages of possible uses â€” farmers can use it to do their accounts , women with child-care responsibilities can work in their own time on the word processors , publicity material for local craftsmen can be produced and so on .
this may sound utopian , but it has been borne out by the experience of existing telecottages .
so far about 100 have been established , mainly in scandinavia but also in japan and several third world countries .
as the network expands , so do the uses .
the first was opened in the village of vemdalen in the remote forests of sweden in september 1985 .
the impact , according to henning albrechsten , president of telecottages international who has been involved in their development since the outset , was immediate .
â€˜ by holding open meetings for children and having the telecottage above the local store , people of all walks of life came in - small-scale entrepreneurs and their spouses , shop assistants , craftspeople and children .
now , 15 per cent of the village regularly uses telecottage and at least 20 per cent has taken courses there . â€™
britain is lagging behind .
no telecottages have been established , but there are several initiatives in the offing .
the most advanced is a plan for five in the north of scotland which will be funded by the highlands and islands development board and british telecom .
colin pavey of british telecom hopes that they will be running by the end of the year .
â€˜ two would be business-orientated and three would be community-orientated and located in schools .
we are most interested in the idea of networking , sharing skills such as translation and using them for distance learning . â€™
telephone cables in the region are being upgraded to ensure they are capable of handling faxes .
mr dobbs 's more unlikely allies are the women 's institutes .
most of the workers in telecottages and many of the users are women .
he says : â€˜ in villages there are many women with skills who are n't using them because of child-care problems .
but they are interested in working .
users of telecottages are given the key and people can use them at any time , which means that women can come in during the evening , early in the morning or whatever . â€™
he is working on a scheme with the national federation of wi to organise a competition to celebrate next year 's 75th anniversary by offering 10 telecottages as prizes for its 9,000 branches and he is hoping the wi will establish a pilot telecottage near its college in denman , oxfordshire .
while telecottages should become self-financing once established , they do need initial subsidy .
the cost of providing the start-up equipment is in the order of â£10,000 and mr dobbs thinks space is not much of a problem : â€˜ there 's usually the village hall or an empty shop . â€™
henning albrechsten reckons that it takes three years for a telecottage to be able to function without subsidy .
in scandinavia , with their mixed economies , money is always available , after a bit of persuasion , from both local and central government .
in britain , the tight financial regime imposed on local councils and the reluctance of central government to take on any new expenditure makes it necessary to seek funds from the private sector .
the only government support so far has been a recommendation by the rural development commission , part of the department of the environment , to establish a pilot scheme .
mr dobbs sighs : â€˜ this is a typically british bureaucratic response .
it 's been proved elsewhere that they work .
we do n't need pilots , we need telecottages . â€™
as for the private sector , while bt may be happy to provide pump priming for five telecottages in the north of scotland , it is not about to bankroll a nationwide network .
nor , it seems , is anyone else .
there is more at stake here than just bringing boxes of sophisticated equipment to remote areas .
as mr dobbs , who runs a country house restoration business from his home in micheldever , hampshire , says : â€˜ villages are good places to live and work .
the village is a fantastic institution and they make people happier . â€™
but the villages are dying , becoming suburbs or dormitories where few people work but many sleep .
employment in agriculture , still the main rural industry , fell from over a million in the mid-sixties to under 100,000 now .
the aim of telecottages is to create well-paid , flexible employment which will provide new jobs and make existing rural industries more competitive .
the emphasis on high wages is important .
villages are expensive to live in and if they are to become vibrant communities again , local people must be able to earn enough to be able to continue living in them .
there is a wider impact , too .
the abstract talk of commuting by rail or road being replaced by information technology finds a concrete expression in the idea of telecottages .
once people overcome their fears about computers and begin to use them in telecottages , they acquire their own equipment .
many may eventually be able to work from home rather than commute to an office .
henning albrechsten says : â€˜ modern information technology has given people in remote regions the opportunity to overcome their worst handicap ; their distance from the centres of learning and development . â€™
he sees them as not only strengthening small communities , but also as actually beginning to reverse the population flows from the countryside to the towns .
britain , with its growing traffic problems , seems an ideal place for the onset of this revolution .
despite mr dobbs 's tireless efforts , this is another revolution which britain is likely to be viewing from the sidelines .
rugby union : welsh horizon all turns black
by steve bale
each new indignity in the heap visited on welsh rugby seems worse than the last .
the selectors knew they were playing with fire when they decided to arrange a couple of club fixtures and they have duly been consumed in a conflagration of their own making .
the new zealanders , appropriately garbed in funereal black , arrive next week to scatter the ashes .
on and off the field the national game of the land of song is in a discordant mess .
losing was one thing but to lose as spinelessly as the welsh xv did to bridgend on saturday was to add insult to severely injured pride .
â€˜ in all honesty we should have won by at least 15 points , â€™ brian nicholas , the bridgend coach , said .
as if 24-17 and derisive chants of â€˜ easy , easy â€™ were not bad enough , this humiliation was against a side who have made a wretched start to the season â€” a week earlier pontypool had given them a 35-6 going-over â€” and were short of at least half-a-dozen first-choice players .
four of the absentees suffered the squirming discomfort of being among the welsh squad .
â€˜ it 's not that i do n't want to say anything but i just do n't know what to say , â€™ john ryan , the welsh coach , sighed .
his plans in ruins , he is now reduced , micawber-like , to hoping something will turn up before his players face the all blacks in five short weeks .
at bridgend he looked in despair , and he almost admitted as much : â€˜ i hope we can pull it together but sometimes i have my doubts . â€™
nicholas was sympathetic : â€˜ he is only as good as the players we give him . â€™
but another selector confided the truth that wales should be giving club opposition a hammering â€” and at half-time , building on their win over newbridge , it looked as if they would .
they had weathered bridgend 's early fury , conceding a try before coming back with some confidence to score three of their own .
but wales were having us on .
from the comparative opulence of 17-6 they then slipped into penury by conceding 18 unanswered points .
bridgend raised their game against wales ; now wales must do precisely the same against new zealand .
no one who was at the brewery field ( perhaps not even the selectors ) would give twopence for their ability to do so .
the backs were mainly pedestrian but the fundamental problem lay elsewhere .
apart from kevin moseley 's steady supply from the line-out , there was nothing much to commend in a welsh forward effort which reverted to the very worst eighties stereotype of static , cumbersome donkeys only too willing to slow the game to walking pace .
â€˜ when the pressure comes on , players revert to bad habits , â€™ ryan said .
the all blacks would treat such an outmoded approach with the scorn it deserves , although on the other hand they might have been impressed with bridgend 's contrasting mobility and aggression .
the back row were swifter to the loose ball , had a clearer idea of what to do with it when they got there , and their impressive half-backs were given every opportunity â€” which they eagerly took â€” to control the game .
this was conveniently encapsulated in the first try .
wales , characteristically , delayed the heel at a scrum , putting robert jones in trouble when the ball finally emerged .
he was scragged by mike budd , jeremy cooper came away with the ball , owain williams acted as the link , and kevin ellis scored : three back-row forwards and their scrum-half in perfect harmony .
wales 's instant reaction , a try by arthur emyr , and subsequent steady improvement , bringing well-crafted tries for emyr and robert jones , promised more than was later fulfilled .
in the third quarter bridgend had little difficulty in wiping out an 11-point deficit , huw bevan supporting aled williams 's break for their second try .
it was a magnificent fightback and such was welsh distress that they never looked like preventing it .
â€˜ we have taken a step backward , â€™ ryan said â€” and on this sorry evidence it looks as if it will be backwards all the way when the test takes place at cardiff arms park on 4 november .
as the welsh squad do not meet again until 30 october , time has all but run out .
football : hazard hints at the missing gifts
by patrick barclay
how to describe saturday 's match between chelsea and arsenal ?
well , i seem to recall a london gallery exhibiting a pile of rubbish , which was considered valid art by the proprietors and drew a large attendance .
the only redeeming feature of a goalless , worthless event at stamford bridge was that it did not require a grant .
yet the chelsea manager , bobby campbell , and arsenal assistant , theo foley , agreed it had been a good match , and the spectators ' complaints were muted .
some even applauded the players at the end .
it takes all sorts .
bobby robson was there to assess world cup candidates , but nothing positive emerged from 90 minutes of scuffling that made one almost yearn for the more measured boredom of rangers ' european cup exit in munich three days earlier .
at least the outcome was appropriate .
had either of the teams won , they would have taken the league leadership .
instead liverpool stayed top without kicking a ball .
television had postponed manchester united 's scheduled visit to anfield so it could be shown live on 22 december , the longest night .
london 's leading pair , as if piqued by this , turned 30 september into the longest afternoon .
on and on it dragged .
lacking a goal that might have altered its chemistry , it remained a matter of dull physics .
yet many of the crowd were kept interested by the possibility of victory , which is , i suppose , what derbies are about .
they are so frequent these days in london , which has eight of 20 first division clubs , that we must expect aesthetic considerations to be overridden .
why , though , could these supposed championship contenders not have tried to emulate the fine passing that had sprinkled the previous weekend 's merseyside joust ?
the simple answer is that chelsea are in a false position and arsenal , on this evidence , slightly jaded champions .
they ought to have pocketed three points in the first half-hour but tony adams , a more threatening centre-forward on his forays than the current alan smith , missed the target with two headers and david rocastle let dave beasant save a penalty , much as the stretch-version keeper had done for wimbledon in the 1988 fa cup final .
now an arsenal team in peak health would have kept a grip on the match .
this one could not .
as george graham indicated upon his side 's accession to the title , they would need more composure and sophistication to match liverpool in the longer term .
he chose not to hasten the process by buying .
after all , he had just the man on his staff .
but paul davis remains unfit .
his absence is increasingly conspicuous and liverpool , for the moment , in a super league of one .
davis , of course , would have walked into england 's team in poland a week on wednesday ; until last season 's prolonged suspension , followed by injury , bobby robson had him firmly pencilled in as bryan robson 's replacement .
michael thomas , several years younger , is not quite in the same class yet but may have to play in chorzow .
if so , it will be a gamble , because he flopped on his only previous international appearance in saudi arabia .
the odds are favourable enough according to chelsea 's mike hazard , who said of his adversary : â€˜ he could cope in poland , not just because of his ability to close people down and use the ball well , but temperament â€” you saw when he scored the goal that won arsenal the league . â€™
very kind , but international players are supposed to be habitually influential , and it was hazard who in the second half , with a few incisive passes , gifts from the heavens on a day like this , left a greater mark .
chelsea might have won had the ball not kept turning into a mexican bean at kerry dixon 's feet .
campbell 's hard-working side are still trying to sort out their system , which involves a spare defender and , as far as one can see , a good deal of improvisation .
it should suit tony dorigo , the unblooded england left-back , though oddly his rival , nigel winterburn , did more rampaging on saturday ; neither , in truth , made the heart pound .
dorigo at least had the satisfaction of seeing his direct opponent and england colleague david rocastle withdrawn .
all in all , bobby robson must have found it about as fruitful as a day trying to get in touch with brian clough .
there was , however , one aspect that deserves commendation .
after 16 minutes graham roberts was injured by a tackle for which perry groves was booked ( steve clarke took over as sweeper , and is likely to have several weeks in which to build on a promising display ) .
roberts 's ankle appeared broken , but the chelsea players were not interested in retribution and the club , as soon as they knew the injury was less serious , put a message on the electronic scoreboard : an example of public relations from which others could learn .
pope rejects runcie 's vision of church leadership
from andrew brown , religious affairs correspondent , in rome
the archbishop of canterbury , dr robert runcie , exchanged a symbolic kiss of peace with pope john paul ii yesterday at a mass attended by thousands in st peter 's square , rome .
but dr runcie 's ideas of a limited primacy â€” recognising the pope as a central figure in the christian church , who would exercise â€˜ a primacy for the sake of unity and mission â€™ â€” have been rejected as insufficient by the pope .
they have also aroused protestant anger against dr runcie , at the same time as he has become involved in a row over his attack on the â€˜ pharisees â€™ of british society .
though dr runcie and his party could not take holy communion at the papal mass , he had earlier celebrated the eucharist at the anglican church in rome after three demonstrators rose from the congregation as he ascended the pulpit ; the visit has been dogged by protests from supporters of the rev ian paisley .
in his sermon , dr runcie said : â€˜ we should ever recognise the scandal that anglicans and roman catholics must celebrate two eucharists to make one memorial of our redemption on the day of our lord . â€™
dr runcie has gone out of his way on this visit to concede many of the doctrinal points and practices which large elements of the church of england have traditionally found offensive in roman catholicism .
the pope , too , has spoken warmly of unity .
on saturday the two prelates attended a service of vespers at the church of san gregorio , which stands on the site where pope gregory sent st augustine of canterbury off to become the first archbishop of canterbury in 597 .
but in their prepared homilies the pope and the archbishop addressed quite different problems .
dr runcie repeated his offer of a limited primacy , involving the limited powers exercised by the popes in the first few centuries of the christian church .
however , the pope 's account of the role of the papacy went a great deal farther than that : christian unity , he said , must be founded on the faith in christ that was handed on by the apostles ; what this faith is must be determined by the roman catholic church .
he quoted the second vatican council : â€˜ the task of giving an authentic interpretation of the word of god â€¦ has been entrusted to the living teachting office of the church alone .
the specific role of bishops which is to be exercised in communion with the see of peter in ensuring the unity and continuity of the faith is vital if we are to hand on the faith of peter , gregory and augustine .
all our efforts to restore unity among christians will be in vain if they are not carried out in total fidelity to the faith in christ â€¦ handed on by the apostles . â€™
in a statement afterwards dr runcie stressed that he was not proposing any change in the british constitution .
â€˜ the phrase â€˜ universal primacy â€™ has a spiritual meaning .
it does not imply political supremacy , and does not suggest that the pope should administer the affairs of the church of england , â€™ he said .
both prelates referred to the consecration in february of the rt rev barbara harris as the anglican assistant bishop of massachussetts .
bishop harris is quite unacceptable to the vatican .
the pope said : â€˜ events in recent years have seriously aggravated the differences between us . â€™
the independent has learnt that 1,800 american roman catholic nuns wrote last winter to dr runcie , urging him to defy the pope over the ordination of women .
sister margaret traxler , of the national coalition of american nuns , said that she had told dr runcie : â€˜ the roman catholic church says this is a deterrent to unity ; but we say , how can this be a deterrent to unity when discrimination against women is evil ? â€™
she said she had received a â€˜ friendly and brotherly â€™ reply from dr runcie .
labour â€˜ would keep tight rein on spending â€™
by anthony bevins , political editor
john smith , the shadow chancellor , yesterday set the overriding tone for this week 's labour party conference with a warning that he would impose tough spending controls if labour won the next election .
his warning casts doubt on labour 's commitment to increase spending on â€˜ priority â€™ programmes for the health service and pensions .
mr smith said in an interview on bbc television 's on the record that he did not expect his colleagues to â€˜ spend and spend again' when they took office .
he conceded that there would be disputes with colleagues , but said : â€˜ there are no quick fixes , and i will not be indulging in any quick fix .
a quick fix clearly becomes unfixed .
there are realities that i can not change .
there will be the reality of the economic situation which we inherit , which will not be our fault , but it will be our responsibility .
when we 've got an economic mess , the first duty of a government is to clear up the economic mess .
â€˜ now if that means we have to postpone some of our social ambitions , then we may have to do so .
but it will not mean that we are abandoning them .
we will tackle putting our economy in order so that we can achieve that social ambition , so that the strong economy is used to finance and develop the fair society . â€™
as for his colleagues , mr smith said : â€˜ we 're all agreed that we can not spend what we have not earned and we intend to earn it before we spend it .
that will be the guiding light of the next labour government .
when i insist on that priority , as i can tell you i most certainly will â€” with the full support of the prime minister in doing so â€” then i 'm sure my colleagues will see the point of that .
â€˜ now it is quite right of them , of course , to allow our social obligations not to be forgotten ; there 'll probably be an argument .
there are in all governments between the treasury and spending ministers .
but they will take into account the need for that balance that says that social spending without underpinning by economic growth will not be sustained in any event . â€™
mr smith 's warning coincided with a call by ken livingstone , the labour mp for brent east , who said on london weekend television 's the walden interview : â€˜ you can be miles ahead in the polls , but when you get to the last three weeks , people think , â€˜ can i afford a labour government ? â€™
we need to say now what we are going to spend : where the money is going to come from . â€™
mr livingstone called for cuts in defence spending .
david blunkett , another member of the national executive , told a conference fringe rally organised by the soft-left labour coordinating committee that labour would have to find additional funds for its social programme by cutting â£9.5bn from defence spending over five years , and raising the level of taxation on the rich .
the policy review 's top rate of income tax - 50 per cent â€” was too low , he said .
although the policy review will be endorsed by the conference , giving neil kinnock the freedom to go on to the offensive against the conservatives in the run-up to the next general election , there are a number of areas of potential conflict .
calls for consideration of electoral reform and a new form of black representation are both expected to be defeated .
ron todd , the general secretary of the transport workers ' union , said that today 's vote on the multilaterist nuclear defence policy would not yield the â€˜ massive and overwhelming â€™ majority predicted by right-wingers , and he warned that party leaders could not expect everybody to â€˜ goose-step â€™ in the same direction once the policy had been carried .
the conference opened with labour buoyed by a series of weekend opinion polls giving leads of from 5 to 12 points .
health update : crack connection with aids
by olivia timbs
there is much concern in the us about the addiction to â€˜ crack â€™ ( purified cocaine ) within inner-city communities .
doctors are worried that women turning to prostitution to finance the habit are at risk of contracting aids .
this problem has spread to the uk .
in the past two months , doctors at the regional addiction treatment unit in birmingham have come across five patients addicted to crack .
three are prostitutes introduced to the drug by pimps .
according to them , crack is widely available in birmingham and most prostitutes they know use it daily .
the doctors point out in the british medical journal that , though crack dependency is not a direct risk factor for aids , prostitutes â€˜ trying to maintain expensive crack habits may be tempted into unsafe sex practices â€¦ which in turn may lead to an increase in the spread of aids â€™ .
health update : zinc deficiency in pregnancy
by olivia timbs
fads for vitamin supplements have been overtaken by a vogue for minerals and trace elements .
zinc is the latest : lack of it supposedly causes a range of problems , although little scientific evidence supports the link .
but some reports have suggested that low zinc levels may lead to problems in pregnancy , from difficult labour to congenital malformations in children .
there is stronger evidence that a zinc deficiency may cause the foetus to grow slowly in the womb .
doctors in bristol decided to test the theory .
in a study of nearly 500 women , they found that zinc supplements did not improve either foetal health or reduce the number of pre-term labours .
the doctors conclude in the british medical journal that there would be little benefit if all women in the uk were given zinc supplements during pregnancy .
they recognise , however , that the women in their study were largely middle-class , who might well have sufficiently large zinc stores because they were well nourished .
further studies , the researchers believe , should concentrate on pregnant women known to have a zinc deficiency or to be at risk from problems during labour .
health : alternative cures â€˜ not proven â€™

renee henry underwent a lumpectomy and radiotherapy for her breast cancer .
dr maurice slevin , a consultant physician at the department of medical oncology at st bartholomew 's hospital , london , said the chances of a woman being alive and well four years after such treatment were at least 75 per cent .
mrs henry refused the drug treatment given to reduce the chances of a relapse , but there are many who would remain well without it , dr slevin said .
part of the attraction of alternative cancer treatments such as the gerson therapy is that they allow a patient to feel more in control of the treatment .
dr slevin agreed that this is often beneficial , but is concerned about other aspects of such therapies .
very few have been evaluated , and the evidence is largely anecdotal , he said .
some of the treatments have dramatic side-effects .
â€˜ if they do work , that is wonderful â€” but we have no way of knowing for sure .
there have been no controlled trials of the gerson therapy .
â€˜ if one of my patients wants to give up a potentially curative treatment in favour of an alternative therapy , then i will try to dissuade them .
but it is essentially upm_to the patient . â€™
he said the nhs should address itself more to the needs of cancer patients so that they do not feel they have to go outside the system .
they should be offered relaxation therapy and stress management , and advice on diet and exercise , he said .
the imperial cancer research fund and the cancer research campaign are conducting a joint study of the bristol cancer help centre , which offers a holistic programme â€” dietary advice and emotional counselling â€” to complement medical treatment .
media : return of the six-gun saga : modern actors can not ride and young viewers do not understand the cowboy code , but a revival of the western looms on the horizon , john lichfield says
by john lichfield
where are the tv westerns of yesteryear ?
what happened to ben cartwright , hoss and little joe ?
where is the wagon train that seemed permanently to be circling its wagons waiting for a drunken pioneer 's wife to have twins in the last of them ?
the tv western seemed to fade into the sunset some time in the mid-1970s , victim of a narcissistic age that preferred to look at prosperous , smart-alecky or violent images of itself ( dallas , cheers , miami vice ) .
it was a time when children were encouraged to fantasize about machines and outer space rather than marvel at the open spaces where the deer and buffalo roamed .
now , however , it seems , the wheel has turned full circle .
the western is being revived , reinterpreted for the 1990s .
one of the most successful hollywood tv producers , david jacobs , the creator of dallas , believes the western also fell victim to late 1960s iconoclasm .
â€˜ the john wayne stereotype was rejected , along with his conservative values , â€™ he said .
a series of spoof or obsessively realistic 1960s westerns ( cat balou , butch cassidy and the sundance kid , soldier blue , the wild bunch ) stripped the mask from the lone ranger 's face .
the legend could not be taken seriously any longer in what had been , admittedly , a threadbare form .
howard rosenberg , tv critic of the los angeles times , said : â€˜ just look at the re-runs of the old western series .
you had heroes scotch-taped to their horses and lightly sprinkled with dust .
you ca n't get away with that any more . â€™
john mantley , producer of gunsmoke for cbs for 11 years , says elements of the old story began to fall apart .
â€˜ we all read bury my heart at wounded knee .
we knew that the us government had signed 453 treaties with the indians and broken every one .
a part of the myth just did n't work after that . â€™
at their peak in the mid-60s , there were 39 western series on the three american tv networks â€” almost two a day on each channel .
in the us weekly audience ratings in 1965 , there were three westerns in the top five , and seven in the top 10 .
by the mid-80s they had all gone the way of the buffalo : extinct save for preservation in the national park of permanent re-runs .
gene autry , the first tv cowboy , now 82 , says westerns dominated the early days of tv partly because they had lively , cheaply produced visuals , but mainly because early tv was starved of feature films by the studios .
westerns were a handy substitute .
there are encouraging signs , however , that the tv western is struggling back into the saddle .
paradise , launched on cbs last season and shown on bbc1 this summer , was the first new western serial for a decade .
it was the only new drama series in us network tv to be allowed a second series this year , despite a relatively lowly 49th ranking in the ratings .
its creator and executive producer is , perhaps surprisingly , david jacobs .
why did he follow j r ewing , the epitome of 1980s tv , with a western about a gunfighter turned foster father ?
â€˜ i believed the genre was still an important and powerful one .
it 's something i 've always had an affection for .
i found it was possible with paradise to talk about individual and personal responsibility , something which if set in a contemporary context would have had a preachy feel about it . â€™
lonesome dove , a five-part story of a texas-to-montana cattle drive , also shown on cbs last year , was the best-watched tv mini-series of any kind in america for five years .
it won substantial critical acclaim and will show in britain next year .
the 1989-90 season , which started this month , brought another new prime-time western series , abc 's young riders , which tells the story of the pony express .
it also says a lot about modern american tv .
because the networks believe westerns appeal mainly to middle-aged men , young riders has a cast of five pouting young male actors , in an attempt to make a western with â€˜ good demographics â€™ .
the effect is rather like an extended advertisement for marlboro lights .
westerns are no longer a cheap option .
the classic western tv series were filmed in back-lots , or in the semi-desert 20 miles from los angeles .
modern audiences no longer accept plastic bushes , and the southern californian suburban sprawl means the production companies have to take their horses and cows to locations far away in arizona or montana .
david jacobs also points out that the cost of hiring a stage-coach is now prohibitive .
â€˜ at one time there were dozens of companies which specialised in renting out western paraphernalia .
now there are maybe two .
the cost has gone through the barn roof . â€™
and actors can no longer ride .
they have to be sent to â€˜ cowboy school â€™ .
westerns , by their nature , demand more time on location .
as a result , mr jacobs says , it cost nearly as much to make an episode of paradise , with relatively unknown actors , as an episode of dallas , with its big stars .
will the western ride again ?
john mantley is cautious .
â€˜ westerns have a gladiatorial , timeless quality .
on the other hand you have a whole generation of tv watchers that does n't really know the rules .
a western is like a japanese noh play .
it is a stylised drama with understated dialogue that depends on recognition of key words and concepts .
many of the young people today have n't the first idea of what 's going on . â€™
in the inert 1950s the western represented a troubled , adventurous american past .
in the anxious and eventful late 1980s and 1990s , they may come to represent , like all creatures great and small in britain , a less confusing past with simpler , deeper values .
maybe .
on the other hand the young riders came 51st in the ratings in its first week , trailing far , far behind all the modern myths about modern times such as the cosby show , roseanne , golden girls , cheers and matlock .
it is premature , then , to say that the western has galloped back to centre screen .
but there is a puff of dust on the horizon .
motoring : a lead-free lover 's guide to used cars : drivers with a tight budget and an environmental conscience can buy second-hand without losing principles , says james ruppert
by james ruppert
from this month , all new cars submitted for british type approval , the test which allows them to be legally sold in the uk , must be able to run on lead-free petrol .
as a result of this rule , and many carefully orchestrated publicity campaigns , the motor industry 's image has now changed from polluter to pal of the earth .
if you can afford an environmentally friendly g-registered runabout , then the flora , fauna and children of the british isles will have a lot to thank you for .
but if you have a tight budget and a conscience , running older cars on lead-free fuel becomes a much more complicated issue .
without the presence of a lead compound , an engine 's valve seats go unprotected .
this leads to premature wear and plumes of blue smoke spewing from the exhaust .
the only effective remedy is to install hardened valve seats or a replacement cylinder head , both expensive options .
less costly , but not entirely satisfactory , is the practice of making every fourth tankful leaded petrol , which protects the valve seats but rather defeats the object .
alternatively there are several chemical additives on the market which aim to provide a substitute for lead , although the case for these products has yet to be proved .
however , many cars built within the last few years have hardened valve seats , or alloy cylinder heads that need little ( simply a retune ) or no modification to use unleaded petrol .
finding out which cars can and which can not is not difficult .
esso filling stations have a free booklet listing most models produced since 1980 , as does the charity clear ( 01-387 4970 ) , with more detail available in the unleaded petrol guide ( autodale , â£2.99 ) .
looking at those lists provides interesting reading and bears out the used-car trade 's view that having a lead-only car could prove to be a liability .
it is not as if four-star leaded fuel is going to be phased out tomorrow , but more and more buyers are asking : â€˜ does it take unleaded ? â€™
what is certain is that the pre-1989 austin/mg range , all skodas , yugos and quite a few lancias do not , which does not help already depressed resale prices .
a 1985 lancia y10 ( lead only ) sells for around â£2,000 whereas the similar fiat uno 55 from the same year , converted to run on unleaded , is worth around â£500 more .
a lead-only second-hand car is now worth about 10 per cent less than an unleaded equivalent .
in years to come the percentage difference is likely to be much larger .
even so , exotica such as lead-only porsche 911s and ferraris are unlikely to be part of this trend , so no bargains there i 'm afraid .
more impressive are the japanese manufacturers whose cars dating from the early eighties can run on unleaded without adjustment .
find a 1980 toyota corolla or 1982 nissan sunny that has not succumbed to rust , and you can buy with confidence .
on the home front , most fords and vauxhalls from at least the mid-eighties can use unleaded .
if the â€˜ greenness â€™ of going unleaded still seems a bit of a grey area , it is possible to switch to diesel without a shadow of environmental doubt .
diesel always has been lead-free and the only adjustments you need to make are mental ones , because diesel-powered cars are no longer slow , smelly or noisy .
they also return more miles to the gallon than their petrol equivalents , although service intervals are shorter .
but after the publicity on unleaded fuel there has been increased interest in used diesel power .
but remember that these cars accrue , and can withstand , significantly higher mileages than petrol cars , 50-90,000 being the norm .
the tradition for diesel cars is far better established on the continent and that is where the best buys come from .
perhaps the most successful maker is peugeot , with a complete range of cars from the small 205 â€” around â£3,000 for a 90,000-mile 1985 car â€” to the legendary 504 estate , about â£2,000 for a 1982 example .
the germans are also fairly accomplished manufacturers , although a five-door 1980 golf with a six-figure mileage will still cost â£1,500 .
prestige comes in the shape of a mercedes with the 240d or â€˜ stuttgart taxi â€™ , commanding â£7,000 but returning unfailing reliability .
even if lead levels in the atmosphere do not bother you , i am sure you will find the fact that unleaded petrol is 15p cheaper , and that diesel fuel boosts mpg by at least a third , most interesting .
auctions : dazzling riches of the orient
by roger bell
it is asian week at sotheby 's and christie 's .
they are mixing islamic art from the middle east with indian and south-east asian .
the sales combine items of charm at fairly accessible prices with some rare treasures aimed at big-time collectors .
homely persian pottery of the twelfth to thirteenth century combines animal and bird images with sinuous plant motifs and marks the beginning of lustre wares ; they are mostly priced in the â£500 to â£1,000 range and rate high on charm .
the iznik pottery from turkey dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth century explodes with colour on more sophisticated white grounds ; iznik is now highly sought after by turkish yuppies and prices run from â£2,000 or so to â£15,000 .
both houses combine elegant early metalwares ( twelfth/thirteenth century ) , bronze vessels with silver inlay â€” which are expensive â€” with nineteenth- century imitations , more flashy but in the mid-hundreds .
there are plenty of indian miniatures , colourful and charming evocations of princely courts , priced in hundreds or low thousands .
stone figures chipped off the war-torn temples of cambodia are more expensive ; a striking khmer figure will cost â£20,000 or more .
there are also outstanding bits of indian stone monuments , with gods and goddesses sensuously entwined in spiritual embrace ; they start with the gandhara grey schist carvings of the third/fourth century .

drink : desire in search of a name : do the french have the â€˜ mot juste â€™ to describe the desire for a reviving drink ?
in the first of a monthly series , michael jackson hunts in vain
by michael jackson
thank god it 's saturday .
i know that today is saturday because already i am thirsty for a dry , hoppy pint of bitter at the end of the afternoon : an aperitif to sharpen my appetite for this evening 's indian meal .
how did you feel as you came to the end of your working week yesterday afternoon ?
boy , i had a thirst .
we say we are thirsty when we mean that we fancy a glass of wine , a pint of beer , a gin and tonic or a shot of whisky â€” the pleasure of naming our poison â€” at the end of a busy day or tiresome week .
that is not thirst .
to enjoy it , we do not need to be dry : just in need of a restorative or relaxant , or maybe a focus for a social moment or brief encounter .
we call it â€˜ thirst â€™ in lieu of a more accurate description .
no , not more accurate : â€˜ thirst â€™ is not accurate at all as a description for this apparently indescribable condition .
it is a desire millions of us know and share , yet for which we have no name .
this desire that can not find its name ( though it would dare speak it , if it could ) is pleasurable .
it is as enjoyable as feeling gently hungry or amorous .
no , not amorous : randy â€” we have a word for that .
any of these conditions is pleasurable so long as there is a good likelihood of satisfaction in reasonably short order .
let puritans and pessimists damn , disapprove or dismiss these appetites ; that is their loss .
those of us who enjoy them need only a name for each condition , so that we may discuss them in expectation and in recollection .
come to think of it , neither hunger nor randiness hits quite the spot .
peckishness and lust , perhaps ?
or does that sound like a firm of country solicitors ?
this is to digress .
what of this thirst that can be satisfied by an unquenching drink ?
wine is not quenching , but no less in demand for that .
try to quench your thirst with a light , fresh white and you will drink enough to put you on your back .
beer is , quite rightly , britain 's favourite friday night drink .
it can momentarily blunt a thirst , but not altogether cut it .
the nearest to being quenching is the â€˜ white â€™ beer of berlin .
anything with even a modest smack of hops dries the palate ready for the next one .
so , of course , does alcohol itself .
it may for a moment seem to quench but it dehydrates , as purportedly healthy abstainers are forever telling me .
to quench is more than to refresh although our lying , lascivious eyes tell us the two are the same .
does any drink look more quenching than one of those italian or french patent aperitifs , swirling in a refractive pink or russet oiliness , clothing the melting ice : a campari , dubonnet , lillet or ( too rare in this country ) a picon ?
are they quenching ?
no , refreshing .
in strasburg , they have been known to lace beer with picon , thereby ruining both drinks ( as queen victoria reputedly did with claret and malt whisky ) , but still the result is not especially quenching .
perhaps a shimmering dry martini cocktail ( minimum dilution , stirred , not shaken ; and served straight up ) looks even more refreshing , though its effect is that of a silver mallet .
in the right place ( possibly new york , but san francisco is better ) , the martini is the ultimate â€˜ thank god it 's friday â€™ drink .
the requirement for such pleasures is a matter of time and place , and it does not have to be friday , berlin or strasburg , new york or san francisco .
not feeling thirsty , but fancying a drink , has a world of moments .
some frenchmen start the day with a coffee and calvados .
the people of munich call their version of weissbier â€˜ breakfast beer â€™ and have it with a pair of coddled veal sausages .
new orleans favours a mid-morning milk punch , or its own variation on the gin fizz .
if the moment is before a lunch on the plane , it really ought to be a bloody mary .
if it is at an elegant dinner table , there is a choice between a fino sherry ( or a manzanilla ) or champagne .
none of these requires anything even approaching a thirst .
do we really â€˜ wash down â€™ a good meal with claret ?
port is immediately suggested by stilton ; cognac by coffee .
i do not fully appreciate the experience of an american late-night movie without a bourbon , or a book at bedtime without a single malt .
these are not moments of thirst â€¦ but nor are they causes of drunkenness ( unless one tries to pack all such experiences into one day ) .
we do not drink because we are thirsty .
nor , if we are in civilised cast of mind , because we wish to become drunk .
a friend of mine says that her body tells her , without being asked , the season of the year .
at the end of summer , her body stops wanting gin and tonics and suddenly desires whisky .
if it were only a matter of alcohol , would a body care ?
people will nevertheless say that the desire is for nothing more than alcohol .
so why not a pill or an injection ?
because there would be no colour , no ritual , no time and place , no glorious variety .
worst of all , there would be no aroma , taste , texture or finish .
these are sensuous pleasures at their most enjoyable when we ritualise them , but how do we feel when we desire them ?
we , who have so many words in our language , have none for this .
but then , do the french , spanish or italians have a word for it ?
perhaps they do ; maybe i have not being paying attention ; too busy with the eau-de-vie , anis or grappa .
do the greeks have a word for it ?
could we borrow , beg or invent one ?
answers in a bottle , please .
if you are feeling â€” for lack of a better word -thirsty , let's meet again next month .
same time , same place ?
it will be my turn to get them in , i think .
in the garden : planning to beat a leafy retreat at home : in the first of a series for novice gardeners , anna pavord stresses the value of careful forethought
by anna pavord
plants should come a long way down the list of priorities for the novice gardener .
there are many things to think about before even the first tentative daffodil bulb is sunk into the ground .
the first and most important question to mull over as you gaze at your patch is : what is this garden for ?
if you start writing down some of the responses to that question , you will find you have along the way acquired a ragbag of elements that will have an important bearing on the design .
if there are small children in the equation , there will need to be a flat , soft area where they can fall off swings and climbing frames .
if you like hanging out washing rather than drying it in the bowels of an expensive machine , you will need to tuck away a line and make a dry path to get to and from it .
some novice gardeners may not want to do much actual gardening at all , but conversely , do not want to look out every day over a scene of threadbare grass and rotting fence .
their ideal garden will look good and demand little attention .
if you are a dedicated sun-worshipper , you need to mark out the part of the garden where the sun lingers longest .
it may not be the part nearest the house , though this is where sitting out areas always tend to be made .
you may , even as a novice , care so passionately about plants that all you want is the maximum space to grow them in .
raised beds built down an unpromising alley could provide extra gardening space .
privacy is an important consideration .
a first time garden is usually small and certainly the typical one i am imagining for this series is no more than 40ft x 20ft and surrounded on all sides by other houses .
privacy is a ticklish business where close neighbours are concerned .
to throw up an impenetrable berlin wall between you and them could be tactless .
trellis is a useful compromise and you can always pretend it was forced on you by the speed of growth of your climbing rose .
aesthetes among the novices will by now be thoroughly irritable and complaining that gardens should have as much to do with the soul as with the necessity or not of a washing line or a barbecue pit .
so they should , and when the list of necessities is securely written down , you can ask the second question : how do i want this garden to feel ?
this question produces as varied a response as the first .
some urban gardeners , as short of space inside as they are out , want their gardens to be extensions of their homes , with a great deal of hard paving , good furniture and lighting .
the garden for them should feel like an extra sitting room , gnat-ridden perhaps , damp occasionally , but an important overflow of living space .
closet countrysiders may want to pretend their patch is actually a corner of some sussex meadow and picture it swagged with honeysuckle and waving with ox-eye daisies and scabious .
this is a difficult trick to bring off with suburban trains hurtling by on one side and lorries grinding through their gears on the other .
a leafy retreat is an excellent goal for a small town garden , but it is best made acknowledging the urban setting , using un-wild plants such as bamboo , acanthus , fig , vine , alchemilla , euphorbia , wisteria .
while you are working through this process , take note of the features in the garden that you would like to keep .
on a new estate , there may be nothing .
in an old garden , there may be a fruit tree , or a good bulwark of evergreen laurel or box that , tidied up , could add a dash of venerability to the new garden that will emerge around it .
if you do not know what a tree or shrub is , exercise clemency and give it a year 's grace to demonstrate its worth before you turn it over to the axeman .
the mood of the garden will dictate its eventual style .
it may be clipped classical , random cottage , modern high-tech , or some intensely personal vision of byzantium , that no one has ever imagined before , but which exists in your head and wants to get out .
do not let anybody , particularly gardening writers , tread on your dreams .
all this thinking and doodling will have done nothing physically to change the view outside the window , but it is a vital part of the gardening process .
before you can make , you have to know what it is you are making .
property : houses that are going , going , gone : fed up with trying to sell , more people are auctioning their home instead .
andrew bibby reports
by andrew bibby
in the small devon town of south molton , julie widlake is waiting with anticipation for friday 20 october .
she and her boyfriend have had their future planned for some time : they want to start farming in a nearby village , where they also intend to build a bungalow .
first , they have to sell their present house , a two-bedroom cottage in the centre of the town .
as is the case almost everywhere else , the market in devon is depressed and selling has not been easy .
so instead of waiting indefinitely for a buyer , they have decided to try selling their house by auction .
it comes under the hammer at 2.15pm on the 20th , at the barnstaple motel .
â€˜ we accept that we might not get very much for it , but on the other hand we could get more , â€™ says julie widlake .
â€˜ we 've been waiting to move for a long time , and we need the money to build the new house . â€™
their south molton cottage ( guide price â£44,000-â£46,000 ) is one of more than 20 lots to be put up for sale at the barnstaple auction by bristol and west property services , and one of more than a hundred which the building society subsidiary will be auctioning in eight west country venues over a three-day period .
bristol and west claims these auctions will help to bring some action to an otherwise slow market , and says it was overwhelmed by the response from people wanting to sell in this way .
auctions certainly speed up the house-buying process .
once the hammer has fallen , the successful bidder for a house must exchange contracts immediately and pay a deposit .
completion normally takes place four to eight weeks later and there is no opportunity for second thoughts .
as the bristol and west explains , if a bidder does not sign the contract , the auctioneer can sign on their behalf .
â€˜ from the vendor 's point of view , the house is actually sold once a successful bid is made , â€™ says graham harrison , director of bristol and west property services .
â€˜ many people have suffered from sales falling through and from house-buying chains , and some of our vendors feel that now 's as good a time as any to sell . â€™
from the purchasers ' point of view , auctions can also be attractive â€” if slightly nerve-racking as you wait for bidding to start for the house of your dreams .
the problem is that normally potential purchasers have to incur the expense of undertaking surveys and arranging mortgage finance , without any idea whether they will be able to afford the final selling price .
not surprisingly , several estate agents report difficulties at the moment in attracting enough serious bidders .
â€˜ with an auction , you 've got to be certain that at least two buyers are there who can commit themselves , and the difficulty is that buyers who can proceed are few and far between , â€™ said david phillip , a director of yorkshire estate agents dacre son and hartley .
bristol and west hopes that by arranging collective auctions it will be able to overcome this problem .
it is also guaranteeing mortgages at 1 per cent below the normal interest rate , for endowment or pension-linked policies , on several of the houses up for sale , an interesting and innovative service for would-be bidders ( mortgage surveys will already have been undertaken for these houses ) .
the building society will be staffing a mortgage desk at each auction , and says buyers could arrange finance there and then , subject of course to proof of income and status .
obviously , however , bristol and west hopes to hear from interested people in advance â€” if only so it can gauge the likely demand for each property before the auction starts .
â€˜ we 're trying to smooth the path for purchasers , and streamline the system , â€™ says graham harrison , pointing out that live telephone bidding will also be available for those unable to attend .
holiday homes and commercial property have been included among the lots to be auctioned .
although collective property auctions take place regularly in london ( often primarily for investors rather than house-hunters ) , in country areas the more typical auction will be just for one house , and as likely as not will take place in a nearby pub or village hall .
in fact , country auctions are often the nearest many villages get to live theatre .
â€˜ the locals come for the entertainment , and to see who 's buying into their village , â€™ observed one auction-goer .
pub landlords are usually only too happy to provide free accommodation .
â€˜ it 's very exciting and gets the adrenalin going , â€™ says david phillip , whose firm usually undertakes auctions in the otley area .
only certain types of property normally come to auction , however .
traditionally , country cottages and houses which have unusual or unique features or are in need of a lot of renovation may be auctioned , if only because valuation is likely to be difficult .
sometimes , too , houses have to be sold by auction to satisfy the legal requirements of trustees or executors ( auctions provide adequate proof that the property has been sold at the going market value , and protect trustees from future claims of negligence ) .
less happily , but for the same reason , repossessed houses are often auctioned .
anyone considering selling by auction needs to be aware that the costs involved will be higher .
advertising costs and any expenses incurred in hiring premises are normally passed on by the estate agents to the vendor , whether or not the auction results in a sale .
in addition , agents may charge slightly more commission than usual for a successful sale .
in bristol and west 's forthcoming auctions , a set fee of â£375 plus vat will be charged to everyone entering property to sell , with its usual agent 's commission ( about 2 per cent plus vat ) charged on top when sales are made .
â€˜ we accept that we could lose the money we 've paid to go to auction , but that 's a risk we 're prepared to take , â€™ says julie widlake .
the secret of a successful outcome depends partly on setting the right reserve price , a task the auctioneer undertakes in conjunction with the seller .
normally , the reserve is set only days or hours before the auction , when the agents will already have a good indication of how much interest has been shown .
too high a reserve price can mean no sale , and disappointment all round .
â€˜ you need to understand what your clients â€™ expectations are beforehand , â€™ says graham harrison of bristol and west .
agents and their clients may also have the dilemma of deciding whether to accept any offers made prior to the auction .
inevitably they do not always get it right .
peter crowther , managing director of a leeds business centre , recently bought two semi-detached stone cottages in bramhope , on the outskirts of leeds , at an auction in the village pub .
his successful bid was for â£190,000 although he had made a higher prior offer which had been turned down .
on the other hand , sometimes the drama of the auction and the competition between bidders can have the opposite effect .
another recent auction in leeds saw a run-down stone farmhouse without water or other amenities finally fall under the hammer for â£330,500 .
â€˜ success is by no means guaranteed at auction , â€™ says graham harrison .
â€˜ in a tough market you need to get the programme right , the price right and have a little bit of luck . â€™
bristol and west property services ( 0272 294271 ) has produced a brochure covering all eight west country auctions .
the churches built on wool : angela lambert enjoys the riches at the heart of east anglia
by angela lambert
until six or seven years ago , outsiders associated east anglia with fens , flatness and the vanished edwardian nannies of frinton .
its old churches , green fields and long beaches were cherished by the inhabitants of essex , suffolk , norfolk and cambridgeshire , but not yet on the tourist agenda .
today , i was told , villagers living around the great wool churches of lavenham and long melford have to bar their doors and ignore the knocking of tourists , who take them for antique shops and offer to buy their furniture .
the tourists are right .
east anglia on a sunny weekend is a place of matchless beauty .
its villages look too good to be true .
lavenham and long melford , for example , have no telegraph poles , to preserve the timeless air that pervades them .
yet you only have to read ronald blythe 's akenfield to realise that these picturesque , half-timbered cottages , often painted the characteristic essex pink ( pale salmon ) , ochre or spring-leaf green , are more prosperous now than ever in the â€˜ real â€™ past .
many are still elaborately decorated with pargeting , an ornate , patterned plasterwork practised in this area since the early thirteenth century .
most of east anglia 's prosperity today is due to city commuters , the second-homes market and tourism .
the ideal hotel from which to explore is dedham hall , set among tall trees in the vale of dedham , looking directly across towards dedham church on one side and flatford mill on the other : both painted by constable .
the hotel lies in five acres of fields and garden , and the slingos , who own it , make the most of their beautiful surroundings by running painting courses for about â£200 a week ( including breakfast and dinner ) , or â£90 for a long weekend .

the other great joy of dedham hall is the food .
the slingos have their own vegetable garden , chickens , ducks , sheep and cows .
everything is home-grown , home-made and fresh : it tastes like forgotten food .
if dedham hall is fully booked â€” and it may well be â€” try the best bed-and-breakfast we have ever found , just a few miles away at the old vicarage , higham , near colchester .
it is a rambling tudor house run by john and margaret parker , whose breakfast room and drawing room look out over a wonderful walled garden , beyond which fields of grazing cows stretch down to the river .
another hotel that would make a good starting point for a weekend â€” or longer â€” in east anglia is the black lion at long melford .
it changed hands recently and is now run by stephen and janet errington .
after dinner there , when the moon was full and low and deep orange , we walked up the road from the hotel to long melford church .
its vast walls of flint and glass and gothic tracery were brilliantly floodlit and the churchyard cat , sleek and black as tar , greeted us querulously and led us right round the church and through the gravestones at the back , glimmering and pale in the moonlight .
we were quite alone and the great church , the size of a cathedral , was unearthly in its floodlit , moonlit beauty .
long melford is one of the wool churches that commemorate the wealth of east anglia in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries .
another is at lavenham , 10 minutes ' drive up the road .
just inside the front porch , a handwritten book is prefaced with the words â€˜ this book has been compiled that something , more than their mere names , may be known of the lavenham men who gave their lives for their country in the great war . â€™
this is followed by 50 or so names , each with a description .
the much-thumbed book is deeply moving , and sets the tone for a walk round this glorious building , which has seen the christenings , marriages and burials of the folk of the village for more than 600 years .
east anglia is exceptionally rich in churches and cathedrals .
there are several splendid houses near long melford that would make for a gentle afternoon 's potter through the rooms and possessions of the rich of a few centuries ago .
the loveliest , to my mind , is melford hall , whose charming , octagonal jacobean gatehouse is reached along an avenue of clipped yew trees and , with its high windows flooding the octagon with light , is my fantasy of the ideal study .
lavenham is often called the finest medieval village in england .
it is an image of the world we have lost , its gently sloping streets converging upon the market place .
here stand the early sixteenth-century timbered guildhall , now a museum to 700 years of the cloth industry .
next to it is the little hall , dating from the fourteenth century , with its floorboards gleaming with the patina of age , low-beamed ceilings and a tiny , unruly , charming walled garden .
precisely next door to this is a restaurant called the great house .
here , in the cool , pretty setting of the dining room that was once stephen spender 's , you will be served an exquisite three-course lunch for â£9.50 , â£6 for children .

a prayer for the brick cathedral facing st paul 's : bankside power station is a masterpiece worth , preserving , gavin stamp argues
by gavin stamp
from the top of the dome of st paul 's cathedral the view is no longer dominated by city church steeples but by an intrusive cacophony of drab , characterless sixties boxes .
one building stands out in this dispiriting panorama of post-war mediocrity : a dark powerful mass of brickwork with a tall central tower that stands right across the thames from wren 's dome .
this is not an office block , nor a church â€” although its sublime form might suggest that its architect was adept at designing cathedrals .
it is , in fact , the now redundant oil-fired electric power station that sits on bankside next to the site of sam wanamaker 's new globe theatre .
bankside power station should never have been built .
its architect had spent the war years with fellow royal academicians planning the orderly and spacious london of the future , free of smoke and industry .
but , when asked in 1947 to replace an old dirty power station that had been on the site since 1891 , he soon forgot such idealism and , like any architect , was glad to have the job .
the project was controversial and the power station was only permitted providing the smoke was clean and the building did not challenge the visual dominance of st paul 's .
so the single chimney rose only to 325ft , some 45ft below the height of the cross above the cathedral .
the irony is that had the tower been higher and had the teak â€˜ scrubbers â€™ been less efficient , the smoke would have gone straight up into the air .
as it was , the â€˜ smokeless shimmer of vapour â€™ was so cooled by cleaning that it drifted across the river to cause mischief with the leadwork on wren 's great dome .
bankside power station should not have been built .
but , as it was built , it should not now be demolished .
that is because it is a magnificent structure , the supreme architectural expression of the heroic , monumental phase of power station design and the creation of a great architect .
bankside was the work of sir giles gilbert scott , om , the architect of liverpool 's anglican cathedral , the rebuilt house of commons and some of the last vital products of the gothic revival .
he was a designer of extraordinary versatility , being responsible for the standard â€˜ traditional â€™ red telephone kiosk , waterloo bridge and several power stations .
bankside represents the fullest realisation of his industrial aesthetic .
scott 's first venture into this unlikely field of design was at battersea where , in 1930 , he was wheeled in as a famous knighted architect by the london power company to try to make acceptable the coal-fired monster power station to which the residents of chelsea and westminster were taking strong exception .
this was a brilliant move .
scott was so successful in styling the building in fine brickwork with â€˜ jazz-modern â€™ fluting ( as john betjeman called it ) that , when the battersea â€˜ a â€™ station was opened in 1934 it was widely acclaimed as a supremely successful modern treatment of a building type that seemed quintessentially twentieth century .
when , in 1939 , the architects ' journal conducted a survey to find what were considered the best modern buildings in britain , battersea was placed second â€” and was the favourite of such unlikely celebrities as sir kenneth clark , rebecca west and charles laughton .
scott was so pleased with the style he had evolved at battersea , a treatment that humanised industrial forms without denying their function , that he also used it on the guinness factory at park royal , west london .
at battersea , scott could not alter the basic design of the building and he much disliked the â€˜ upturned table â€™ appearance created by the four corner chimneys .
at bankside , however , he was able to persuade the engineers , mott , hay & anderson , to gather all the flues into a single â€˜ slender tower or campanile â€™ .
as a result , he was able to create a symmetrical , monumental composition of great power .
as at all his power stations , scott faced the building in a fine worcestershire brick that has weathered to a lovely pinky-brown .
but there is nothing homely about the general effect .
vast overlapping planes of brickwork are modelled with careful set-backs and subtle bands of detail .
the result is an expression of the monumental aesthetic of the early twentieth century , with strong american overtones .
when the campanile is seen from a distance , it seems to belong to some strange expressionist church one has not noticed before .
not for nothing were such power stations described as â€˜ brick cathedrals â€™ ; bankside is the finest manifestation of this tradition .
now it is redundant .
smoke shimmers no longer from the tall tower .
but bankside is nevertheless a sound structure which , like the best mills of the industrial revolution , is well worth preserving and is perfectly capable of adaptation for a new commercial use .
such re-use is , of course , much encouraged by a building being listed , something which , until recently , was not possible with architecture of so recent a date .
two years ago , however , the department of the environment at last began the listing of post-war buildings in england that were more than 30 years old .
bracken house , the former home of the financial times , became the first candidate and english heritage then submitted some 70 recommendations to the department of the environment ; these included bankside .
this , however , was too much for the government and , using the excuse that public opinion was not yet ready to accept the protection of many unpopular modern buildings , lord caithness , the minister of state for the environment , arbitrarily whittled down english heritage 's list to 18 buildings - excluding bankside â€” although it represented a more traditional approach in the fifties to the now-unfashionable modern movement .
however , caithness himself stated that this first selection was â€˜ in no way a definitive list â€¦
i have no doubt that others will be added .
the important thing is that the thirty year rule is in force and that we can respond to developing perceptions of our times . â€™
earlier this year , in my capacity as chairman of the thirties society , i asked caithness 's successor , virginia bottomley , to reconsider english heritage 's recommendation of bankside for listing .
my argument was that , as michael heseltine had so boldly listed battersea power station in 1980 , it was illogical not to protect a much finer and more complete industrial work by the same architect .
furthermore , the listing of battersea had ensured the building 's survival for conversion to a new use â€” in that case , as an entertainment centre which the prime minister herself had praised and inaugurated .
after two months ' silence , i was informed that ministers stood by their decision .
i wrote back asking the reasons for this , pointing out that , if any large modern power station deserved to be listed , it was bankside .
i have received no satisfactory reply .
of course , i know perfectly well why the department of the environment declines to list it .
listed building procedures might impede the full commercial realisation of the site when the electricity industry is privatised .
furthermore , british rail has its eyes on the bankside site for bringing up the spoil from the tunnel for channel traffic which it is , so absurdly , driving under the middle of london at astronomical cost .
listing , in theory , is an objective assessment of architectural or historical importance which does not necessarily prevent demolition .
in the case of bankside power station , the ultimate â€˜ temple of power â€™ and a masterpiece of industrial architecture by a major twentieth-century british architect , our historic building system is being perverted for purely political reasons .
â€˜ her dress hangs here' : de-frocking the kahlo cult
oriana baddeley
the 1990s have witnessed a shift in the art establishment 's attitudes towards art produced outside of its traditional parameters .
the work of previously marginalised artists has become an area of rich speculation among art dealers priced out of the â€˜ modern masters â€™ market .
almost every year has witnessed the discovery of new artistic terrain â€” graffiti art , soviet art , australian art , the art of latin america .
the major auction houses have moved with the times and have found new ways of selling works which in both form and content would have proved an unstable investment a decade ago .
the current status of the work of the mexican painter frida kahlo is a dramatic example of this change .
once known primarily as the wife of diego rivera , her reputation outside of mexico now far supercedes his : since 1919 , sale room estimates of her work have risen from $40,000 to over $1 million , and in 1990 a work by kahlo broke all records at sotheby 's new york for a latin american artist .
the enormous rise in the economic value of her work has developed in tandem with the increased critical and popular response to her particular blend of naive style and incisive content .
while the first wave of popular interest arose with the 1982 whitechapel exhibition instigated by laura mulvey and peter wollen , it was the publication of hayden herrera 's biography of kahlo in 1983 which has led to her current cult status .
since that date she has been the subject of tv documentaries , a feature film ( â€˜ frida â€™ by paul leduc ) , a stage play , numerous publications and the inspiration for designer clothing .
in may 1989 elle magazine ran a 16 page feature on frida kahlo as the â€˜ spirit of mexico â€™ ( fig. 1 ) , while in vogue ( feb. 1990 ) there was a 10 page interpretation of â€˜ the romance of frida kahlo 's mexico â€™ ( fig. 2 ) .
almost as a logical outcome of this media blitz , it emerged in the summer of 1990 that madonna , already a devotee of kahlo 's work , was commissioning a screenplay based on kahlo 's life .
fig. 1 .
elle magazine , may 1989 , p. 18â€“19 .
as with most artists who have become mythical personalities in the popular imagination , such attention has focused primarily on the anecdotal and tragic details of kahlo 's admittedly fascinating life .
the passionate obsession with her husband diego rivera , her flamboyant appearance , but most of all her physical and emotional pain have come to dominate responses to her work .
while kahlo 's art helped her to deal with the vicissitudes of her life , for most audiences it is her life story which allows access to her art .
in this one can draw obvious parallels to the appeal of van gogh , a traditionally popular artist recently made fashionable by the media attention generated during the centennial of his death .
the archetypal dropout/spiritualist became an appropriate icon for the sixties revival of 1990 'm_s long hot summer .
yet despite the iconic status of van gogh 's â€˜ tragic â€™ life , it is the appearance of his work by which he is ultimately signified , his thick impasto brush-stroke , his vibrant yellows , the urgency of his creative drive .
in the case of kahlo the popular image is of the artist herself , the characteristic brows , the elaborate hair , the mexican costume ( fig. 3 ) .
it is primarily her appearance , not the formal language of her art , that has graced the pages of elle and vogue magazines .
the elle feature transposed the â€˜ kahlo style â€™ to kahlo lookalikes in contemporary clothing balanced around segments of herrera 's biography of the artist .
in the later vogue piece only the style remained as the far more overtly sexual , kahloesque models lounged and pouted in their â€˜ mexican â€™ interiors .
there is a poignant irony in the way clothing , which on one level served to hide kahlo 's broken body , falls or is lifted by the model to reveal a luxuriantly perfect physique ( fig. 4 ) .
the visual references in the two magazines are as much from photos of the artist as from her work .
in both features she is also seen to embody a wider set of assumptions about mexico itself ; exotic , passionate , yet constantly struggling against pain and deceit .
while elle , vogue and subsequently the independent ( fig. 5 ) , stressed different facets of kahlo 's public persona , they all shared the emphasis on â€˜ her â€™ , as an encapsulisation of stereotypical images of mexico , rather than her work .
it is her body as the canvas , her appearance as art .
the art of self-expression becomes self-expression as art .

vogue , february 1990 , p. 130â€“1 .
fig. 3 .
elle magazine , may 1989 , p. 28 .
of course , the line between art and life is a particularly hard one to draw in kahlo 's case .
the majority of her work is self portraiture ; her aesthetic concerns grew from her fascination with the falsity of appearance .
dressing up , role playing and masquerade form the conceptual basis of kahlo 's work .
in self-portrait with cropped hair ( 1944 ) ( fig. 6 ) , she paints herself wearing rivera 's suit , challenging traditional expectations of femininity and attempting to appropriate his authority ( while simultaneously ) threatening castration ) .
more disturbingly , in the mask ( 1945 ) ( fig. 7 ) , she throws doubt on too straightforward a reading of her self-portraits as revealing of her inner emotions .
where does the mask fall : does not the ritual repetition of those familiar features â€˜ mask â€™ far more than it uncovers ?
there is , however , an inevitable logic to the appropriation of her meticulously constructed image , a process which the artist was mocking as early as 1933 : â€˜ â€¦ some of the gringa women are imitating me and trying to dress â€˜ a la mexicana â€™ , but the poor souls only look like cabbages and to tell you the naked truth they look absolutely impossible . '
the â€˜ impossibility â€™ stemmed from the failure of such followers to recognise the symbolic importance of kahlo 's choice of clothing , a failure also intrinsic to her recent magazine appearances .
the particularities of post-revolutionary mexico are frequently subsumed by the decorativeness of the ethnic , by the generalised attractiveness of the radical avant-garde .
for kahlo , however , choosing to don the costume of the tehuana , as for example in tree of hope ( 1946 ) ( fig. 8 ) , was to embody a powerful icon of cultural identity .
mexican indian dress is extraordinarily diverse and by and large geographically specific , varying from region to region .
the tehuana dress is by no means the most decorative variant or the closest to pre-hispanic forms of clothing .
it is the mythology surrounding the women wearers of the costume which directed kahlo 's choice .
the ostensibly matriarchal society of tehuantepec led to the adoption of the tehuana , in post-revolutionary mexico , as the image of the strong indian woman ; the undefeated counterpart to the despised â€˜ chingada â€™ , who , conversely is the female embodiment of mexico 's hybrid post-conquest culture .
in a culture where sexual metaphors are frequently used to convey racial and political conflict , the tehuana represents that aspect of mexico 's indigenous tradition unbowed by centuries of colonial and male rule .
kahlo 's adoption of tehuana dress , while being an attractive disguise of what she saw as a less than perfect body , asserted both a feminist and an anti-colonialist position .
fig. 4 .
vogue , february 1990 , p. 138 .
fig. 5 .
the independent on sunday , 8th april 1990 , p. 37 .
in kahlo 's work there is a powerful mix of these discourses , yet her role as an archetypal woman painter has come to dominate responses to her work .
it is through her emergence as a cult painter of the feminist movement of the 1970s that her current reputation has evolved .
her work almost perfectly illustrates debates as to the nature of traditional exclusions of a woman 's art .
the fascination with functions of the body , the analogies between artistic and physical creative processes , self-portraiture used to reveal the female body as the site of patriarchal aesthetic discourse ; all of these mirror the concerns of many women painters of the 1980s .

in their formal language , kahlo 's works are exemplary of certain feminist arguments ; the adoption of the decorative , the intimate and non-fine art mediums reveals the restrictive nature of traditional definitions of â€˜ high art â€™ .
this â€˜ appropriateness â€™ of kahlo 's aesthetic to contemporary debate has tended to remove her work from its historical context , to stress the collective and the cross-cultural .
although this is not in itself to be dismissed as a tactic , it has diminished the complexity of kahlo 's achievement as a specifically mexican painter , operating within the particularities of her historical moment .
more problematic is the way in which such a dislocation has led to the acceptance of her â€˜ mexicanness â€™ as mere decoration of the essentially feminist themes of her work , thereby defusing a substantial part of the art described by breton as a â€˜ ribbon round a bomb â€™ .
it is the ribbon that runs through the pages of vogue , the glossy surface of the images in direct opposition to a work such as kahlo 's the suicide of dorothy hale ( 1939 ) ( fig. 9 ) .
in this painting , a memorial to a woman 's tragic death is transformed into an indictment of the culture which destroyed her .
hale 's suicide became a poignant metaphor for the oppressive nature of the social values of new york and north america in general .
the story behind hale 's death was one with which kahlo obviously identified , and within which dress formed an important symbolic function .
before jumping from the window of her apartment , hale had dressed meticulously in her most flattering dress , the corsage of yellow roses a gift from a male admirer .
in kahlo 's painting , the figure falls from the fantasy world she has inhabited to the harsh bloodspattered reality of the street , literally coming down to earth .
hale 's eyes stare knowingly at the viewer , a human sacrifice to an alienated and consumerist culture .
the horizontality of her fallen body is juxtaposed to the vertical thrust of the apartment building .
she leaps from an architectural monument to a phallocentric world .
although destroyed , she has also escaped .
the painting , dedicated to hale 's mother , was commissioned by a mutual friend of kahlo and dorothy hale , the managing editor of vanity fair , clare boothe luce .
the painting was agreed to by luce in part to recompense for what she saw as her misjudgment of her dead friend .
having lent hale money to pay her rent she had been angered to discover her spending enormous sums on an haute-couture dress , and refused to turn up to what , in retrospect , became hale 's farewell party .
later it was revealed that the money had come from a different source .
a male friend had tried to dissuade hale from seeking a much needed job and had given her a thousand dollars to buy â€˜ the most beautiful dress in new york â€™ , telling her that what she needed was to find a rich husband .
on one level this work deals with a generalised â€˜ woman 's experience â€™ , yet the metaphorical power of dorothy hale 's dress derives from kahlo 's use of clothing in her own self-portraits .
dress not only covers and decorates the body but instils in the wearer its own characteristic strengths and weaknesses .
hale 's black velvet dress is cursed because it represents the values of the â€˜ gringolandia â€™ so hated by kahlo .
in those paintings where kahlo wears european dress she is passive , weak and unable to control her own destiny , but in the tehuana costume she is strong , powerful , hopeful .
unclothed , her body becomes yet more vulnerable , but as jean franco states :
the unclothed body is not a â€˜ self but a socialised body , a body that is opened by instruments , technologized , wounded , its organs displayed to the outside world .
the â€˜ inner â€™ frida is controlled by modern society far more than the clothed frida , who often marks her deviation from the norm by defiantly returning the gaze of the viewer .
kahlo 's naked body becomes not just the tortured self of her personal biography but a visual counterpart to the injured and defiled manifestations of mexico 's colonised past : la llorona â€˜ the weeping woman â€™ of popular myth and la chingada , the raped and abused mother described in paz 's the labyrinth of solitude .
descended from an aztec mother goddess , llorona is a long-suffering mother figure , symbolic in a wider sense of the trauma of the spanish invasion .
driven mad with grief by the loss of her child , she is thought to wander the streets weeping and crying out a ghostly memory of the pre-conquest past .
at its most simple , la chingada , as the mother of mestizo culture is â€˜ the mother forcibly opened , violated or deceived â€™ .
the female soil possessed and misused by the masculine force of the spanish invaders .
the indian mexico raped and abused by the conquistador yet bearing his bastard child .
the rhetoric of the tehuana opposes the nihilism of traditional feminisations of colonial trauma , and asserts the potential of a dignified cultural resistance .

phoenix art museum , arizona .
a major , though often ignored , work by kahlo demonstrates the cultural politics underlying her art .
my dress hangs there ( 1939 ) ( fig. 10 ) is one of the artist â€™ s most formally adventurous works , mixing photographic collage with paint to produce a critique of north american culture .
kahlo does not appear in the work , her tehuana costume hangs empty in the centre of the composition , suspended between a toilet bowl and a golfing trophy .
on one level my dress â€¦ is a coda to self-portrait on the borderline ( 1932 ) ( fig. 11 ) of the previous year .
this small painting on metal , in the style of a catholic votive image , shows the artist poised between the technological inhumanity of a capitalist north america and the archaic fertility of mexico .
interwoven with these images are subtler references to the metaphorical borderlines which separate latin american culture from that of europe and north america .
this is done by a series of juxtapositions ; the past versus the present ; female nature versus masculine technology ; growth versus exploitation ; and in its very material presence , the traditions of fine art versus the popular .
at the same time the ambivalence of her own , and modern mexico 's position is manifested in the figure of the artist .
the paper flag of her homeland is contrasted to the modernity of the cigarette held in her other hand .
the red and green of the aztec necklace links it compositionally with the indigenous plants to the â€˜ south â€™ of the painting , the pink colonial-style dress tonally blending with the skyscrapers to the â€˜ north â€™ .
my dress â€¦ again suggests a conflict , but the ambivalence is gone .
nature has been banished , technology and its concomitant values reign over a harshly masculine world .
three elements refer to the female presence , all of them dealing with an essential lack .
the empty dress , a peeling poster of mae west and in the far distance the statue of liberty .
fig. 10 .

leo eloesser .
although occasionally humorous , the work presents a bleak view of urban alienation .
the church , wall street , and industry are joined by a network of telephone lines , forming a remorsely inhuman environment .
beneath this man-made mechanism of oppression are the people , literally distanced from their surroundings by kahlo 's use of photo-collage .
in the forefront of this scene flutters the dress , incongruously vibrant despite its suggestion of loss .
dislocated from its political context , it hangs like a piã±ata above the teeming streets of the city ; decorative yet potentially explosive .
there is no place â€˜ there â€™ for the values the tehuana dress represents , its folds are given meaning by kahlo 's search for a cultural identity .
within the confines of the painting it becomes a silent emblem of protest , a reminder of political alternatives .
the physicality so characteristic of kahlo 's work is missing , no flesh , no blood , just the tawdriness of the peeling poster and the hollow reminder of lost liberty .
the inter-relationship of body and dress so self-consciously referred to in many of kahlo 's most polemical works ( fig. 12 ) has been strangely inverted by her current popularity .
her â€˜ mexicanness â€™ has become a stylistic gloss , decorative , colourful , pretty , even individualistic .
the colonised body which kahlo clothed in revolutionary idealism has lost its function as a symbol of nationhood becoming instead an icon of female suffering .
what is obscured by this process is that it was through clothing , in both art and life , that kahlo attempted to redress the wrongs of history .

jackboots beneath the serge television .
by hugh hebert
there was one point when the hair on the back of my head began to lift .
not at paul hill 's remembrance of beatings past , when he could hear the sound of steel-tipped boots running to take part in the fun , and once heard a principal medical officer , no less , telling colleagues : â€˜ do n't walk his face , do n't walk his face . â€™
not even the time he was dunked head first in a tub of dubious liquid , and brought up gasping for breath : â€˜ make him sing god save the queen ! â€™ they shouted .
brutality , as hill describes and felt it , was a bitter part of his prison life ; you just learnt to get down on the floor as fast as you could and cover up as best you could .
but it was gerry conlon 's account of being interrogated after the guildford bombings that made the scalp crawl .
we know your mother works at the royal victoria hospital , they told him , we know where your sister works , and there are sectarian killings down there .
â€˜ they told me they could arrange an â€˜ accident â€™ .
and i believed they were capable of murdering my mother , i honestly believe they would have murdered my mother â€” that 's why i signed the statement . â€™
the account he gave just after his release was that the threat had been that a british soldier might â€˜ accidentally â€™ shoot one of the women .
a few months ago even , this would have seemed improbable .
you might have assumed this was the police bluffing and bullying .
yet given what we have learned about links between the security services and the loyalist paramilitaries in northern ireland , and the deep suspicion about surrogate murders , you ca n't shrug off the shiver conlon 's words bring .
there were daunting moments in last night 's first tuesday ( yorkshire ) , but few of them matched that hint of a jackboot under the blue serge .
it 's right that the guildford four have told their stories now to grant mckee and ros franey and first tuesday , the programme and the producers who dug away , and did much to keep the case alive .
and they told it without on-screen questioning , though the programme is skilfully structured to give it a coherence it might have lacked .
carole richardson 's is the most haunting face .
you have to hope that its blankness will slowly dissolve and let life in .
just once a couple of tears rolled down .
it was when she described seeing film of the results of the bombing on television , and thinking : â€˜ they think i did that ! â€™
armstrong seems the least permanently damaged on the surface .
he pays tribute to his treatment at gartree prison , he apologises to the bomb victims ' families that they have had to keep reminding them of their loss : â€˜ but we had to fight for our freedom . â€™
hill expresses the way time has cheated them : his daughter was born while he was remanded in custody , and is now 14 : â€˜ she would change dramatically and i did n't feel a change in myself mentally .
i 'm still 20 in my head .
nothing 's happened to me .
i have n't lived . â€™
but again it was conlon , the slightly wild-eyed irish poet of the quartet , articulate , flamboyant â€” remember that extraordinary exit through the front door of the old bailey â€” who cut deep into the collective conscience .
he described being taken over the years to see his sick , and finally dying and almost certainly innocent father in another prison .
he was convicted with the maguires in the parallel case of a â€˜ bomb factory â€™ .
and he tells how none of the assembled guards and officials could look his father in the eye as he protested his innocence .
only the nurses could do that .
and at the end , conlon drew the one hopeful conclusion : â€˜ if this stops capital punishment ever coming back , the time i 've spent in prison will be well worth it .
if this stops another innocent person going to prison , it 'll be well worth it â€¦
â€˜ i 've had numerous prison governors say to me , yes , conlon , we know you 're innocent , but there 's nothing we can do about it .
we get a custody order , and that 's it .
what sort of system of justice is that ? â€™
it was n't the only programme last night to shine light into dirty corners .
inside the brotherhood ( granada ) , produced by claudia milne and martin short , dug into the most notorious area of masonic influence , local government .
in southend , where 3,000 of the 50,000 adult males are reckoned to be masons , it went into the case of what you might call preferential allocation of council property , and the battle of one councillor , christopher hudson , to break the grip of the men on the square : â€˜ we ca n't have a secret society operating within the framework of a democracy , â€™ he said .
â€˜ it 's a paradox , it 's a nonsense . â€™
though over the years , from southend to tyneside and the government 's own property services agency , there 's all too much evidence that this is exactly what we do have .

if a dwelling house is in such a state of disrepair as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance , the tenant may lay an information against his landlord alleging the existence of a statutory nuisance under the public health act 1936 .
the tenant is not obliged to ensure that the landlord is aware of the defects in the premises or to give the landlord an opportunity to remedy the defects before commencing legal proceedings .
although that is the position in law , the court emphasised that as a matter of commonm_sense a tenant should first complain to the landlord before exercising the right to prosecute .
the facts .
mrs bujok and her family occupied a house as council tenants .
in september 1988 mrs bujok laid an information against the council alleging the existence and continuance of a statutory nuisance under section 92(1) of the public health act 1936 .
it was alleged that the council , being the owners of the premises , were the persons by whose act , default or sufferance the nuisance arose .
prior to laying the information mrs bujok had not served an abatement notice upon the council or informed them of the alleged defects in the premises .
the justices held mrs bujok was not required to ensure that the council were aware of the defective state of the property prior to laying the information .
the council appealed by case stated .
the legislation .
section 92(1) of the 1936 act defines â€˜ statutory nuisances â€™ as â€˜ any premises in such a state as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance â€™ .
the decision .
mr justice hutchison said the 1936 act primarily envisages a system where the local authority has a power and a duty to try to secure that premises are not in a state which constitutes a statutory nuisance .
action is initiated by the service of an abatement notice requiring remedial work .
if the person in default fails to comply with an abatement notice the local authority is obliged to make a complaint to the magistrates .
if the complaint is proved , a nuisance order is made requiring the defendant to get the necessary work done .
effectively the sequence is that the person in default is told what is wrong and is required to put it right .
he is given an opportunity to do so , and if he does not , he is subject to sanctions by the court to compel him to do so .
the problem arises in connection with section 99 which adapts or applies the provisions to cases where an individual rather than the local authority wishes to make the complaint .
need he serve an abatement notice ?
the authorities plainly establish that he need not and can not do so .
does that mean he may lay an information and bring the matter before the magistrates without first putting the person alleged to be in default on notice of what is alleged ?
the council argued that a landlord , particularly one such as a local authority , can not realistically be expected to have a system of inspection of all its premises and in practice is entitled to depend upon notification by its tenants .
for mrs bujok it was argued that the 1936 act was designed to secure in the interests of the community at large that statutory nuisances did not exist .
it was submitted that an owner can not turn his back on his property because when he purchases and takes on the responsibility of letting , he knows the property will in the course of time deteriorate .
he must therefore satisfy himself on a regular basis that it does not constitute a statutory nuisance .
in warner v lambeth london borough council ( 1985 ) 15 hlr 45 , 50 , lord justice glidewell said a private person could lay an information alleging the failure to abate a statutory nuisance without first giving notice requiring abatement .
therefore in the present case the justices came to the correct conclusion .
his lordship reached that decision without enthusiasm because it seemed that as a matter of common sense , notice should be given in such circumstances before criminal proceedings were launched .
lord justice watkins said he agreed with reluctance .
it was surely repugnant to commonm_sense that in this area of legal activity a local authority should be prosecuted by one of its tenants without first being given the opportunity by that tenant to remedy the consequences of a neglect to repair the dwelling that the tenant occupied .
in law there was no doubt that mrs bujok was entitled to commence proceedings without giving notice of the state of the dwelling to the council .
but in every other conceivable way that action was entirely wrong .
endless trouble to many people in courts and council offices and much money could be saved by the giving of notice of disrepair .
if the council did not react to that notice , then would be the time for the tenant to exercise the right to prosecute .
parliament should give fresh thought to enacting a provision placing an obligation upon a council tenant to give notice to the council before being permitted to commence proceedings .

leinster face an uphill task .
by robert armstrong in dublin
the all blacks begin the irish leg of their 13-match tour at lansdowne road today against leinster , who have never beaten a major touring side .
leinster have named a team that looks strong on paper , including eight internationals , yet they recently lost to both munster and ulster in the inter-provincial championship .
such is the mood of pessimism here it is hard to find anyone who believes the all blacks , having won their seven matches in wales , will face any significant threat during the next fortnight .
ulster , the provincial champions , may well fancy their chances on november 21 , but leinster look certain to face an uphill struggle even though the tourists have rested 13 of the team that beat wales .
leinster will be hard pushed to keep the score within the respectable margins of defeat set by their predecessors .
in 1964 the all blacks defeated leinster 11-5 , they won 17-8 in 1972 and scraped home 8-3 in 1974 .
however , during the eighties irish provincial rugby has assumed a third world status in relation to new zealand 's .
leinster have been undermined by their failure to secure prestige fixtures since the mid-seventies .
when new zealand last toured ireland in 1978 leinster were ignored .
the same thing happened in 1984 when the province was denied a fixture against the wallabies .
such neglect has done nothing for their confidence .
even so , the all blacks , who include seven capped players , will give today 's opponents due respect .
as their coach , alex wyllie , remarked : â€˜ when we arrived in wales we were told cardiff were no damned good and look how well they played against us .
leinster are quite capable of doing the same . â€™
wyllie is confident his western samoan wing , va'aiga tuigamala , will play although he is still niggled by an ankle injury received against neath two weeks ago .
the test flanker alan whetton , whose hamstring injury kept him out against wales , will form a powerful back row with kevin schuler and the international no.8 , zinzan brooke .
the tourists will field four backs aged 21 or under .
for their part , leinster are boosted by the presence of four players already selected for ireland to play new zealand in dublin on november 18 .
they are brendan mullin , the lions centre , fergus aherne , the scrum-half , and the two new caps , nick popplewell at loose-head and brian smith , the fly-half .
no doubt smith , the oxford university australian , who won five caps for the wallabies , will feel a bit closer to home facing the all blacks twice in the next 11 days .
it will be fascinating to see how smith , a gifted all-round footballer , shapes up in his prospective international partnership with aherne .
equally intriguing will be the line-out performance of the young london irish lock , neil francis , who has been left out of the current ireland squad .
fortunately , leinster 's front five , which includes the experienced tight-head prop des fitzgerald , looks upm_to the task of scrummaging against the all blacks .
however , real problems may arise once leinster attempt to win the loose ball .
leinster will be led by their third captain in as many matches , the centre paul clinch .
leinster : f dunlea ; j sexton , p clinch ( capt ) , b mullin , p purcell ; b smith , f aherne ; n popplewell , n kearney , d fitzgerald , n francis , b rigney , p kenny , k leahy , a blair .
all blacks : m ridge ; j timu , b mccahill , w little , v tuigamala ; f botica , b deans ; g purvis , w gatland , s mcdowell , i jones , g whetton ( capt ) , a whetton , k schuler , z brooke .
figures of fun open space ..
i write in response to judith raymont ( november 16 ) who wrote of the cartoon men â€” a user 's guide , â€˜ it is either insulting to men and should not be endorsed by publication , or it is witty and amusing , in which case we , as women , have no right to complain about equivalent portrayals of female stereotypes . â€™
it does not matter if the cartoon is insulting to men .
the number of such cartoons is so small that , set against the insults to women broadcast by every newsagent and television channel , only a loony masculist would object to them .
before raymont works towards â€˜ ways of showing respect , understanding and affection to members of the opposite sex â€™ , she should realise that the opposite sex 's obsession with â€˜ members â€™ is a problem of enormous gravity .
there is nothing respectful , understanding or affectionate about page three .
w j gaskill ( male ) east kilbride
iwould agree that male and female stereotypes portrayed in cartoons are equally abhorrent , were it not for the fact that , whilst one pokes fun at a powerful group in society ( men ) , the other perpetuates the oppression of a powerless group ( women ) .
in an ideal world , there would be no need for either , but for now i would rather see the frustration expressed in these light-hearted terms than in the sort of man-hating bitterness that has given feminism such a bad name .
natalie ford brighton
men â€” a user 's guide is stupid , negative and insulting .
am i , as a man , supposed to think that , if my body is hairy , it is â€˜ thick and bestial â€™ ?
or that my mind , which i consider intelligent and creative , is occupied only with sex , violence and car engines ?
is this funny ?
what kind of hypocrisy allows you to ( presumably ) condemn a similarly degrading portrayal of women , whilst making your page a forum for this cartoon ?

soccer : littlewoods cup , fourth round : oldham athletic 3 , arsenal 1 double by ritchie ends 66-year wait .
by stephen bierley
oldham athletic , who had never beaten a first division side since they dropped into the second division in 1923 , made up for 66 years of not altogether patient waiting with a pulsating victory over the league champions arsenal at boundary park last night .
the pennines fairly shook .
no supporter of the latics dared dream it , but suddenly the improbable was a throbbing , joyous reality .
two goals from the irrepressible andy ritchie , his 13th and 14th this season , and a third by the 20-year-old midfield player nick henry , and arsenal were sunk with only the trace of a last-minute goal by quinn .
despite many and varied flurries of activity in the first 40 minutes , arsenal seemed reasonably secure if not inspired .
they held their line and competed hard in midfield , damping down oldham 's initial verve and preparing themselves for more of the same in the second half .
then oldham struck .
winterburn almost put the ball into his own net from milligan 's cross , o'leary recovering an awkward situation .
almost immediately smith had an excellent chance for arsenal but stumbled .
oldham took up the attack again and barlow , who had a fine match at left-back , totally containing rocastle , floated in a deep cross beyond winterburn .
the predatory ritchie chested the ball down and hammered a volley past lukic .
arsenal had no choice but to attack as soon as the second half began .
a neat step-over by rocastle sent thomas hurtling in on goal but rhodes moved sharply off his line to smother the shot .
from the resulting corner rhodes made another fine save , hurtling to his right to deflect away dixon 's rising shot .
finally , with arsenal pressing hard , he clawed away quinn 's careful header from thomas 's drag-back .
quinn held his head in disbelief .
worse , far worse was to follow .
bunn , who scored six goals in the previous round against scarborough , this time turned into the provider , putting milligan clear and free .
he was hauled back on the edge of the area by o'leary , a â€˜ professional â€™ foul for which the arsenal central defender was booked .
holden 's 64th-minute free-kick clattered the wall and the ball fell to henry , who drilled a low shot from more than 30 yards inside lukic 's right-hand post .
in another 10 minutes any remaining oldham doubts were dispelled .
ritchie passed to irwin and then ran on to head the cross past lukic .
arsenal were stitched and stuffed , with no question of a fluke .
not for the first time this season their defence had been found wanting and oldham exploited the weaknesses to the full , owing a special debt to the inspiration and tireless running of henry and milligan .
george graham was not amused .
he called his team 's performance â€˜ unacceptable â€™ .
but he also said : â€˜ let's not take any credit away from oldham .
they were tremendous , and outplayed us in the first half .
the plastic pitch is no excuse .
we trained on an artificial pitch for two days this week and we should have done a lot better . â€™
joe royle , the oldham manager , was full of praise both for graham and his own team .
â€˜ george was brilliant , â€™ he said .
â€˜ he could have blamed this and that but he said we deserved it .
the manager 's attitude shows why they are champions .
he took it on the chin .
â€˜ one or two people will be ready to put this down to plastic but our goals were nothing to do with plastic .
this was a great performanc .
we rattled them from the first minute and did n't give them any breathing space .
we were helter-skelter for 90 minutes and we scored three great goals .
in the past we have had cup walks , not runs . â€™

prototyping is crucial to systems development , argues ian richards tailored to fit .
in systems development nothing is more fundamental than assessing user requirements .
if you do n't know what the system is required to do ; you do n't know anything .
but many system developers are unable to assess requirements properly .
they seem to think that you can ask a businessman what his requirements are and get an answer that amounts to a draft system specification .
a doctor does n't ask his patient what treatment to prescribe .
the patient can explain only what the problem is .
it is the doctor that provides the remedy .
if you ask a user what sort of system he wants you will be met with a blank look .
a user may have a deep knowledge of business problems , but knowing little about computers , has no idea how they should be tackled .
yet , analysts are heard asking time and again , â€˜ tell me what you want .
we 've gone awaym_from the days of systems imposed by the data processing department , this is going to be a system for the users . â€™
but of course the users do n't know what they want , so they end up getting another duff system .
an effective analyst provides the same service to the business as the doctor provides to the patient .
he finds out what the needs of the business are , and prescribes the cure .
the user tells the analyst what the problems are , and the analyst decides , at least in broad terms , what the user requires .
but the analyst has one great advantage over the doctor .
once the user becomes familiar with the proposed system , helpful comments come thick and fast .
â€˜ oh , this will be of great help in ordering raw materials , but sometimes we get part deliveries , could we have an extra facility to deal with those ?
and sometimes non-standard discount is given , a pig to deal with on the old system , but if you could add one extra input box on that screen there â€¦
and what about orders not delivered on time ?
if we could list those we 'd have advance warning of shortage problems on the assembly lines two months before they occur .
now that would be a great leap forward . â€™
unfortunately you can not reach this stage until you have developed a prototype system .
and you ca n't develop a prototype system because the users have n't got a clue what they want .
most of them are probably muttering , â€˜ i 'm too busy to get involved in this sort of thing .
what 's wrong with the old system anyway ? â€™
the only way to develop a prototype is for the analyst to get inside the head of the user and , thinking like a user , decide what sort of system is required .
of course , the initial system will not be perfect .
the analyst can not hope to understand the business as well in a few weeks as the user does after many years .
but once the user sees the system , channels of communication will open .
instead of persuading the user to specify requirements , the analyst will be driven by the user to meet key needs .
good system development goes through two distinct phases .
initially the analyst does all the work , leading the user towards a system he thinks is right for the business .
but once the user sees the potential of the system , a change in attitude takes place .
the process becomes demand driven by the user .
the analyst is then forced on the defensive , explaining why new features can not be included because they are technically difficult or prohibitively expensive .
traditionally , systems were validated by users agreeing functional specifications .
in theory , validation meant that the user had read the specification , imagined how the system would work in practice , and agreed the design .
it was only when using a â€˜ test â€™ version of the system ( available just before the planned implementation date ) that difficulties would come to light , and a host of change requests be issued .
the advent of fourth generation languages ( 4gls ) has made system development much easier .
with a 4gl an initial prototype can be put together quickly .
this means feedback is obtained early in the development process , and the system can grow around the user 's requirements .
crucial to the development process is the relationship built up between the analyst and the user .
the best systems arise when both have a deep understanding of each other 's jobs .
many developers use business analysts to ensure that the development team maintain a proper focus on business requirements .
but this can be counter-productive , as it cuts off communication between the systems analyst and the user .
too much specialisation is bad for systems development ; it feeds the temptation to get engrossed in technical difficulties and forget about the underlying business needs .
if you should stroll into a pub and meet an analyst and a user talking about work , and you can not tell one from the other , they have probably developed a successful system together .

tiphook confident .
container group tiphook yesterday said it was still confident of winning its joint â£643million bid for sea containers even though the battle has swung towards james sherwood 's ferries-to-trailers combine .
the offer from the anglo-swedish consortium formed by tiphook and stena ab is the subject of an appeal in the bermudan courts which is aimed at overturning an earlier ruling allowing seaco to proceed with its â€˜ poison pill â€™ defence .
tiphook , which yesterday unveiled a 124 per cent increase in half year profits to â£10million , hopes the court will block seaco 's purchases of its own shares .
alternatively , it may be able to muster enough support from seaco shareholders to halt the current disposal of assets by mr sherwood for its bid with stena to be fully considered .
the cost of the bid to tiphook is put at â£2million , which it says will have only a minor impact on full year results .
increased demand for its road , rail and sea container fleets during the first half helped boost the latest figures .
this flowed through to earnings per share , up a half at 19.6p and shareholders receive a 25 per cent increase in the interim dividend to 2.7p .
the shares rose 9p to 443p .
salvesen boost .
christian salvesen , the food process and distribution , generator hire and brick making group , raised pre-tax profits by almost 21 per cent to â£32.6million in the six months to september .
aggreko generator hire , salvesen 's world market leader which provides power for customers from pop concerts to the oil industry , contributed strongly to a 37 per cent growth in trading profits in the industrial services division .
oil slicks in alaska and elsewhere helped vikoma , the group 's environmental cleaning equipment manufacturer , which specialises in separating oil from water , and although salvesen brick , is suffering in the second half from a 30 to 40 per cent cut in demand as housebuilding nosedives , the first half was prosperous and full year trading profit should be on a level with 1988 , says finance director brian fidler .
almost a third of group profits are earned overseas , interest and tax charges are down on last year and gearing stands at 13 per cent .
capital spending of â£43 million should reach a total of â£87 million for the full year .
the shares rose 10p to 170p .
avon treads warily .
shares in avon rubber have fallen sharply this year as a result of the weak demand for winter tyres and rights issue call to finance the move into us motor components .
the sale of most of the lossmaking tyre distribution business to sumitomo , now also a minority shareholder in the only british-controlled tyremaker 's plant , gives the board confidence in some improvement this year , despite a poor immediate outlook for the motor producers .
pre-tax profit fell â£4.1million to â£12.2 million in the year to september 30 , in line with the severely-reduced expectations after the cadillac rubber acquisition and rights issue in july .
turnover was held at â£228.6million , an rise of about â£2million , by the earlier contribution from tyre distribution and the us replacement .
the final dividend goes up to 11.5p , making 16.5p , against 14p for the year .
earnings crashed by a third to 41p .
there was an extraordinary gain of â£13.4 million , covering the motorway tyres disposal and more rationalisation costs .
in short â€¦
whessoe saw pre-tax profit rise to â£4.78 million , from â£3.55 million , on sales of â£58 million down from â£100 million .
earnings were level at 17.5p a share .
dividends total 5p , up a penny , with a 3.75p final .
btp 's enlarged specialist chemicals activities boosted turnover to â£60.1million , from â£44.8million , in the september half and profit rose to â£9.6 million from â£5.6 million , including an exceptional â£3.1 million , from the rizzi engineering sale in italy .
earnings without such gains were 1.9p higher at 6.8p a share .
the interim dividend is 2.75p , a rise of 10 per cent .
norcros , the property , building materials and printing group , saw profits crash from â£29million to â£18.3million .
however , the city had been expecting bad figures and the shares rose 15p to 239p .
hardanger , the retail property developer , posted pre-tax profits up â£1.3million to â£8.37million .
the final dividend is 26.5p , making a total of 37.5p , against 30p .
crystalate , the electronics product group , experienced a â€˜ serious disappointment â€™ in the second half and hence profits fell from â£5.6million to â£2.9million in the year to september .
the markets .
kingfisher 's â£461million bid for dixon 's led to a resurgence of speculative activity yesterday .
dixons ' shares jumped to 153p in early trading but ended the day at 141p , a 22p rise .
other recently depressed stores , and companies with businesses similar to dixons , rose in sympathy .
gus a were particularly prominent at 1118p , up 28p ahead of today 's interim figure .
properties continued to shine as british land produced a complicated scheme to release the value of its property portfolio .
british land closed at 405p , a net gain of 48p .
hammerson shot up 45p to 855p in sympathy .

edoardo amaldi .
ragazzi of distinction : .
in december , 1943 , the men working feverishly to create the first american atomic bomb sent a team of â€˜ spooks â€™ to naples .
one of their main assignments was to contact edoardo amaldi , a physicist thought to be in hiding near rome .
six months later , the day before rome 's liberation by the allies , amaldi was found .
he was interviewed by moe berg , then one of the most famous baseball players in america .
berg was also an agent of the office of strategic services , which was later to give birth to the cia .
his job was to convince amaldi to pack his bags because there was a ship waiting at naples to take him to the united states .
amaldi 's presence there had been sought by two other italian colleagues , also physicists .
his mentor , enrico fermi , later to be called â€˜ the father of the bomb â€™ , and emilio segre ( who died in california earlier this year ) .
amaldi dodged the american invitation , perhaps because ( with rome liberated ) fermi 's mantle in physics had fallen on his young shoulders and there were younger minds to teach .
he wore that mantle well at rome university until his retirement in 1978 .
but amaldi never really retired nor grew old .
he kept regular hours in the university 's physics building , spoke at scientific meetings this year in moscow and washington .
as president of the accademia nazionale dei lincei he had delivered the welcoming address on tuesday to a symposium of scientists .
he then ordered a car to call for him the next morning for a similar occasion and was felled by a stroke while waiting for the lift .
amaldi grew up in a small town in lombardy , and took his doctorate in physics from rome at the remarkably early age of 21 .
in 1929 , he became one of the ragazzi di via panisperna â€” the street where fermi 's â€˜ kids â€™ carried out their own experiments under the master in their own under-financed lab .
emilio segre was one kid , and bruno pontecorvo , later to defect from britain to the soviet union , another .
it is interesting to note that the â€˜ pope â€™ â€” as the kids called fermi â€” â€˜ because he 's always right â€™ , was only seven years older than amaldi .
amaldi astounded his group in october 1934 with his discovery that by slowing down , rather than accelerating , neutrons , he could provoke intense nuclear reactions .
he held a chair in physics from 1937 until his retirement publishing more than 150 papers on atomic and nuclear physics .
he was awarded honorary degrees by algiers , glasgow and oxford .
he became a founder , and active executive , of the european centre for nuclear research in geneva .
i had the pleasure of two long talks last year with professor amaldi about his knowledge of what the german physicists were doing with their atoms during the war years .
apart for his incongruously white hair , amaldi seemed to have the mental lucidity and expected energy of a man half his age .
his modesty , considering his world-wide fame in his field , was endearing .
i knew almost nothing about physics but we shared some jokes about the rome telephone system .
in 1949 , amaldi wrote to the italian prime minister asking for permission to produce and sell sealing wax for letters , â€˜ so that we may raise needed funds for our physics lab â€™ .
the reply came from an under-secretary who said that the present funding was considered adequate and the commercial undertaking would be ill-advised .
it was signed by giulio andreotti , the present prime minister .
george armstrong edoardo amaldi , born carpaneto piacentino september 5 , 1908 ; died rome , december 5 , 1989 .
midwife at the birth of a state .
the intifada is a people 's unarmed revolution against occupation .
its two main slogans , repeated countless times in the directives issued by the underground leadership , are freedom and independence .
it has employed a dual strategy to achieve these two objectives .
first , a comprehensive civil disobedience campaign was begun by which people severed , or minimised , all the contact points by which they were bound to the israeli occupation authority .
this campaign included resignations of palestinian officials from public posts , the boycott of israeli goods and products , and the refusal to pay taxes and fines .
partial and full strikes , demonstrations , sit-ins , conventions â€¦ all these have in fact only constituted the outer layer of an inner mechanism of civilian rebellion .
the second , and complementary , part of the intifada strategy concentrated on the construction of an indigenous national authority .
as israel 's authority was being lifted , the population began creating an alternative authority of their own .
popular committees were established in villages , refugee camps , suburbs , streets , in fact in every community .
some headway was made in expanding self-sufficiency , whether through utilising more land for agriculture , developing home economies , or encouraging local manufacturers and products .
villages and refugee camps were thus being developed into â€˜ liberated â€™ or â€˜ independent â€™ areas , if not militarily , then at least psychologically , politically and infrastructurally .
bloody clashes would occur whenever armoured units raided these villages , storming through makeshift defensive road blocks and responding to rocks being thrown with live bullets and tear gas ; but no sooner would these army units be gone than authority would revert to the village residents .
palestinian flags would be raised on minarets and church spires , road blocks would again be erected , and life in all its aspects would once again be run by the local leadership .
the structure of the developing national authority has been both diffuse enough to prevent it from being destroyed by any one single sweep of arrests ( there have been more than 50,000 arrests since the intifada 's outbreak ) , and coherent enough to allow for the existence of a unified resistance strategy .
while the entire network of popular committees , local institutions and the general public constitute the field commanders in the battle of civilian disobedience and of constructing a political infrastructure , a rotating unified national command acts in the role of field-general , issuing a bi-monthly directive outlining policy and determining specific resistance programmes .
a high level of mobility in the structure allows for continuous interchange of roles and ideas , and retains for the unified national command the closeness to grass roots that is required to make it truly reflect people 's wishes and sentiments .
this expanded network of popular committees and institutions making up the unified leadership is infused by tens of thousands of activists who belong to , or identify with , the different factions of the plo .
in effect , therefore , the plo exists at all levels of organisation within the occupied territories .
thus the palestinian national movement both inside and outside the occupied territories is an organic whole .
the pattern of the intifada has been cyclical .
thrusts of resistance ( mass demonstrations , resignations , tax rebellions , etc ) would come in crests .
the pattern is determined by a wide variety of factors , including what the israeli army does .
but the relation is complex , not uni-directional .
harsh measures â€” putting an entire community under an absolute curfew for a continuous lengthy period of time , demolishing homes , uprooting olive or citrus trees , physical intimidation and terror tactics employed by raiding army units , shooting , killing , cutting off water or electricity supplies and telephone links to villages or towns , mass arrests , intimidatory interrogation techniques â€” can either create a temporary lull or activate an eruption .
the army never knows which it will be .
it is as if it is walking through a minefield .
the wave-like pattern of the intifada , its pains and sufferings , are all reminiscent of the process of birth .
the metaphor is apt , as palestinians regard themselves as engaging in a process of giving birth to their independent palestinian state .
through their revolution , the masses are both mother and midwife to the birth of this state .
the intifada is the midwife of freedom .
through it , palestinians are struggling on a daily basis to shake off israel 's authority and to construct their own .
the struggle reflects a revolution in mass consciousness , by which people have come to realise that ideas and aspirations must be embodied in manifest acts if reality is to be changed .
thus , wherever one looks , one finds people engaged in the construction of the blocks that will make up the palestinian state .
it is a conscious effort .
the masses are being engaged in the craft of state-masonry .
in this process of state building , many stages have been covered .
the declaration of independence issued by the palestine national council ( pnc ) on november 15 last year constitutes a major landmark along this road .
its significance lies in its double message : that the aim of the palestinian struggle is the establishment of palestinian independence , and that this independence is regarded as being not at israel 's expense .
this has been a constant theme of intifada policy : that we wish to build ( palestine ) , not to destroy ( israel ) ; that we wish to achieve freedom ( for our people ) , not to deprive others ( israelis ) of it ; that we wish to protect and save lives ( ours ) , not to endanger the lives of others ( israelis ) .
in one of several intifada leaflets written in hebrew and addressed to the israeli soldiers on duty in the occupied territories , the message was repeated : soldier , go home .
return to your family and children .
be with them in peace so that we may remain with our family and children in peace .
we do not wish to harm you , or your state .
we wish to be unharmed , in our own state .
how can the process of state building be developed ?
if the pnc declaration of independence constituted a major landmark in this process , the time has come to embark on another major step , that of declaring the setting up of a state or government structure .
an escalation of the intifada in this direction would serve two purposes at once .
first , it would consolidate the structures of the developing national authority which is competing to replace the occupation authority .
second , it would consolidate the image and essence of the intifada as a constructive , not a destructive , force .
naturally , to embark on such a step is not necessarily to succeed immediately in realising it .
rather , it is a challenge .
it will be a further challenge to israel 's occupation , conceived in the image of earlier challenges of the intifada .
but it will also be a challenge to us , palestinians , summoning us to work more energetically towards the idea 's fulfilment .
it would be a natural extension of the intifada 's dual strategy towards disengagement from israel , and the corresponding process of state building .
it would further naturalise and legitimise the evolving skeletal form of palestinian independence .
it would provide the multitudinous popular committees and activities with a more advanced form of organisation and structure .
it would enable better planning and performance .
it would maximise civilian tactics of resistance and defuse the natural potential for violence , containing and eventually eliminating the marginal but intrusive phenomenon of collaborator activation by israeli security authorities and collaborator execution by local palestinians .
it would create a further fact that would put israel on the spot .
israel 's reaction , however hostile , could only further our cause .
arresting or deporting the tens of thousands of palestinian professionals who would be employed in perfectly apolitical , harmless and humanitarian jobs can only further isolate the israeli government .
half-way measures can only imply half-way success .
a modus vivendi would also imply success .
in general , our policy should be to proceed with building our state block by block , without waiting to be given a gift of it through negotiations .
we should regard negotiations rather as the means by which we could establish formal agreements between our state and israel .
such agreements can range from the issue of borders to the issue of free wave-lengths for our future television and radio networks .
in the meantime , we have the capacity to bring coherence and organisation to a whole range of activities , further consolidating the institutional linkage between the people in the occupied state and the plo leadership .
entire departments can be set up , in health , foreign affairs , agriculture , trade , finance , education , justice , religion , information and social welfare .
a pyramid administrative structure , establishing links from popular committees in villages right up to the executive committee of the plo ( in its capacity as a cabinet ) , can be established .
during the intifada the people have been engaged in building the side walls .
a government would provide the roof which would bring these walls together .
it would add another necessary touch in the process of creating a palestinian home .

â€˜ the palestinian national movement inside and outside the occupied territories is an organic whole â€™ photograph : david sillitoe
the boy and the dog skirted round opposite sides of the puddle , the boy , a light , tall fourteen-year-old , labouring in wellington boots too large for him , and the dog , a three-year-old labrador bitch , picking her way reluctantly , with frequent pauses , as if her paws hurt .
the boy , unlike the dog , knew that the mud did not go on for ever ; beyond the bridge , the disused railway embankment along which they were walking became built up , so that water ran off it .
he pulled the dog close to him to let a mixed string of horses and ponies go past , waving shyly to the lead rider , a pretty , capable girl an unbridgeable two years older than him .
he watched her as she went past at a walk , the black labrador and he both gazing wistfully , their breath steaming in the cold february morning .
he waited till the horses were well away and looked round the wide , flat landscape carefully before unclipping the lead .
â€˜ way you go , patty , â€™ he said softly , and the dog was off , hurling herself along the embankment , all paws and flying ears , after a rabbit who had been sitting in a patch of sun but disappeared with contemptuous ease as she came close .
the boy had been told unequivocally not to let her off the lead â€” the riding-school only used the land by grace of its owner and it was a shooting estate â€” but he hated keeping the dog straining at the lead and knew that she would always come to his call .
he stood for a moment laughing at her as she cast furiously for the vanished rabbit , and walked on , to catch her up , along the raised embankment .
the trees had grown up beside it in the twenty-five years since the railway had closed , and the boy stopped every now and then to watch small birds hopping around the top branches .
he particularly liked this stretch ; nothing but the odd tractor and the horses ever came down this embankment , and the birds were unworried by his presence .
after half a mile he decided to turn off the embankment and walk up the side of the next field and along the path at the top of it , following the horses whom he could still see in the distance .
he called patty to him .
she did n't come , which was surprising ; she was a docile creature and particularly devoted to him because he always took her for a walk when he was at the stables .
he could hear her barking and looked down over the steep side of the embankment to the bottom of the trees .
he called her again and again , but she would not stop barking at something he could not see .
probably a squirrel , he decided , and slithered down the side of the embankment to join her , scolding as he went .
straightening up beside the dog , he looked where she was looking , and blinked .
he saw a leg , uncomfortably wedged between sapling trees , swollen grotesquely , and gazed at it , stupidly , wondering if it was plastic .
as his eyes focused he realized he was looking at a hideously swollen human body , and just then , as the light breeze shifted , he caught the stomach-turning odour of decay .
he was a sensible and capable boy , an eldest child , so he moved closer , trying not to breathe , and stood steadfastly looking until he was confident of what he had seen : a body , must be a girl because it was wearing a skirt , lying face down , head towards the bottom of the embankment as if she had dived off the top .
he clipped the lead on to the dog with cold hands which would hardly function , and let her pull him up the slope as fast as he could make his legs move .
he stopped on the embankment , shaking with cold and shock , to note the spot , then fled along the tractor paths , the dog running with him , to the stables where the ten o'clock children 's ride was in its closing stages .
â€˜ miss williams ! â€™
â€˜ jamie , i 'm teaching . â€™
the thin , capable woman who was taking the riding-class looked at him in amazement as he leaned panting on the gate to the ring , the dog whining beside him .
â€˜ i 'm sorry .
please , i 've found something , i must tell you .
she had known him since he was a very small five-year-old , perched like a mosquito on one of the placid beginners ' ponies , so she told the class to carry on walking their ponies while she came to him .
â€˜ there 's someone dead .
below the railway embankment . â€™
â€˜ are you sure ? â€™
the boy looked at her and uncontrollable tears suddenly filled his eyes .
he was very nearly as tall as her , but she put an arm under his shoulders and supported him to the untidy room which served as the stable office , calling to one of the stable girls to take over the class .
â€˜ patty found her .
she 's just lying there , but she is dead . â€™
he scrubbed at his face with the handkerchief she offered and gulped for air .
â€˜ i 'll ring the police . â€™
she did so , casting an experienced eye over him .
â€˜ sit down here , jamie , and i 'll make some tea .
mummy will come back in a few minutes , wo n't she , for susie ? â€™
â€˜ not mummy .
aunt margaret is coming at ten . â€™
the boy thought longingly of his mother , but managed to help miss williams describe the location of the body to a startled local station sergeant and to drink a cup of sweet milky tea without being sick .
by the time his aunt arrived jamie was so far recovered as to be able to refuse to go home and to point out , severely , that he would be needed , either to assist the police or to be lead rider in the eleven-thirty class , or possibly both .
he watched his aunt and miss williams wordlessly consult each other , but knew his aunt would do as she was told ; successful solicitor though she was , she was ten years younger than miss williams and , as she complained , totally intimidated by her as she had not been by anyone since her late headmistress .
he was unsurprised to find her packed off firmly to take his sister home , leaving him as a person of major importance in what he instantly assumed to be a real murder .
miss williams took him to meet the police land rover at the stable gate , a bone-thin , wiry woman in her late fifties , her expression sufficiently forbidding to prevent the parents , edging cars through the gate to collect children from the ten o'clock ride , from asking any questions .
jamie , through a renewed queasiness , just observed that the police driver was instantly reduced to half his age by miss williams 's greeting .
â€˜ he was one of my boys , â€™ she said in explanation to the cid sergeant who was leading the party as they bumped over the rough road , through the thick mud and on to the dry embankment .
â€˜ like jamie here . â€™
â€˜ did you recognize the person you found , young man ? â€™ the sergeant asked , carefully .
â€˜ no . â€™
tears started into jamie 's eyes .
â€˜ she was all swollen . â€™
the sergeant 's eyes widened , and he slid out of the land rover and stood back to let jamie out .
â€˜ very competent boy .
almost a professional singer , handles himself very well . â€™
miss williams 's natural pitch , well suited to reaching across a hunting-field , was discreetly reduced .
the cid sergeant thanked her gravely and went to stand beside jamie who was peering down the embankment , looking pinched .
â€˜ we 'll go down together , lad . â€™
â€˜ there is n't room .
i 'll lead . â€™
he took a deep breath and headed down , the sergeant , two constables and miss williams in his wake .
soon they all stood side by side , one of the younger policemen coughing involuntarily .
â€˜ oh dear , oh dear , â€™ miss williams said on an indrawn breath .
â€˜ sorry .
come along , jamie , let's get you back . â€™
she took out a handkerchief and mopped her eyes .
the police driver shot jamie a look of enquiry which he missed , occupied as he was with guiding miss williams back up the hill .
he had seen her weep before but only for a sick horse , and he was awe-struck .
â€˜ jamie , did you let patty off the lead ? â€™
the boy blushed to his ears and owned to it .
â€˜ you must not do it , jamie , we 'll be in trouble with colonel james , i 've told all you boys a thousand times . â€™
â€˜ he 'll perhaps not do it again , â€™ the sergeant murmured , and received the look that miss williams habitually bent on a child who was riding carelessly .
â€˜ how long had she been there ? â€™
jamie asked , anxiously .
â€˜ a few days , â€™ the sergeant said , grimly .
â€˜ how many ? â€™
â€˜ doctor 'll tell us . â€™
he considered the boy thoughtfully , and decided to take him back quickly .
these teenagers were in his experience a lot less tough than they looked .
â€˜ any idea who it could be ? â€™ he asked miss williams casually .
â€˜ no .
but only a local would know to put a body there .
if jamie had n't let the dog off the lead she could have been there much longer . â€™
the sergeant nodded , deciding it could do no harm to concede a point he had already taken .
â€˜ no one could tell who she was , surely ? â€™
miss williams said quietly to him , sounding shaky .
â€˜ she did n't even look human . â€™
the sergeant confirmed that that happened with bodies after a few days .
â€˜ we 'll identify her , though , â€™ he said , reassuringly .
â€˜ somebody will likely have reported her missing . â€™
he stopped , abruptly , as he remembered a conversation earlier that week , and lit a cigarette , thinking furiously .
this could be the girl whom the yard were looking for , and he had better do everything very quickly indeed , including finding his chief , who would then want to find his chief constable and notify scotland yard .
presumably it would be the yard who investigated this one , rather than the regional crime squad .
he chewed his thumbnail as he walked , out of long experience keeping in mind the highest priorities : ensure body not moved and ensure next of kin notified before the press got the story .
he posted the detective constable he had with him back down the path to join his colleague , armed with instructions to repel all attempts by anyone , however senior or armed with whatever authority , to go anywhere near the body unless he , sergeant black , personally accompanied them .
then he climbed into the land rover beside his two passengers and drove off fast , with the aim of abandoning jamie to the custody of his aunt as quickly as possible .
he could see with half an eye that the kid 's aunt was going to be one of the confident , bossy , well-connected women with whom that part of cambridgeshire was substantially over-provided .
john mcleish was in his office , saturday or no saturday , telling himself he needed to catch up on the paperwork .
the phone rang and he picked it up , frowning .
one of the pleasures of saturday working was that the phone did not ring all the time .
the voice at the other end was plainly over-excited and it took him a minute to disentangle what he was being told .
â€˜ oh congratulations , charlie .
sorry , what did you say it was again ? â€™
â€˜ a little girl .
actually a very big girl as these things go , nine pounds .
it 's fantastic , john , there she is , a new person , lying on her face , sound asleep .
i 've just left them and i 'm going back . â€™
mcleish repressed the malicious thought that this event might put francesca 's nose just a little bit out of joint .
she had been utterly secure in her position as the only girl in the wilson family and now there was another one .
â€˜ i 've got another bit of good news .
frannie 's going to be able to bring tristram home pretty soon , apparently . â€™
mcleish expressed qualified enthusiasm and charlie assured him he felt exactly the same about his younger brother .
â€˜ the difficulty is that perry does everything that bit better than tristram .
not that this is any excuse , john , i do know . â€™
he paused , reminding mcleish irresistibly of a labrador wondering how best to approach an acquaintance .
â€˜ i wanted to say , you see , that i know you thought frannie should n't have gone , and that it 's ruined your holiday plans , and , on behalf of us all , i 'm sorry .
i know the little boys lean on her too much and i would have gone if i could . â€™
he coughed , embarrassed and a little pompous , very much conscious of his new status as a father , while mcleish remembered that he was a scant four years older than the delinquent tristram .
â€˜ anyway she should be back soon , â€™ charlie concluded .
mcleish thanked him gravely , feeling , as he often did with the wilsons , that he was being enveloped in a large feather eiderdown , and , made restless by the call , went down the corridor to where he knew catherine crane was also in , getting her office in order .
he stopped at the door and smiled at her .
wearing jeans and a blue shirt , she was tugging at a filing cabinet which was too large for her to embrace and which was threatening to over-balance on her .
she looked about sixteen and beautiful .
she let go of the cabinet , coughing in the dust of ages that appeared to be lurking behind it , and smiled back at him as the february sun shone through the small window behind her , throwing into sharp relief the patches on the wall where her predecessor had hung posters , and the ingrained dirt on the flaking paintwork round the mean , narrow , metal window .
â€˜ where do you want that put ? â€™
mcleish advanced on the cabinet and shifted it authoritatively , ignoring the clip on the ankle dealt him by an unsecured bottom drawer apparently full of bricks .
â€˜ i should have unloaded it first , â€™ catherine crane said , apologetically , â€˜ but i just could n't move in any direction with it where it was . â€™
â€˜ i 'm here , just tell me if you want anything else shifted . â€™
he hesitated .
â€˜ i 'm going to do another hour , then have some lunch , if you want to come ? â€™
he was aware that he was not managing to sound exactly like a senior officer making a recent arrival feel at home , but decided not to add any further riders to his invitation .
â€˜ that would be very nice .
are we going to the canteen ? â€™
â€˜ not if i can help it .
what about the pub ?
â€˜ if i 'm allowed to buy my own . â€™
mcleish considered .
â€˜ that 's fine on the food â€” i 'll buy the drinks , i 'm too old to get used to women buying my drinks . â€™
she laughed at him and said gravely that she would be happy to indulge him , and he went away , grinning .
peter yeo was also in his office , having told his wife he was lunching with a client .
it was , he felt , just too difficult to be at home at all , with claudia in a permanently bitchy mood and both his teenage children taking their cue from her and behaving intolerably .
he wandered restlessly about , and decided that the lie might as well become the truth .
without angela morgan , at least two major clients were in danger of not getting the assiduous service they were paying for , and it would be well worth trying to see if one of them , whom he knew to be a fellow refugee from family life at the weekends , could be found .
he was in luck , and fixed to meet andy barton at brazzo 's where yeo davis had a table permanently booked .
he had to admit that this particular client hardly added to the general decorative smartness of the place .
andy barton , founder and chief executive of barton textiles , was almost as broad as he was long , virtually neckless , with incongruously long brown hair curling over his collar .
his enormous hands dwarfed the elegant menu which he was studying in apparent disbelief , and peter yeo noticed again , as barton without rising extended one massive paw , that though the fingers were an ordinary length it was the width of the palms that made the hands so large .
â€˜ i never see how they get the sales per square foot in these places , â€™ barton observed , without further greeting .
â€˜ i mean , they 're not open twelve hours like my shops , and they are n't using the space . â€™
his small bright blue eyes swept disparagingly over the minimalized black and white flooring , stainless steel chairs and black wooden bar .
â€˜ they make a huge margin on a smaller turnover , andy , out of punters like us . â€™
peter yeo was amused by , and respectful of , a man with an obsession .
â€˜ angela not working today ? â€™
barton worked a sixteen-hour day , which began with careful , detailed consideration of the trading figures and key ratios for every one of his forty-three major shops and the output of both factories , and continued , usually by helicopter , with a detailed aerial survey of a particular area as the quick way of identifying new sites , interspersed with unheralded descents on the manager of any shop he took a fancy to visit .
peter yeo , who had known this particular juggernaut since he had his first small factory and two stores and dirt under his fingernails from shifting packing-cases personally , was not fazed by the question .
â€˜ angela 's taking a few days off â€” she has n't been well , â€™ he said , easily .
â€˜ i know she 's been working very hard for you .
i 'm up to speed with huerter , of course , but is your planning application in leicester all right ? â€™
barton assured him warmly that angela had done a great job and he was now confident of getting planning permission on the vast site he had wanted .
peter yeo , who knew him in this over-candid , over-emphatic mood , decided to prod gently .
â€˜ angela said the council wanted it for housing ? â€™
â€˜ yeah , some of them did .
silly buggers , it 's jobs they want there first .
plenty of housing if those stupid farts at the council got round to repairing it and stopped their tenants tearing apart what they have got .
my mum brought up five of us in a flat far worse than what these immigrants complain about . â€™
peter yeo , who had personally persuaded barton of the presentational disadvantage of using words like â€˜ darkies â€™ , â€˜ niggers â€™ or â€˜ wogs â€™ , decided that â€˜ immigrants â€™ even though used in the manner of one invoking a curse , was as good as he was going to get with this particular client .
â€˜ she 's doing a good job on sorting this huerter thing , too .
bloody ridiculous them blokes at the dti pushing assistance for huerter .
i voted for this government because they said they were n't going to go in for that sort of rubbish .
no one ever gave me anything and my business works .
still , angie can fix the treasury on this one , given her boyfriend , ca n't she ?
that 's the reason i wanted you on this . â€™
peter yeo winced inwardly , but he was not going to tell andy barton that angela was missing , or express any of his reservations about how much influence angela could bring to bear .
he smoothly changed the subject to the looks of the blond model , three tables away , and barton agreed he would n't mind a bit of that ; on the thin side , mind you , but tasty .
the rest of lunch passed in similar diversion , interspersed with details of last week 's turnover which were never far from barton 's mind , whatever other distractions offered .
mrs huntley was having lunch with her daughter .
she ate placidly , acknowledging to herself with her customary good sense that at the moment , as at any time since her brother william had died , she and penelope were getting no pleasure at all from each other 's company .
penelope was looking particularly discontented and disaffected , picking at her food .
her red suit was smart , but too bright a colour for her pale english pink and white skin , her brown hair could have done with a wash and her nails were ragged and bitten .
she was frowning , deep lines appearing between her eyebrows , mouth drawn down at the edges so that instead of a classically good-looking slim english rose in her late twenties , she looked faded , years older than her real age , and shrewish .
mrs huntley sighed ; her brother whom she had loved , but knew to be self-indulgent to a fault , had done his niece real harm by leaving so much of his money away from the girl who had confidently believed herself to be his favourite thing on earth .
penelope , however , it had to be acknowledged , had made no attempt to rise above the blow she had been dealt by finding a dazzling girl of her own age favoured over herself in her uncle 's will .
at least , mrs huntley thought hopefully , she had stopped wondering , unbecomingly and stridently , how her uncle could have been fooled by angela morgan .
it was grizel huntley 's own view that her brother had not been fooled at all but had been charmed and diverted by a dashing girl thirty years his junior , and had seen no reason at all why she should not have a share of his considerable estate when that left a very decent down-setting for his niece as well .
indeed , she had respected angela morgan for the straightforwardness with which she had tackled the issue when they had met at the lawyer 's office .
â€˜ i 'm sorry you 're disappointed , â€™ she had said to penelope , â€˜ but after all there 's a lot of money , quite enough for both of us . â€™
so there was , grizel huntley acknowledged , and it would be a great deal better if penny could manage to think a bit more positively .
â€˜ if she has vanished , i 'm going to see that solicitor about whether i can get her presumed dead . â€™
penny , sounding childishly , sullenly determined , broke into her mother 's thoughts .
grizel huntley looked across at her , shocked .
â€˜ i would wait a little if i were you . â€™
penelope glared at her , turning an ungraceful scarlet , but mrs huntley held her ground .
â€˜ you are being silly about this , penny .
you are letting this disappointment â€” and that 's all it is , you 're still a very well-off young woman â€” get in the way of everything . â€™
penelope choked on her pudding and started to cry , angry , uncontrollable tears .
grizel huntley reached out to comfort her but she forced back her chair and fled , clutching her handbag and napkin , leaving her mother with the ruins of lunch .
fifty miles north , sarah morgan had just finished serving a lunch that no one had done more than pick at .
her husband francis had made a slightly better showing than her daughter jennifer , who was looking particularly ragged .
mother and daughter were very like each other , tall , dark , slim , pleasant-looking women with mid-brown curly hair and slightly snub noses .
francis morgan , by contrast , was dark , almost black-haired , sallow-skinned , with bright brown eyes .
of medium height and packed with energy , even distressed as he was , he was bursting round the kitchen , hair still damp at the back from his swim .
â€˜ let's go to the flicks .
no point at all sitting round looking at each other .
come on jennifer â€” or are you going out with michael ? â€™
â€˜ he 's gone back to australia , dad .
last week . â€™
jennifer sounded defeated , and he looked at her sideways with familiar love and exasperation .
she just did n't seem to be able to hang on to men , he thought impatiently , not like his angie , wherever she was .
â€˜ giles rang up , â€™ his daughter volunteered , and he was uncomfortably reminded by something in her voice that giles hawick was one of the men jennifer had n't been able to hang on to â€” or not once he had seen angela .
â€˜ how was he ? â€™ his wife sarah asked , rather too quickly .
â€˜ well , very worried .
he said the police were talking to everyone angie had seen in the two weeks before she â€¦ well â€¦ vanished , and so far had come up with nothing .
i mean no one noticed anything unusual about her and she seemed to be full of plans for the wedding . â€™
â€˜ well , i told them that , â€™ francis morgan said irritably and his wife and daughter caught each other 's eye in silent agreement that he had n't told them that angela was refusing point-black to be married from home and was insisting on the full london set-out , reception at the house of commons , replying unanswerably when he had objected on grounds of expense that she could well afford to pay for it herself .
a row of epic proportions had ensued , which he and angela had evidently enjoyed but which had left sarah and jennifer sick with distress .
â€˜ i do n't want to go out , frank .
someone might ring . â€™
sarah morgan was sounding diffident but resolute , and as morgan opened his mouth to protest in exasperation the doorbell rang .
both women looked at him in joint appeal and he marched to the door , pulling it open with unnecessary force .
he stood , door in hand , checked by something in the way his visitors , a man and a woman , were standing .
the man , a stocky , greying fifty-year-old in a navy raincoat over a suit , his hair cut short , was attended by a uniformed policewoman , hair smartly set under the cap , her eyes watchful in the wide , flat , placid face , and both of them were standing square and stolid .
francis morgan stood and stared at them , and even before the man stepped forward steadily , hand extended , mouth opening to speak , he understood who they were and what they had come to tell him .
mark sanders returned from istanbul feeling exhausted , depressed and ill .
the blinding headaches he had been experiencing in recent weeks were taking their toll , and he looked grey and drawn when he arrived home .
lately , georgina had been worried by the general deterioration in his appearance .
but now she was visibly shocked by the drained and haggard-looking face which kissed her .
she wanted to say , â€˜ you look awful , darling , â€™ but decided against it .
â€˜ what kind of a trip have you had ? â€™ she asked instead .
â€˜ oh , not too bad , â€™ he replied wearily .
she took his suitcase and placed it at the bottom of the stairs .
â€˜ come into the kitchen , and we will have a cup of tea .
i 'm_ve so much news to tell you .
all sorts of things seem to have happened while you have been away this time . â€™
mark smiled thinly and kissed her affectionately on the cheek .
â€˜ tell me about it , â€™ he replied .
â€˜ i could do with a good laugh . â€™
â€˜ why darling ?
what 's the matter ?
trouble at t'mill ? â€™
mark slipped an arm around her slim waist as they walked from the hall into the kitchen .
â€˜ perhaps it 's old montezuma 's revenge , â€™ he replied .
â€˜ must be getting too old for this globe-trotting lark , or else my mis-spent youth is catching up on me .
i 'm rapidly coming to the conclusion that this is a young man 's game . â€™
â€˜ nonsense , mark .
you 're still a young man â€¦ well , youngish. â€™ she said , trying to tease him out of his apparent lethargy and depression .
â€˜ let's have that cup of tea and you 'll feel better . â€™
â€˜ ah , fill the cup , what boots it to repeat , how time is slipping underneath our feet , â€™ he quoted with a sigh .
â€˜ oh darling .
what a sad sack we are today .
is that how you feel ?
shall i accompany you on the violin ?
now let me tell you all the news . â€™
she poured the tea .
â€˜ christopher has been promoted after only one year .
the chairman of the company told him he was most impressed with the contribution he 's made to the business , and that he could go right to the top if he keeps it up .
i knew you 'd be delighted to hear that . â€™
she sipped her tea .
â€˜ next â€¦
i 've found a super husband for harriet .
champion of the breed at crufts last year .
lives in the next village , believe it or not .
absolutely magnificent dog . â€™
â€˜ lucky harriet , â€™ said mark .
â€˜ what else ?
ah yes ; a secretary at the ministry of industry wants you to ring him .
seems they want you to address the european commission on european industrial development .
in dublin , i think she said .
something about the factors which influence multi-nat location decisions .
anyway , you 'll know what it means when you see it .
i 've written it all down .
oh and yes â€¦ a chap from conservative central office rang up to say they 'd like to know if you would be prepared to stand for the european parliament .
he sounded somewhat to the right of genghis khan .
i said i did n't think so , as you were rather busy , but i 'd pass the message on .
hope i did the right thing .
i said you never knew where you were from one week to the next .
he said that would do nicely .
just like the american express advertisement .
perfect credentials apparently , for european parliamentarians .
â€˜ now what next ?
the chicheley-smythes have bought an absolutely super villa in sardinia and say we could rent it if we 'd like to .
i 've seen the photographs .
gorgeous location overlooking a quiet bay .
it sleeps ten with a permanent staff of three .
only a thousand pounds a week , yacht included .
i 'd love that for two or three weeks , would n't you ? â€™
â€˜ we would n't want to stint ourselves , â€™ mark said facetiously , â€˜ four or five , i should think â€¦ . â€™
â€˜ and we could take the family , â€™ she said .
â€˜ we have n't had a family holiday for years .
i 'd like that .
but we can talk about that later .
and i 've decided to take up riding again .
do n't ask me why .
just got the urge , that 's all . â€™
she gave him a beautiful smile , which lit her lovely face .
â€˜ well , how 's that for starters ? â€™ she asked .
he had heard that expression before .
â€˜ is there more ? ,
â€˜ now let me see .
ah , yes â€¦
andrew 's coming home for the weekend so i thought it would be nice to have a drinks party .
i 've invited the bunkers , if that 's all right .
i like clem and gwen and the girls would be nicer company for andrew . â€™
â€˜ fine , â€™ agreed mark without much enthusiasm .
â€˜ if clem can make it , that is .
i heard about this latest merseyside strike in istanbul .
could finish off the uk vehicle division , â€™ he said forlornly , â€˜ and don peters , â€™ he added , shaking his head .
some of the stupid bastards wo n't be satisfied until we no longer make a single vehicle in the uk .
then i suppose they 'll say it 's all management 's fault , and people will believe them .
and who the hell is management ? â€™ he demanded , his voice rising .
â€˜ people like me , who 've worked their guts out to expand the business while the militant bastards have been working their guts out to destroy it . â€™
georgina was nodding agreement .
she patted his wrist .
â€˜ i 'm quite sure you 're right , dear .
but we were n't talking about the motor industry and the never-ending management-union saga .
we were talking about andrew coming home for the weekend and having the bunkers round for drinks .
and i do wish you would n't swear like that when you talk about business .
you never used to swear , you know .
at least , you did n't when you were with me .
but you do now , darling , and i do wish you would n't .
you are becoming so hard and bitter and it 's not really like you . â€™
mark sighed .
â€˜ i 'm sorry .
it 's just â€¦ . â€™
â€˜ it 's just that there really is trouble at t'mill , â€™ she said quietly .
â€˜ that 's it , is n't it ?
you were n't going to tell me .
you were just going to worry about it alone .
you let me go rabitting on â€¦ .
he hugged her ; kissed her cheek .
â€˜ i 'm not sure yet that there really is something to worry about . â€™
â€˜ but you think there is . â€™
he nodded .
â€˜ i have a horrible feeling that um is about to reorganise world-wide planning operations and , if that happens , it 's curtains for the european organisation and for me . â€™
â€˜ curtains ? â€™ she said .
â€˜ what exactly would that mean ? â€™
â€˜ early retirement . â€™
â€˜ mark , you 're not serious ! ,
â€˜ i think it could be on the cards .
they could transfer me to detroit , or somewhere .
i do n't know , but i do n't like the signs . â€™
â€˜ oh , mark , â€™ she said .
â€˜ they would n't do that to you .
they just could n't .
not after all you 've done for the corporation .
they could n't be that unfair and ruthless . â€™
his expression was wry .
â€˜ my dear , they 'll do whatever they feel is necessary to do .
sentiment , loyalty , service and track record , none of these things will come into it . â€™
georgina took him in her arms and kissed him on the lips .
â€˜ it 's all so ridiculous that we 're not going to even think about it any more , â€™ she said firmly , hiding her fears .
â€˜ now come into the garden , â€™ she added , smiling .
â€˜ i want to show you the clematis .
it 's a mass of colour . â€™
lying in bed that evening , they talked a lot about their life together .
they recalled their first days .
the county ball .
the paul jones and the emotional somersaults when the music stopped and they came face to face for the very first time .
the wedding .
the birth of their first son , adam , and then christopher and andrew .
the children growing up with all the laughter and tears .
schooldays and the void they both felt when the boys went off to boarding school , followed by the joy unconfined when they came home at the end of term .
mark 's promotions and progress up the company ladder .
new and changing homes .
friends lost and friends gained .
family achievements and disappointments .
notwithstanding current problems which they discussed lightly , it had all been wonderful .
they fell asleep in the early hours of the morning , holding hands .
the next day mark arrived back at um 's european headquarters in london and received an early call from muldoon .
he went down the airless corridor to his boss 's office , said hello to the secretary , and walked into the large oak-panelled room which was as big as the lobby of many a sizeable hotel .
muldoon rose immediately from his enormous black leather chair to greet him , coming from behind the vast desk with hand outstretched .
â€˜ hello mark .
have a good trip ? â€™
he took the englishman by the arm and ushered him toward the easy chairs arranged around a long rectangular coffee table .
instinctively , mark felt uneasy .
why the hand on the arm and the over-friendly approach ?
muldoon never emerged from behind his desk to greet colleagues .
only visitors and vips got that special reception .
muldoon poured the coffee .
â€˜ how did the planning meeting go ? â€™
mark asked him .
â€˜ what was nate 's reaction ?
did he and the committee go along with my proposals ? â€™ he added .
â€˜ it went fine , â€™ muldoon said .
he seemed somewhat uneasy .
â€˜ klepner did a good job . â€™
â€˜ how did he handle the questions ? â€™
mark asked .
â€˜ he does n't have the inside knowledge to deal with questions . â€™
â€˜ oh , ok really .
i handled some and so did mueller .
but klepner did ok .
he did n't let the side down . â€™
mark nodded .
â€˜ what was mueller doing answering questions .
he was there to ask them .
he does n't know the inside track any more than klepner . â€™
â€˜ maybe not , but he soon will , â€™ muldoon replied quietly .
â€˜ and what does that mean ? â€™
muldoon seemed to be taking a long time over his coffee .
he evaded mark 's eyes .
â€˜ he 's goin' to head-up world planning operations from detroit . â€™
â€˜ he 's already co-ordinating the regional plans to provide a world picture .
so what 's changed ? â€™
deep down he knew .
â€˜ he 's not going to just co-ordinate and consolidate any longer , â€™ muldoon said , with increasing nervousness .
â€˜ he 's gon na plan , direct and control worldwide planning operations from detroit , including the regional planning functions . â€™
mark 's expression was one of faked incredulity .
his gut feelings had been right .
â€˜ you 've got to be joking ! â€™ he scoffed .
â€˜ i know that 's what mueller 's always wanted , but nate and the executive committee would never fall for that bloody empire-building game !
the regions are far too big and complex to be handled from detroit and even if they were foolish enough to believe that they could do it more effectively â€” which they ca n't â€” they would be crazy to try . â€™
â€˜ i know , mark , i know , â€™ muldoon said .
â€˜ but that 's what they 're gon na do . â€™
â€˜ it will boomerang , â€™ the englishman said heatedly .
â€˜ overseas governments and local nationals just wo n't stand for it , particularly when they get to know what 's going on .
that 's one corporate plan that ca n't win , not in the long term .
â€˜ i know , mark .
but they think they can run everything from detroit and that 's the way the organisation is going to be restructured .
they are working on it right now .
we will know the details in a few weeks â€™ time .
couple of months at the latest . â€™
mark said quietly :
â€˜ and how does that affect the european organisation ?
â€˜ the organisation will be wound up .
i 'm taking early retirement . â€™
â€˜ and me ? â€™
muldoon shrugged .
â€˜ not certain yet .
but my guess is early retirement too , unless you 're prepared to go back to divisional work .
local md perhaps ? â€™
the englishman snorted .
â€˜ you know i ca n't go back .
who the hell can ?
in any case , you know as well as i do that the mds are always american . â€™
â€˜ well , there wo n't be any european job functions , that 's for sure , â€™ muldoon said .
â€˜ there 'll be a direct link between detroit and the line managers in each country , with detroit calling the shots . â€™
â€˜ do n't they realise they 're playing with political dynamite ?
mark demanded .
â€˜ mueller wo n't give a damn about the effect of a corporate plan on europe and on individual countries .
if he wants to import vehicles or components from taiwan or singapore or hong kong into europe , he 'll go ahead and do it , regardless of the economic consequences for the european countries concerned .
the only thing you can be sure of is that us interest will always come first .
oh , and there 's one more thing you can be sure of , â€™ he added sourly .
â€˜ they wo n't plan to supply the us market from imports .
you can bet your bottom dollar on that !
jesus wept ! â€™ he continued , hackles rising .
â€˜ mueller will have the power to make or break whole areas of europe .
he 's the last guy in the world who should be given such power .
the bloody man 's power drunk already . â€™
he was angry and bitter .
â€˜ i know , â€™ muldoon agreed sadly .
â€˜ then what are you and clancy doing about it ? â€™
â€˜ look , mark , â€™ muldoon said forlornly â€˜ what 's the point ?
the wheels have already been set in motion .
we 're not gon na change anyone 's mind .
you know that . â€™
his tone was abject .
â€˜ sorry you 're takin' it so bad , â€™ he added miserably .
â€˜ how else should i take it ? â€™
mark demanded .
â€˜ it 's my life which is about to go down the plughole .
i 'm not an american on a brief overseas assignment .
i 've spent my entire working life in the european components â€™ business .
i 've grown up in it .
it 's in my blood .
i 've built plants and managed them .
designed products and marketed and sold them .
when i was an apprentice there were two component plants in europe , and now there are seventeen , and i 've had a hand in establishing the last twelve .
what the hell do you expect me to say ?
oh , is that what they are proposing to do ?
well bully for mueller and the corporation ?
i 'll go and collect my hat and coat ! â€™
â€˜ i know how you feel , mark , â€™ muldoon said sadly .
â€˜ do you , pat ?
do you ?
you 're sixty-one and have been looking forward to retirement .
i 'm fifty and have a long way to go .
i do n't think you can see things the way i see them .
â€˜ well , perhaps not , â€™ muldoon agreed .
â€˜ but i can understand how you feel . â€™
the englishman nodded and poured himself more coffee .
â€˜ so what 's going to happen to the european plan ? â€™ he asked .
â€˜ mueller will drive it from detroit , with one or two amendments agreed at the epc meeting , â€™ muldoon told him .
â€˜ what amendments ? â€™
â€˜ no further plant investment in the uk . â€™
â€˜ i suppose mueller saw to that , â€™ mark said sarcastically .
â€˜ he really hates our guts !
god help the british plants under the new regime ! â€™
muldoon shook his head .
â€˜ no , it was n't that .
it was the strike at merseyside .
that was the last straw as far as nate was concerned .
up until that news hit the committee , don had won the day with his uk vehicle division proposals .
but as soon as nate heard about the latest strike , that was it .
end of story .
he instructed mueller to phase-out vehicle manufacture in the uk . â€™
mark nodded .
â€˜ how did don take it ?
he was beginning to win through . â€™
â€˜ he 's very upset .
naturally .
it 's the first time in his career he has n't come out on top .
mueller is taking over the plan , and don is being transferred back to the states .
public relations job or something similar .
just think of it , a man of his talent and ability stooging around the media . â€™
â€˜ so when 's he going back to the states ? â€™
mark said .
â€˜ it wo n't be announced for a week or so , but he 's already been told .
he 'll fly out inside the month . â€™
â€˜ and what do you and i do now ?
mark enquired .
â€˜ start emptying the files ? â€™
muldoon made a face .
â€˜ afraid so .
klepner will take over the files and ship them back to the states .
he 'll be mueller 's european components â€™ planning manager in detroit . â€™
â€˜ klepner ? â€™
mark uttered in mock astonishment .
â€˜ the man knows nothing about europe .
he 's a novice .
a bloody charlatan ! â€™
â€˜ i know it sounds crazy , mark , â€™ muldoon said .
â€˜ but there it is .
we have no choice in the matter .
i was instructed to tell you , and i have .
new york and detroit will come up with an attractive separation package , you can be sure of that .
they 've already told me you 'll get the maximum terms permitted under british law .
the corporation wants to do the right thing by you . â€™
the two men rose from the table together .
â€˜ sure .
we have no choice in the matter , â€™ said the englishman .
â€˜ there has to be losers as well as winners , , said the american .
â€˜ i guess we 're both losers , mark . â€™
the englishman returned to his own palatial office and sat with his head in hands .
another of his blinding headaches had developed and he felt a tight sensation in his chest , which made breathing very painful and difficult .
his secretary entered the room .
can i get you a coffee , mr sanders ?
you do n't look at all well .
shall i get the doctor ? â€™
he looked up and smiled .
â€˜ no thank you millie .
i 'm all right .
just a headache .
be ok in a minute .
would love a cup of coffee though .
â€˜ are you sure i should n't get a doctor ? â€™ she asked .
â€˜ no thank you .
i 'll be ok .
it 's only a headache . â€™
millie had her reasons for being concerned .
the petticoat mafia at the top of the organisation always knew what was going on , often before the top executives themselves .
millie and the secretaries of pat muldoon and clancy mcgillicuddy were all close friends .
they had got together over the weekend to discuss the implications of the confidential letter the two americans had received from randy mueller on behalf of nate cocello .
major changes were afoot which affected their respective bosses .
by the time mark reached home that evening , the pains in his head were excruciating .
he decided against telling georgina about his meeting with muldoon .
he would wait for the right moment .
this was n't it .
homicide
this chapter deals with the approach of the criminal law to behaviour which causes or risks causing death .
murder , manslaughter , and several other offences are discussed , and one recurrent issue here is whether english law responds proportionately to the different degrees of culpability manifested in cases where death is caused .
7.1 death and finality
for practical purposes , the culpable causing of another person 's death may fairly be regarded as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar .
there is an argument that treason is a more serious offence , since it strikes at the very foundations of the state and its social organizations , but treason is so rare that it is surely permissible to treat homicide as the most serious form of crime .
the reason for this is not difficult to find : the harm caused by many other crimes is remediable to a degree , whereas the harm caused by homicide is absolutely irremediable .
even in crimes of violence which leave some permanent physical disfigurement or psychological effects , the victim retains his or her life and , therefore , the possibility of further pleasures and achievements , whereas death is final .
this finality makes it proper to regard death as the most serious harm that may be inflicted on another , and to regard a person who chooses to inflict that harm as the most culpable of offenders , in the absence of some excuse or justification .
although many deaths arise from natural causes , and many others from illnesses and diseases , each year sees a large number of deaths caused by â€˜ accidents â€™ , and also a number caused by acts or omissions which amount to some form of homicide in english law .
for 1987 the statistics show that there were some 20,000 accidental deaths , of which some 7,000 occurred in the home , 6,000 at work , and 5,000 on the roads .
by comparison , the number of deaths recorded as criminal homicide was 600 , which includes all the murders and manslaughters .
this figure is relatively small when compared with many american cities , but that is no cause for satisfaction .
there are still awkward questions to be confronted .
for example , are we satisfied that the 600 deaths recorded as homicide are in fact more culpable than all , or even most , of the deaths recorded as accidents ?
in other words , does english criminal law pick out the most heinous forms of killing as murders and manslaughters , or are the boundaries frozen by tradition ?
another question is whether the criminal law ought not to be wider in its application to activities which carry some risk of causing death than in other spheres .
thus , even if it would be excessive to sweep large numbers of the deaths now recorded as â€˜ accidents â€™ into the law of homicide , there may be sufficient justification for creating or enforcing offences designed to ensure safe conditions of work , safe goods , safe buildings , and so on .
it was argued in chapter 2 that the criminal law ought to spread its net wider where the potential harm is greater .
it will be seen that english law does this up to a point , and in the process seems to accept social-defence arguments as reasons for departing from several of the principles set out in chapter 3 .
7.2 requirements of criminal homicide
english law distinguishes between the offences of murder and manslaughter , as we shall see , but the two crimes do have certain common elements .
it must be proved that the defendant 's act or omission caused the death of the victim within a year and a day .
( the requirements of causation in the criminal law are discussed elsewhere . )
the â€˜ year and a day â€™ rule is a legacy of times when medical science was so rudimentary that , if there was a substantial lapse of time between injury and death , it was unsafe to pronounce on whether the defendant 's conduct or some other event caused the death .
nowadays the problem is quite the reverse : medical science is generally able to determine whether d's conduct caused the death , and innovations such as life-support machines mean that life can be prolonged for months and years in some instances .
in one recent case the victim of a stabbing died two and a half years after the incident , having been kept on a life-support machine for almost the entire time .
in principle , it seems unjust that a homicide conviction should not be possible in such a case , if all the other elements can be established and only the â€˜ year and a day â€™ rule stands in the way .
but the rule was confirmed by the criminal law revision committee in 1980 , on the ground that a defendant should not be left in peril of a homicide conviction indefinitely .
surely prosecutorial discretion should be enough to prevent unfair convictions years after the event .
the rule itself is out of accord with modern medical conditions and should be abolished .
defining murder : the inclusionary question
( a ) the procedural context
if causing death is to be regarded as the most serious harm that can be inflicted , it would seem to follow that the most blameworthy form of homicide should result in the highest sentences imposed by the courts .
indeed , many systems of criminal law impose a mandatory sentence for murder ( or whatever the highest form of homicide is called in that system ) .
in some jurisdictions this is a mandatory sentence of death .
in others , such as those in the united kingdom , it is the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment .
why should this penalty be mandatory , and not at the discretion of the court as in other offences ?
one argument in favour of the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment is that it amounts to a symbolic indication of the unique heinousness of murder .
it places the offender under the state 's control , as it were , for the remainder of his or her life .
this is often linked with a supposed denunciatory effect â€” the idea that the mandatory life sentence denounces murder as emphatically as possible â€” and with a supposed general deterrent effect , in declaring that there is no mitigation of sentence available for this crime .
it might also be argued that the mandatory life sentence makes a substantial contribution to public safety .
none of these arguments is notably strong , let alone conclusive .
the mandatory penalty does indeed serve to mark out murder from other crimes , but whether the definition of murder is sufficiently refined to capture the worst killings , and only the worst killings , remains to be discussed below .
whether the life sentence is regarded as a sufficient denunciation in society depends on the public 's perception of what life imprisonment means : if it is widely believed that it results in an average of nine years ' imprisonment , the effect will be somewhat blunted .
the same applies to the general deterrent argument : its effectiveness depends on whether the penalty for murder affects the calculations of potential killers at all , and , if it does , whether life imprisonment is seen as significantly more or less severe than the alternative of a long , fixed-term sentence .
as for public protection , this depends on executive decisions with regard to release ; it fails to take into account whether it is necessary for public protection to keep â€˜ lifers â€™ in for so long .
this brings the discussion to a crucial point : what does the sentence of life imprisonment mean in practice , and what would be the alternative ?
what it means is that the time of release from prison is determined by the home secretary , on the advice of the parole board and the lord chief justice , rather than by the judge at the trial .
in procedural terms , therefore , the life sentence involves a transfer of function : normally it is the judge who determines the sentence ( or at least its upper limit , since earlier release on parole may be possible ) , whereas a life sentence entrusts that function to the executive , who must first ascertain the opinions of the lord chief justice and the trial judge .
the home office is not bound by those opinions , and appears to depart from them frequently .
in 1983 the home secretary imposed restrictions on the release of persons serving life for murders of police- and prison-officers , terrorist killings , murder during robbery , and the sadistic or sexual murder of young children , fixing a minimum of twenty years ' imprisonment for these offenders .
whatever the justifications for introducing this policy , it serves to underline the fact that sentencing in murder cases is enacted without each case being considered individually , after hearing representations from the offender 's counsel , and without a sentence announced in court and subject to appeal .
at present , the executive takes decisions to release some murderers after only a few years and to keep others in prison for extremely long periods .
should those decisions not be taken by the courts , in the same way as other sentencing decisions ?
the answer sometimes given is that murderers should be treated differently because they are particularly dangerous : anyone who chooses to kill once can choose to kill again .
but this argument will seem less persuasive when we have discussed cases of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility : where a murder is reduced to manslaughter , the judge has a wide sentencing discretion and may , according to the facts of the case , select a determinate prison sentence , a hospital order , or life imprisonment .
those who kill and are convicted of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility are no less dangerous than those convicted of murder , and yet the judge has sentencing discretion in one case and not in the other .
considerations of this kind have led the house of lords select committee on murder and life imprisonment to recommend the abolition of the mandatory sentence for murder .
in its place would be a sentencing discretion , which judges would use , in many cases , to mark the relative heinousness of the murder by a determinate prison sentence .
in cases where life imprisonment was thought to be the appropriate sentence , the trial judge would still specify â€” in open court â€” the number of years to be spent in prison , taking the gravity of the offence into account , and release would be determined by a judicial tribunal .
such a reform would bring improvements in natural justice without loss of public protection .
( b ) degrees of homicide
english criminal law has two degrees of homicide , murder and manslaughter .
many american jurisdictions have three degrees of murder â€” first-degree murder , requiring premeditation , and second- and third-degree murder , covering lesser shades of culpability .
in england there has been a proposal that we should do away with all these distinctions , leaving a single offence of criminal homicide .
that proposal , if implemented , would shift almost all the decision-making in homicide cases from the trial to the sentencing stage : the only issue of any consequence in most cases would be the sentence to be imposed , and all the distinctions now drawn at the stage of criminal liability would be reflected in the sentence alone .
the jury would have no role in most homicide cases , since a plea of guilty would be the norm .
contrast this with the position in jurisdictions where there are three or more degrees of homicide : pleas of guilty to first- and second-degree murders would be less frequent , since there would be the possibility of argument in court ( if no bargain was struck beforehand between prosecution and defence ) , and the defence might succeed in persuading the jury to reduce the degree of the killing .
moreover , the borderlines between the various degrees would raise questions of law , which would provide much opportunity for legal argument and for appeals .
the result would be that killings were classified and labelled in a more refined way , but at the cost of lengthy trials and mounting legal-aid bills .
that cost is not difficult to justify where capital punishment is the penalty for first-degree murder .
where there is no capital punishment , however , the question of how many degrees of homicide it is desirable to have calls for careful weighing of the principle of fair labelling ( see chapter 3.3 ( l ) ) against the cost and time arguments mobilised by the policy of efficient administration ( see chapter 3.3 ( m ) ) .
the structure of the english law of homicide is rather strange .
although there are two offences , murder and manslaughter , the latter includes two distinct varieties : â€˜ voluntary â€™ manslaughter ( killings which would be murder but for the existence of defined extenuating circumstances ) ; and â€˜ involuntary â€™ manslaughter ( killings for which there is no need to prove any awareness of the risk of death being caused , but for which there is thought to be sufficient fault to justify criminal liability ) .
the arguments therefore tend to focus on three borderline questions : what is the minimum fault required for conviction of murder ?
what conditions are needed to reduce murder to manslaughter ?
and what is the minimum fault required for a conviction of manslaughter .
( c ) requirements for murder
in english criminal law there are now two alternative fault requirements for murder : an intent to kill , or an intent to cause grievous bodily harm .
what do these requirements mean ?
do they extend the definition of murder too far , or are they too narrow .
intent to kill may be regarded as the most obvious and indisputable form of fault element for murder , but to some extent that depends on the meaning of â€˜ intent â€™ .
this has been the subject of a number of house of lords decisions , and yet the definition is still not clear and settled .
probably the most accurate statement would be that a person intends to kill if it is his or her purpose to kill by the act or omission charged , or if he or she foresees that death is practically certain to follow from that act or omission .
in this way , both purpose and foresight of practical certainty are regarded as part of the definition of intent , although there are other statements suggesting that foresight of practical or â€˜ virtual â€™ certainty is merely evidence from which intent may be inferred .
how would this test be applied ?
in many cases the word â€˜ intent â€™ is used without elaboration , but there are some for which a full explanation of the meaning of intention is necessary .
a fairly typical set of facts is provided by nedrick ( 1986 ) , where d had a grudge against a woman and had threatened to â€˜ burn her out â€™ .
one night he went to her house , poured paraffin through the letter-box and on to the front door , and set it alight .
one of the woman 's children died in the ensuing fire .
when asked why he did it , d replied : â€˜ just to wake her up and frighten her . â€™
a defence of this kind , a claim that the purpose was only to frighten and not to cause harm , requires the full definition to be put to the jury .
the question is : granted that d's purpose was to frighten , did he nonetheless realize that it was practically certain that his act would cause death or grievous bodily harm to someone ?
the jury should answer this by drawing inferences from the evidence in the case and from the surrounding circumstances .
what about the alternative element in the definition , an intent to cause grievous bodily harm ?
this has considerable practical importance , since this is all that the prosecution has to prove in order to obtain a verdict of guilty of murder .
it must be shown that the defendant intended ( which , again , includes both purpose and awareness of practical certainty ) to cause really serious injury to someone .
the house of lords confirmed this rule in cunningham ( 1981 ) : d struck his victim on the head a number of times with a chair , causing injuries from which the victim died a week later .
d maintained throughout that he had not intended to kill , but there was evidence from which the jury could infer â€” and did infer â€” that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm .
the house of lords upheld d 's conviction for murder : an intent to cause really serious injury is sufficient for murder , without any proof that the defendant intended , or even contemplated , the possibility that death would result .
does the â€˜ grievous bodily harm â€™ rule extend the definition of murder too far ?
if the point of distinguishing murder from manslaughter is to mark out the most heinous group of killings for the extra stigma of a murder conviction , it can be argued that the â€˜ grievous bodily harm â€™ rule draws the line too low .
in terms of principle , the rule requires justification because it departs from the principle of correspondence ( see chapter 5.2(a) ) , namely that the fault element in a crime should relate to the consequences prohibited by that crime .
by allowing an intent to cause grievous bodily harm to suffice for a murder conviction , the law is violating a general principle , turning the most serious of its offences into a constructive crime .
why should it be necessary to â€˜ construct â€™ a murder conviction out of this lesser intent ?
there are arguments in favour of this : death is final , murder is the gravest crime , and there is no significant moral difference between someone who chooses to cause really serious injury and someone who sets out to kill .
no one can predict whether a serious injury will result in death â€” that may depend on the victim 's physique , on the speed of an ambulance , on the distance from the hospital , and on a range of other medical and individual matters .
if one person chooses to cause serious injury to another , it should be presumed that he or she realizes that there is always a risk of death , and such cases show a sufficiently wanton disregard for life as to warrant the label â€˜ murder â€™ if death results .
the counter-arguments , which would uphold the principle of correspondence , are that breach of that principle is unnecessary when the amplitude of the crime of manslaughter lies beneath murder , and also that the definition of grievous bodily harm includes a number of injuries which are most unlikely to put the victim 's life at risk .
in the leading case of cunningham lord edmund-davies ( dissenting ) gave the example of breaking someone 's arm : that is a really serious injury , but one which is unlikely to endanger the victim 's life .
so in practice the â€˜ grievous bodily harm â€™ rule goes further than the arguments of its protagonists would support .
would it be right , then , to confine the fault element in murder to an intent to kill ?
that would have the merit of simplicity , but would it strike the right note socially ?
there are powerful arguments in favour of saying that there are other killings where an intent to kill can not be established , and yet where the moral or social culpability is equal to that in most intentional killings .
of course , one can not be adamant about whether they merit the label â€˜ murder â€™ , because that is a question of drawing the line between murder and manslaughter , which is not susceptible of any precise resolution .
it is hard to argue conclusively that the category of murder should be smaller or larger ( unless the death penalty or a mandatory life sentence follows ) ; it is a question of social judgment .
let us briefly consider some of the possibilities .
the fault element for many serious offences is intent or recklessness : why should this not suffice for murder ?
the question is whether all killings in which the defendant is aware of the risk of death are sufficiently serious to warrant the term â€˜ murder â€™ .
one answer sometimes given is that they are not , because a driver who overtakes on a bend , knowingly taking the risk that there is a car travelling in the opposite direction , should not be labelled a murderer if a collision and death happen to ensue .
this example assumes that a sympathy for motorists with overwhelm any tendency to logical analysis .
one might ask whether motorists are ever justified in knowingly taking risks with other people 's lives .
yet if the example is modified a little , so that the overtaking is on a country road at night and the risk is known to be slight , it becomes questionable whether the causing of death in these circumstances should be labelled in the same way as intentional killings .
this is not to suggest that motorists should be treated differently .
the point is rather that , even though knowingly taking risks with other people 's lives is usually unjustifiable , taking a slight risk is less serious than intentionally causing death .
in discussing the boundaries of murder , we are concerned with classification , not exculpation .
to classify all reckless killings as murder might be too broad , but the point remains that some reckless killings may be thought no less heinous than intentional killings .
can a satisfactory line be drawn here ?
one approach would be to draw the line by reference to the degree of probability .
murder is committed in those situations where d caused death by an act or omission which he knew had death as the probable or highly probable result .
a version of this test of foresight of high probability is used in several other european countries ; it was introduced into english law by the decision in hyam v.
dpp ( 1975 ) , but abandoned in moloney ( 1985 ) on grounds of uncertainty .
a second approach is to frame the law in such a way as to make it clear that the court should make a moral judgment on the gravity of the defendant 's conduct .
section 210.2 of the model penal code includes within murder those reckless killings which manifest â€˜ extreme indifference to the value of human life â€™ .
scots law treats as murder killings with â€˜ wicked recklessness â€™ , a phrase which directs the court 's attention to the circumstances of the killing .
both the model penal code test and the scots test may be reduced to circularity , however , for when one asks how extreme or how wicked the recklessness should be , the only possible answer is : â€˜ wicked or extreme enough to justify the stigma of a murder conviction â€™ .
admittedly , the model penal code does contain a list of circumstances which may amount to extreme indifference , which assists the courts and increases the predictability of verdicts in a way that scots law does not , but the essence of both approaches is that there is no precise way of describing those non-intentional killings which are as heinous as intentional killings .
their protagonists argue that the law of murder is so important socially that derogation from the principle of maximum certainty should be allowed in favour of more accurate labelling by the courts ; opponents argue that the principle of maximum certainty is needed here specifically to reduce the risk of verdicts based on discriminatory or irrelevant factors , such as distaste for the defendant 's background , allegiance , or other activities .
a third , more precise formulation derives from the recommendations of the criminal law revision committee in 1980 , namely , that a killing should be classified as murder in those situations where there is an intention to cause serious injury coupled with awareness of the risk of death .
neither an intention to cause serious injury nor recklessness as to death should be sufficient on its own , but together they restrict one another , producing a test which both satisfies the criterion of certainty and marks out some heinous but non-intended killings .
a fourth approach , adopted by english law until 1957 and still in force in many american jurisdictions , is some form of felony-murder rule : anyone who kills during the course of a felony ( or , more restrictively , a serious crime of violence ) or whilst resisting arrest should be convicted of murder .
thus stated , there is no reference to the defendant 's intention or awareness of the risks : the fact that d has chosen to commit rape , robbery , or another serious offence , and has caused death thereby , is held to constitute sufficient moral grounds for placing the killing in the highest category .
plainly , this is a form of constructive criminal liability : the murder conviction is constructed out of the ingredients of a lesser offence .
presumably the justification is that d has already crossed a high moral/social threshold in choosing to commit such a serious offence , and should therefore be held liable for whatever consequences ensue , however unforeseeable they may be .
the objections would be reduced if awareness of the risk of death was also required : in other words , if the test were the commission of a serious offence of violence plus recklessness as to death .
the effect of that test would be to pick out those reckless killings which occurred when d had already manifested substantial moral and legal culpability , and to classify them as murder .
four alternative approaches have been described , and many others could be listed .
the point is that the traditional concepts of intention and recklessness do not , of themselves , appear to be sufficiently well focused to mark out those killings which are the most heinous .
the law must resort to some kind of moral and social evaluation of conduct if it is to identify and separate out the most heinous killings .
many people might think that a person who causes death whilst using an unlawfully held firearm or explosives ought to be convicted of murder because there is , generally speaking , no excuse for using such dangerous equipment .
some of the people thus covered would be armed robbers , others would be terrorists .
the armed robber might say that he had no intention of using the firearm , that he carried it with him simply to frighten the victim , and that it went off accidentally : if the jury believes that , should he be convicted of murder ?

francesca simon describes some of the pitfalls â€” and how to avoid them
by francesca simon
debbie adams had to let her east end terrace house in london in a hurry when her husband was re-located to ireland with two months ' notice .
she went to a local letting agency , landlords of 41 roman road , bethnal green , london e2 , who found a tenant that day .
she also employed landlords to manage the let .
as is common practice , landlords kept the tenant 's deposit of â£650 and told debbie they would take their entire fee of â£881 up front , so she expected no rent for the first month .
but july also passed without debbie receiving any money .
â€˜ i phoned and said , â€˜ where 's the money ? â€™ and was told there were problems with the book-keeper , who would be coming in to sort it out , â€™ says debbie .
â€˜ but nothing happened and i never heard from them . â€™
she repeatedly phoned landlords , but was either unable to get an answer or told that manager howard keizner was unavailable .
finally , after the third month passed with no rent received , debbie phoned the tenants , asked them to pay her directly , and sent landlords a recorded-delivery letter , which was returned , and finally one by ordinary post stating that landlords were no longer employed as the managing agents .
because they had n't done any management , debbie felt landlords were entitled only to the 10 per cent tenant-finding fee and therefore owed her â£2,400 ( 3 months ' rent plus the deposit ) .
in december 1991 she sued .
landlords did n't acknowledge the writ , so in january debbie 's solicitor requested a judgment in default for the full amount plus interest and court fees , a total of â£2,453.24 .
just before the court was due to hear the request her solicitor received a cheque for â£2,400 .
â€˜ they had n't paid the interest and court fees , but we got back every single penny they owed .
we were lucky , â€™ says debbie adams .
howard keizner , of landlords , said : â€˜ there were a lot of complications with this particular letting and management . â€™
but he declined further comment .
last week he promised to supply us with a written explanation of the way his company had treated debbie , but it never arrived .
yusuf and shabira gulamali were less fortunate .
they lost over â£4,000 dealing with two letting agencies which closed down without paying them the rent and tenants ' deposit owed on their wembley flat .
they hired the first agent , â€˜ digs â€™ , of oxford street , to manage as well as to let their flat .
the gulamalis received their rent for the first three months , then nothing for four months , and were told the computer was broken , the accounts were being moved , the cheque was in the post , and so on .
â€˜ after four months they closed down owing us â£3,500 , â€™ says shabira .
â€˜ together with some other clients we took the owner to court but he escaped to spain . â€™
the second time round they dealt with r. and b. lettings in london nw10 , who they instructed just to find a tenant .
the gulamalis never received the agreement form , the tenants ' deposit or the first month 's rent .
â€˜ finally , we went to the office and they gave us a cheque , which bounced . â€™
the offices of r and b. lettings are now up for sale .
â€˜ anyone can set up a letting agency , â€™ says david galsworthy , vice president of the national association of estate agents .
â€˜ they come and go , so it pays to deal with a member of a professional body , such as the naea , the royal institute of chartered surveyors or the incorporated society of valuers and auctioneers .
in case of a dispute you can complain to the professional body , and members are bonded , which means that deposits and rent are covered in case of fraud or dishonesty . â€™
if you are thinking of letting your property , the following points will help to safeguard your interests :
ask any agency you are considering using if they are a member of one of the above professional associations .
if in doubt , ask to see proof of their membership .
if , in addition to finding a tenant , the agency is managing the let , you should be paid every month , less a tenant-finding fee of between two and four weeks ' rent .
the agency will keep the tenant 's deposit until the tenant leaves .
if the letting agent is not managing the flat , the tenant 's deposit should be given to the owner immediately .
expect to pay a management fee of up to 15 per cent .
some agencies deduct it every month , others want it all up front , so shop around .
if the owner is abroad , the agent will also collect tax at the standard rate of 25 per cent , which will be deducted from your monthly rent cheque .
letting agencies should never charge tenants a finder 's fee , although according to galsworthy , many agencies do .
â€˜ it 's not ethical as they are acting for the landlord , â€™ he says .
the self-regulating naea has 10,000 members , of which 2,000 also do letting and management .
but galsworthy believes there is a clear need for the licensing of all letting agents .
â€˜ we want everyone to be licensed , but the government did n't think it necessary .
section 22 of the 1979 estate agents act dealing with bonding , licensing and standards of competency has not been brought in .
but we must have a common code and we must have licensing , â€™ he said .
until then , owners and tenants beware .
travel : copse and robbers christopher somerville sees how woodland has usurped the ancient cattle thieves of the cheviot hills
by christopher somerville
when a charlton chief sat down to dinner in times gone by and found a spur on the table where his meal should have been , he knew the cupboard was bare once more .
his wife was telling him to saddle up and steal a fresh batch of cattle from his neighbour 's herds .
the families of north tynedale in westernmost northumberland â€” charltons and robsons , milburns and dodds â€” were never slow to lay hands on each other 's property in the lawless old days .
here , where the scottish border ran across the cheviot hills , far from civilisation , â€˜ reiving â€™ , or cattle-thieving , was a way of life .
remoteness is still the keynote of this region , but a charlton reiving party would be hard put to it these days to work up a good gallop along the upper reaches of the north tyne river .
since 1926 the western fringes of the cheviots have been planted with 250 square miles of close-packed conifers , while in their depths sprawl the seven miles of the kielder water reservoir , europe 's largest man-made lake .
i found it hard to picture what kind of landscape those statistics might have shaped , until i opened the ordnance survey map to find half of it coloured green with a great blue stain in the centre .
kielder water is beautiful , and the kielder trees formidably impressive in their domination of the hills .
but by the time i had turned off the road from bellingham at kielder village and driven up the bumpy forest drive to east kielder farm , i was longing for the sight of something other than water and trees .
relief was at hand .
the farm stands on a spur of moorland on the northern edge of the forest , and within 10 minutes i had turned my back on the corduroy battalions of trees and was striding under a still , cloudy sky over tussocks of rush and coarse grass , with my face to the long , bare shoulders of open hillside that flank the winding shallows of the east kielder burn .
the footpath that runs with the burn is not one of those carefully waymarked and leafleted by the forestry commission .
there are few attractions for the kielder tourist here .
the burn threads a wild and inhospitable crevice of the hills , where the wind blows cold and the sense of isolation grows with each lonely mile .
walking here , you leave the 20th century behind on the outskirts of the forest and enter the reconstructed emptiness in which the reivers and cross-border raiders of the past could operate unhindered .
i squelched across tiny burns running in black channels of peat , and stood looking down from the hillside on to the grey roofs of scaup farm .
the hollow barking of a dog came from one of the stone sheds , but there was no sign of life around the buildings .
scaup must be just about the loneliest farm in england , tucked down in the shelter of the hills with kielder forest 's dark mass blocking its southward view and the narrowing valley of the burn filling half the sky to the north .
the east kielder burn divides here into scaup burn and white kielder burn .
i dropped down the hill to ford white kielder upstream of the ruined farmstead of kielder head , where a line of stunted alders , shaggy with lichen , leaned over their leafless reflections in the peat-brown water .
spring comes late to this windm_bitten and rain-soaked valley .
but there were new-born lambs in the sheep pens of scaup , and a cheery â€˜ hello now â€™ from the farmer and his wife tending them .
those were the last human voices i heard all day .
no-one lives up here in the cleft of the white kielder burn .
the rough land is altogether too harsh and unyielding , giving sustenance only to sheep , and to the conifers high on the flanks of east kielder moor and grey mares knowe , immense sweeps of hillside to right and left of the valley .
the footpath on the left bank of the burn was little better than a sheep track , but there were clues to its former importance as a droving road over the hills to byrness in redesdale .
large boulders stood out beside the path as grey blobs in the featureless sheets of pale grass , and flat stones had been placed as bridges across the burns , their backs hollowed by the tread of feet through the centuries .
following these now disregarded signs of past activity along the old path , i traversed the hillside and came down to a crumbling stone sheepfold with the roofless remains of a shepherd 's hut built into one wall .
the tiny single room was jammed with the mossy timbers of disused sheep pens , but the little iron fire grate that once warmed the hardy men who worked here was still set in the foot of the hut 's tottering gable end , and the massive stone lintel had not yet fallen from its place above the doorway .
a dipper flew up from the burn as i emerged from the hut , his white breast flashing as he darted downstream .
somewhere ahead in the crags of kielderhead moor a hawk was whistling , a piercing sound in the lonely valley , overlain for a few heart-stopping moments by the snarl of a jet .
that jarring manifestation of furious technology seemed as remote and ridiculous as a dream , as silence settled down on kielderhead and the hawk 's whistle came down from the moors .
the valley of the white kielder burn steepened again as i trudged north , its curves tightening .
now the path ran through heather high above the burn , past circular sheepfolds long disused and over the stony beds of side streams where the grass hung smooth and inviting , concealing ankle-breaking drops .
a mile above the shepherd 's hut the hillsides ceased their upward rolling and curved together to form a dead-end valley of broad-breasted slopes five miles from the nearest tarmac road , hidden deep in the folds of the moors .
the old drover 's road turned aside here and climbed under the rock faces of white crags to continue its lonely course over girdle fell and down into redesdale .
i could have gone with it , giving myself four blissful miles of upland walking followed by as many miserable hours of fruitless searching for return transport to east kielder farm .
instead i lay back in the heather and savoured the trickle of the burn and the crisp smell of peat-laden ground .
not a sign of spring had yet penetrated this secret valley , but another month would put that right .
there were five miles of return tramping to face , but they , too , could wait awhile .
election 1992 : and what can the politicians do for meadowell ?
probably nothing at all
â€˜ joyriding â€™ riots propelled tyneside 's meadowell estate to national prominence last september .
has the election campaign penetrated its grim streets ?
by martyn harris
at the drop-in centre on south meadowell , labour candidate paddy cosgrove has dropped in to meet the people â€” mostly fat ladies in shellsuits with laps full of chips .
â€˜ you all know me , â€™ says paddy , and a fat lady with good timing says , â€˜ i do n't know you .
never seen you in me life . â€™
on the floor a toddler peels more chips from a congealed , bluish mass and feeds them to a baby .
another digs the cream from the centre of a pink fancy and smears it in his hair .
paddy cosgrove , councillor and barrister , in candidates ' pinstripes , sits tensely on the edge of his plastic chair .
â€˜ i 'm a regular visitor to this estate â€¦ â€™
â€˜ who does he say he is ? â€™ says a second fat lady .
â€˜ that liberal , paddy ashgrove â€¦ â€™
â€˜ he 's better looking on tv â€¦ â€™
â€˜ he 's only come because the press are here , â€™ says the first fat lady .
and paddy cosgrove blushes .
political consciousness is low on the meadowell estate .
turnout at the last election was around 50 per cent , and with the thinning of the electoral roll brought by the poll tax , will be even lower this time .
they are mostly labour voters but several confuse their labour candidate with the leader of the liberal democrats .
very few know their mp is a conservative , and hardly anyone that his name is neville trotter , defender of a slender 2,500 majority .
by most measures meadowell is the worst council estate in britain , and probably the most notorious since the riots last september , which followed the deaths of joyriders colin atkins and dale robson in a police chase .
in fact meadowell is an elastoplast name like sizewell , invented in the 1970s to disguise what was already a running sore .
when built in 1938 it was the ridges , which is still what they call it locally â€” a slum clearance project on the north bank of the tyne , 10 miles east of newcastle .
its first inhabitants were shipyard and fishquay workers from the riverside towns of north shields and wallsend , who moved happily from their tumbledown terraces to these fine new houses with inside toilets and gardens .
many , like ronnie collyer , a retired shipyard worker , still live here and are still proud of the place .
all the trouble , says ronnie , is down to â€˜ a few families who doa n't keep their young â€™ uns in order .
and then the media coom down and blow everything up . â€™
he has polished shoes , a close shave , and too much pride for a free drink .
â€˜ it 's a canny place the ridges , with plenty of good folk . â€™
but something was wrong from the start .
some say it was the importing of whole streets of fighting families from the fishquays , with their dockland diversions of prostitution , drug-dealing and handling .
others say it was the shortage of pubs , shops , churches , transport and police stations .
by the 1950s , the ridges was the criminal ghetto of newcastle , and by the 1970s a costly council manicure job had turned it into a free-fire zone .
paths and boundaries vanished , allowing the tides of street life to wash right up to the doorsteps .
joyriders used front lawns to practise their handbrake turns .
car theft became so common that private cars virtually disappeared from the area .
shops like greengrocers and chippies , with pitiful cash takings , were routinely subjected to armed robberies with shotguns , balaclavas â€” the whole bit .
when i ask the fat ladies at the drop-in centre what is the one thing that would do most to improve the estate they say â€˜ get rid of the kids â€™ and they are only half joking .
the age structure of meadowell means it is awash with teenagers , whose only pastimes are having babies and body-building .
do your husbands come here ?
i ask , and they all laugh .
â€˜ the men are all useless â€” sitting indoors if there 's trouble in the street .
it 's women have to go out and deal with it . â€™
by the time of the riots a quarter of all houses on the estate were boarded up and burned out by infant petrol bombers .
unemployment was 80 per cent on some streets .
in meadowell primary , which has 232 children , every one was receiving a clothing grant .
the area had effectively been abandoned by the authorities , a fact which became clear during the riot itself , when police waited five hours to enter the estate and put down the disturbances .
â€˜ and there were never more than a few dozen ringleaders , â€™ bob mather , a local butcher , tells me .
â€˜ i was stood outside me shop all night , and most were no more than kids . â€™
eight months on and little has changed â€” if anything it is rather worse .
unemployment is up another 17 per cent ; more houses and shops are boarded up ; burglaries and joyriding continue â€” and if there is less ram-raiding it is only because 50 or so of the hardest cases are still behind bars .
a food co-op which tried to replace the burned-out shops has been closed after several break-ins , and even the drop-in centre is burgled weekly , according to project worker sheila auld .
there is a new phone box , ripped from the wall and lying on the floor of her office to prove it .
meadowell has even discovered a new martyr in the shape of one willy hunter , a local hard nut awaiting trial for murder , and allegedly the victim of a police frame-up .
â€˜ free willy hunter â€™ say the graffiti , next to the old , fading graffiti for dale robson and colin atkins .
my friend kevin , muscleman and minicab driver , says the lads would be out rioting for willy now if it was n't tipping down with rain the whole time .
a few things have been achieved , i suppose .
there are some posh flats going up at neighbouring royal quays which will provide building jobs : â€˜ it 's sun city in the middle of bantustan , â€™ a labour councillor said to me .
the cheviot housing association is slowly taking over property in south meadowell .
a new police station is to be built .
the government sponsored meadowell initiative makes noises in the north of the estate â€” but does pitifully little , painfully slowly .
north tyneside council says it is too starved of funds by central government to do much .
tory ministers , like michael heseltine who visited meadowell last november , say the cash shortages are due to council profligacy and bad management .
mp neville trotter is a pear-shaped tory with pear-shaped vowels who has little appeal to the people of meadowell , and a dwindling appeal in the middle-class suburbs where unemployment is also climbing .
paddy cosgrove , his likely replacement , is a council hack of 21 years standing and ideal backbench fodder , though it is hard to imagine him leading a crusade for meadowell .
when i ask the people of the estate what they want from this election some say they want cheviot to rebuild it and others that it would be better grassed over .
some say they should bring back hanging ; others say it is the politicians they should hang ; but most say there is nothing anybody can do at all .
general election : n trotter ( c ) 25,113 , p cosgrove ( lab ) 22,530 , d mayhew ( l/all ) 10,446 .
con maj : 2,583 .
sit , they said , but he would n't this week john major began to appear on a different kind of box .
in the last of his series on the leaders , frank johnson reports
by frank johnson
we were in the west country .
the prime minister was on his soapbox .
just up the road , at langport in somerset , was the birthplace of walter bagehot ( 1826â€“1877 ) , although as he directed his microphone at liberal democrat hecklers john major had other things on his mind .
the relevance is that bagehot was the first political commentator .
the travelling chaos of a modern party leader 's election entourage had carried major within a few miles of the home of the founder of the profession , a few of whose more troublesome contemporary practitioners are said to have caused him much irritation over the 16 months of his premiership .
â€˜ a liberal ?
he 's admitted to being a liberal ! â€™
major cried , jabbing a finger in the direction of one heckler .
the man had a liberal democrat rosette pinned to his cap .
he was also carrying an orange poster on a pole , urging a vote for the local liberal democrat candidate .
therefore the admission which the prime minister wrung from him could hardly be said to have been grudging .
but , like all the best soapbox orators , major had prepared his repartee in advance .
â€˜ i knew there was one here , â€™ he continued , meaning liberal democrats .
there were , in fact , about a score .
then came the passage , which appeared on the television news that evening and in the papers the next day , about the liberal democrats being the trojan horse that would let labour in .
there were also some lines intended for local consumption : â€˜ higher petrol prices from the liberal democrats â€¦ that 's not gon na help a rural area â€¦
â€™ what would bagehot have made of him ?
like the heckler , he was a liberal .
there the similarity ends , since judging from his writings bagehot was a roaring snob , whereas judging from his heckles the heckler was not .
more to the point , it was bagehot who said : â€˜ a constitutional statesman is in general a man of common opinions and uncommon abilities . â€™
the statesman to whom he was referring was peel .
a political commentator of our own day , paul johnson , quoted it not long after major became prime minister to suggest that it was also true of him .
but is it still ?
b agehot 's phrase comes in a passage in which he appears to propound the dispiriting theory that a politician , if he wants to get anywhere , must appeal to â€˜ the average man â€™ .
the average man is â€˜ a cool , common person , with a considerate air , with figures in his mind , with his own business to attend to , with a set of ordinary opinions arising from and suited to ordinary life .
he ca n't bear novelty or originalities â€¦
original theories give trouble â€™ .
bagehot goes on to say of peel : â€˜ from a certain peculiarity of intellect and fortune , he was never in advance of his time .
of almost all the great measures with which his name is associated , he attained great eminence as an opponent before he attained even greater eminence as their advocate . â€™
that last sentence has more to do with kinnock than with major .
it is also a warning to all hack tories who think that it is a telling blow against kinnock to keep on pointing out that he has reversed his opinions about unilateral nuclear disarmament , british membership of the ec , or anything else .
but the most striking thing about bagehot 's essay on peel , in the light of the last full week of this election campaign , is that it simply does not apply to major at all .
common opinions were what got major into difficulties in the first place .
between his becoming prime minister and his party 's fall in the polls about 10 days ago , major did nearly everthing that common opinion wanted him to do .
this was true of what he did about both high policy and low politics .
for example , on high policy common opinion said that there was nothing for it but to stay in the erm .
he stayed in , and the recession worsened .
in low politics , common opinion â€” no less common for being expensively hired by conservative central office â€” encouraged him in the belief that he should fight much of the election sitting down .
he did so , and he looked like the questioner in the studio audience rather than the answerer .
the result was wobbly week , the second week of the campaign .
but last saturday major climbed on to that soapbox in luton .
until then , he had been that most inhuman of creatures â€” the public figure described by others as â€˜ very human â€™ .
now he really was human â€” unscripted , jokey , even a bit passionate .
the jubilant word from kinnock 's camp was that major was behaving more like an opposition leader than a prime minister .
but there seemed nothing wrong with the head of government appearing to be the challenger on the hustings .
president truman did so in a campaign which no-one expected him to win , and he won .
it is justified if the head of government is challenging something powerful .
kinnock complains of the alleged power of the tory tabloid press , but he has powers on his side too .
ninety per cent of his party 's cash comes from the unions , which will expect a return .
the british people have in the past found them rather more powerful than the corporations which are popularly supposed to finance the conservative party .
then there are all those schoolteachers , dons , television producers , writers on arts pages and members of the agitating classes who want a labour win in order to impose political correctness .
that is to say , they will have what the jesuits once attached such importance to : power over young or impressionable minds .
as the week went by , major rejected common opinion about two other large subjects : proportional representation and scottish devolution .
he hardened his opposition to both , despite the fact that his own party chairman had once favoured the first , and vocal forces within his scottish party were in support of the second .
e ven at this late hour , psephology , demographics and luck suggest that the tories could still emerge as the biggest single party in a hung parliament .
is it possible that major would rather go into opposition â€” with the dangers that would mean for his continued leadership of the conservative party â€” than offer pr and scottish devolution to the liberal democrats ?
if so , we are dealing with a more quixotic , romantic or principled figure than some of us used to think .
once that soapbox came out , major campaigned as if he would now do and say what he really thought .
was it too late ?
from central office , and from around his entourage , came the unmistakable signs of fair-weather friends preparing to detach themselves from blame for defeat .
and then , on thursday morning , when major 's election tour reached the daily mail ideal home exhibition , sir david english , the paper 's editor , was not there to greet him .
a junior spin doctor is reported to have muttered , though admittedly out of my earshot : â€˜ we 've been snubbed . â€™
not sir david !
some in the profession of political commentating would opt for bagehot as their formative influence , but mine has long been sir david â€” a founder of biased tory journalism .
his lack of humbug about political balance has always made him more honest than all the employees of bbc current affairs awaiting with glee the kinnock years .
eventually , sir david 's office issued a statement about the prime minister .
normally , a prime minister 's office would issue a statement about an editor .
but major makes a point of not being grand , and with sir david it is the other way about .
â€˜ sir david english was not informed of the visit and in consequence had no plans to attend the ideal home exhibition that day , â€™ the official statement announced .
faith in sir david 's leadership was restored .
scientists click over a way to save dolphins
by greg neale environment correspondent
hundreds of thousands of dolphins could be saved from death thanks to pioneering work by british scientists .
they believe they have found a cheap , practical means of preventing dolphins entangling themselves in monofilament drift fishing nets â€” the â€˜ walls of death â€™ believed to be responsible for killing large numbers of dolphins off cornwall this year .
but their work is hampered by lack of money .
so far they have received nothing from the government , little ec assistance and are running out of funds donated by individuals and industry .
the researchers , headed by dr margaret klinowska , a cambridge biologist , and david goodson , an expert on acoustic engineering at loughborough university , say new data shows that plastic sound reflectors to fishing nets can warn dolphins of hazards .
data to be published shortly draws on experiments including observations of freddy , the dolphin that has been living off the northumbrian coast for four years .
using equipment donated by racal , the scientists have analysed recordings of the â€˜ clicking â€™ dolphins make while hunting .
observations of freddy led them to conclude that dolphins use sonar while hunting .
they emit an intense , broad-band â€˜ click â€™ or pulse of sound .
echoes of the signal alert them to possible prey , at ranges up to 80â€“90 metres in shallow waters .
mr goodson , who became interested in the sonar capacity of dolphins after hearing one while swimming off the welsh coast , has experimented with various shapes of sound reflectors .
the most promising is eliptical , about 3â½in long .
the theory is that its internal air pocket will â€˜ bounce â€™ back the dolphin 's sonar signal , regardless of the direction of approach .
last autumn , dr klinowska , mr goodson and their team put the theories into practice .
in the moray firth , they placed a â€˜ headline barrier â€™ , from which they had suspended reflectors at two-metre intervals .
the movement of dolphins around the barrier was observed , using electronic equipment to monitor sonar activity .
â€˜ the results exceeded our expectations , â€™ said mr goodson .
dolphins swimming near the barrier altered their behaviour to avoid it , the result , the scientists believe , of them detecting sonar echoes from the reflectors .
dr klinowska said that , although it was necessary to be cautious about the findings , a combination of reflector devices and some modification of fishing gear might reduce deaths .
but the moray firth experiments were only possible after the naturalist dr david bellamy helped secure a donation from the co-operative wholesale society .
â€˜ our work is being delayed simply through the lack of funding , â€™ said dr klinowska .
the scientists hope to raise â£100,000 through an appeal by windsor safari park .
donations can be made to the dolphin research project c/o windsor safari park , windsor , berkshire sl4 4ay .
the arts : courtroom drama in the case of the bogus picassos
by michael pye
suppose you have a print by picasso , dali , miro or chagall , or sold one in the past few years : you have a special interest in a brooklyn courtroom this week .
hilda amiel , alleged to be the very godmother of fake art , has been arraigned for her part in what the us attorney calls the â€˜ single largest worldwide source and distribution network of bogus prints â€™ .
( she pleads not guilty . )
the feds claim to have seized 75,000 prints at the family firm , known with a nice irony as original artworks ltd .
they say there were blank sheets bearing dali 's signature alongside 20,000 fake miros and 650 fake chagalls .
the picassos , according to sotheby 's valuer , were â€˜ sloppy â€™ .
amiel is the first reputable dealer to be prosecuted , but more than 100 others as well as auction houses across america are now under subpoena to explain what they thought they were selling .
and the prints have been sold across europe â€” there 's been one arrest in denmark already â€” including britain .
the art world is very close to its own watergate .
the st petersburg national opera ( the â€˜ national â€™ ) , chaliapin 's company , is in new york for the first time .
the management of the kirov , that other opera house in st petersburg , are furious .
the core of the problem is simple : the national was invited to new york only last november , and the kirov is planning to tour this summer .
both are presenting the great russian warhorses , boris godunov and the queen of spades .
both companies expected to bring the bass vladimir ognovenko to sing boris and the mezzo-soprano irina bogatcheva .
( russian singers do n't spend their lives with one company any more . )
but kirov 's management , satra arts international , felt badly upstaged .
under pressure from satra , kirov told singers to choose between the companies .
the national 's boris godunov was built around ognovenko ; he had to stay home .
the mezzo irina bogatcheva , wife of the national 's artistic director stanislav gaudassinksy , agreed to limit her roles .
but that was n't enough .
for daring to come at all , she was cut from the kirov team .
she went home in tears at the weekend .
but her husband did have consolation on saturday , as we talked over scotch and peking duck : the sound of american cheers for his robust version of boris godunov .
la mama etc â€” for â€˜ experimental theatre company â€™ â€” is a tiny cauldron of a theatre on the lower east side , the creation of the extraordinary ellen stewart .
like any house that 's demanding , idiosyncratic , small and truly experimental , it 's in trouble â€” $150,000 in the red , with the serious prospect of closing .
la mama is the heart of the new york theatre avant-garde , a true anti-institution .
but it has distinguished alumni : billy crystal , who talked between the oscars , and oscar contenders bette midler and nick nolte among them .
you might expect them to rush to la mama 's aid .
but stewart snaps : â€˜ i do n't want to be disappointed so i 'm not going to ask for their help . â€™
instead , she 's been saved for the moment by an old-fashioned storyteller , worth millions â€” george lucas of star wars .
and virtue is rewarded .
nolte , midler , and crystal do n't even win oscars .
lucas did .
in the crusade to make everyone guilty about everything , there is a new technique : tetranalysis , the study of colour , sound , motion and form in movies .
the national association for the advancement of coloured people tried it to scourge hollywood ; but hollywood just giggled .
the naacp denounces the silence of the lambs because hannibal the cannibal shares his name with an african general , and the killer is buffalo bill ( yes , that 's a white man 's nickname , but the buffalo , naacp explain patiently , is associated with native americans ) .
it gets worse .
in bugsy , limos are black , cars are red and taxis are yellow ; all are ominous objects , the naacp says , in colours associated with racial minorities .
political correctness , just as we suspected , will be perfectly grey .
the arts : in the name of charity
by lewis jones
charity is a divine attribute , but we are enjoined to give forgetfully lest we fall into the absurd error of mistaking ourselves for gods .
the perils of ignoring this advice were well illustrated by angel of bengal ( c4 ) , the true stories documentary by anna raphael which was by turns hilarious and enraging .
the â€˜ angel â€™ in question was an american woman who calls herself rytasha .
apart from a particularly vicious-looking nose-job and alarming turquoise-coloured contact lenses , rytasha is rather beautiful , and in the 1970s , when she went by the name of ricki , she was a successful model ( she began life as maxine shenkman ) .
an earlier film by raphael , the persuaders ( 1986 ) , charted the transformation of ricki into rytasha , which occurred at the hare krishna temple in london , and her uneasy relationship with her guru there .
it would have been interesting to have seen the two films together .
since 1986 rytasha has broken awaym_from her guru and set up on her own with a charity called food relief international , which raises money from the fiercely competitive matrons of palm beach and distributes it to the starving people of bangladesh .
â€˜ she adaws bangladesh , â€™ gushed rytasha 's mother â€” the fiercest matron of them all , rejoicing in the improbable title of baroness thea von theilheimer shenkman .
she went on to list her daughter 's achievements : â€˜ she put in an irritation system â€¦
â€™ with no trace of a smile or a blush the baroness quickly corrected herself â€” â€˜ an irrigation system â€™ â€” but the slip was a telling one , and i 'm sure they would have appreciated it in bangladesh .
the villagers of ramsala , recipients of the palm beach dollars , explained to the cameras that they desperately needed a clinic .
â€˜ we told her that a mud hut would do , but she said no , she 'd build something pukka . â€™
a pukka building was duly erected , but its medical function has somehow been indefinitely postponed .
it is devoted instead to the worship of the charitable rytasha , who is not content simply to hand over the cash but insists , in an unfortunate hangover from her hare krishna days , on posturing as â€˜ a spiritual master â€™ .
the villagers seemed unimpressed , but were given no choice in the matter .
nor could the vaunted irrigation scheme be described as an unqualified success .
the money ran out before the scheme 's completion , and the villagers found themselves obliged to borrow the rest .
they begged rytasha for reimbursement , but none was forthcoming , and for the want of a few hundred pounds the village lost its crop for the year .
â€˜ now what are we supposed to do ? â€™ asked one of them .
â€˜ are we to sell our cattle or our land ? â€™
the most irritating thing about rytasha â€” and there were many â€” was that , though she does not speak their language , she presumes to teach them a spurious form of their own religion .
â€˜ one thing we do n't need in this subcontinent , â€™ professor rokeya kabeer observed , â€˜ is spiritual guidance â€” we have gurus a dime a dozen . â€™
they are far too civilised for that sort of thing in bangladesh , but i kept thinking wistfully of t. s. eliot 's lines in sweeney agonistes about â€˜ a nice little white little missionary stew â€™ .
city : lloyd 's members fail in bid to protect cash fund
by karen cooper
more than 800 lloyd 's of london members on syndicates managed by the loss-making gooda walker agency have failed in their legal attempt to prevent lloyd 's and members ' agents from drawing down their funds .
michael freeman , the solicitor who advised the members on court action , said yesterday : â€˜ this will cause the most dreadful hardship .
there is going to be a great deal of pain in the market place now . â€™
in an earlier than expected commercial court judgment , mr justice saville found that the members had not produced enough evidence of irregularities in the â€˜ lmx spiral â€™ , which sends catastrophe risks swirling round the market to stop the usual process of calling on cash deposits to make good syndicate losses .
however , he suggested there was perhaps a need to look into the system more closely .
costs were awarded to the members ' agents but not to lloyd 's .
the members , many of whom are unable to fulfil the latest â£101m cash call due on march 2 to cover 1989â€“90 losses on syndicates were seeking an interim injunction to stop members ' agents and lloyd 's dipping into their security .
they were challenging the â€˜ pay now sue later â€™ principle at lloyd 's , which says names should pay cash calls first and fight them later .
lloyd 's chairman david coleridge welcomed the judgment .
â€˜ we have every sympathy with those who have made substantial underwriting losses in recent years but lloyd 's owes its first duty to policyholders with valid claims which must be met , â€™ he said .
mr freeman said an appeal was â€˜ most unlikely , because we are not going to get any more evidence . â€™
earlier this month , preliminary findings from an investigation by kenneth randall found that the gooda walker agency may have overstated its syndicates ' profits between 1981 and 1988 through the use of time and distance policies , about which it had failed to inform its auditors in at least one syndicate .
peter nutting , who led the association of outhwaite members to a succesful settlement , said he sympathised with gooda walker names , but â€˜ if the names were not going to pay these calls , who did they think was going to pay them ? â€™
meanwhile , members who were not part of the â£116m outhwaite out-of-court settlement have voted to press their claims for compensation through the 1992 outhwaite names association .
it plans to issue a protective writ but is hoping to achieve a settlement .
â€˜ the nhs is not for sale â€™ virginia bottomley talks to george jones in her first interview since joining the cabinet
by george jones
the new health secretary , mrs virginia bottomley , set herself an ambitious target yesterday â€” to â€˜ take the politics â€™ out of the national health service .
but her desire to provide a period of stability for nearly one million people employed by the nhs is coupled with a fierce determination to maintain the momentum of reform , with the overwhelming majority of hospitals becoming self-governing trusts by the mid-1990s .
labour sought to turn the general election into a referendum on the nhs , asking voters for a mandate to reverse the changes .
mrs bottomley is convinced the tory victory provides the opportunity to entrench the reforms â€” and to give doctors , nurses and managers the confidence to make them work .
in her first full interview since being appointed health secretary , she said the election result , and mr major 's unequivocal commitment to the nhs , had finally â€˜ nailed the lie â€™ about privatisation of health care .
â€˜ the nhs is not for profit .
it is not for sale .
it will continue to be true to its founding principles , available to all and free at the point of delivery , â€™ she said .
she recalled a promise made by mr major when he became prime minister : that he would work for a nation at ease with itself .
â€˜ i want to see a health service at ease with itself â€” optimistic and confident about its essential work .
health is something which touches every individual and family in the country , â€™ she said .
â€˜ but there must be changes .
an organisation that does n't change fossilises .
health needs to develop and alter . â€™
by next year , she is confident that two thirds of hospitals will have become self-governing trusts within the nhs .
she pledged that the government would safeguard those that did not opt for trust status , but she expected this to be a minority .
the government will also encourage more family doctors to hold budgets to â€˜ buy â€™ services for patients , and is looking at ways to enable smaller practices to team up to secure the advantages of fund holding .
the election result has given the conservatives five years in which to press ahead with the changes .
most people are likely to judge the reforms on how long they have to wait for treatment â€” the issue behind the â€˜ jennifer 's ear â€™ controversy during the election campaign .
mrs bottomley stressed her commitment to the patient 's charter , which has already eliminated almost all waits of more than two years for nhs operations .
the next step is to ensure that , from march , no one should have to wait more than 18 months for a hip or knee replacement or a cataract operation .
a national standard will also be set for outpatient waiting times .
mrs bottomley 's first big test as health secretary will come this summer with the annual public spending round , which will be conducted against a background of concern over high government borrowing and pressure from the tory right for public spending cuts .
the conservative manifesto contained a commitment to increase , year by year , the level of â€˜ real resources â€™ committed to the nhs â€” though it put no figure on the extra money to be allocated .
mrs bottomley , representing â€˜ caring conservatism â€™ , will face mr michael portillo , the new treasury chief secretary , who is equally keen to establish his right-wing credentials by demonstrating he can keep keep a tight grip on the public purse strings .
she acknowledged that there could be difficult times ahead .
â€˜ it will always be the case that the holder of my office will need to fight the corner of the health service and there will always , inevitably , be more than we can do . â€™
but she stressed there would be no let-up in the search for greater efficiency .
as well as fighting for more money , her task was to ensure that â€˜ every last pound â€™ was spent as effectively as it could be .
her priorities include giving more encouragement to medical research ; emphasis on preventive health to make the nhs a â€˜ health as well as a sickness service â€™ , with the publication shortly of new national targets for reducing deaths from heart disease and cancers ; and pressing ahead with care in the community .
as a former psychiatric social worker , mrs bottomley is determined to improve standards of care for mentally ill and handicapped people .
â€˜ it is not acceptable to have people who require a home confined to long-stay institutions when they could be in more domestic settings .
that is a real challenge , â€™ she said .
mrs bottomley 's rise to the top has been swift , with only four years between her first ministerial post and a seat at the cabinet table .
but she bridles at suggestions that the inclusion of two women â€” mrs gillian shephard at the department of employment and herself â€” has excluded more able men from the cabinet .
â€˜ prime ministers always have to consider balance in the cabinet â€” and at least we now have the same number of women as old etonians in john major 's team , â€™ she said .
a non-punitive paradigm of probation practice : some sobering thoughts l.r. singer
lawrence singer is an assistant chief probation officer with merseyside probation service .
beforehand he worked as a probation officer for berkshire probation service and later as a research officer for somerset probation service where he undertook the research reported here .
the paradigm which is described originates from doctoral research into generic probation practice and has been presented in a book adult probation and juvenile supervision : beyond the care-control dilemma ( 1989 , gower ) .
summary
the government white paper crime , justice and protecting the public proposes a radical change for probation practice .
henceforth probation work will no longer be an alternative to punishment but an alternative form of punishment .
this article challenges the conceptual and practical appropriateness of applying the notion of punishment to the probation context .
probation officers , it is argued , are concerned with establishing rules for probationers and not inflicting pain on them .
an alternative non-punitive paradigm of probation practice is described .
the paradigm is based on the joint supervisory aims of support and surveillance which are implemented through the methods of counselling , assisting , directing , and monitoring .
to illustrate the paradigm , reference is made to an alcohol education course developed for offenders in trouble through drink .
the efficacy of the alcohol project and the non-punitive paradigm is demonstrated by the results reported from a three year evaluation study covering 152 offenders .
the article concludes with an affirmation of the disciplined but non-punitive character of current probation work and argues that , to successfully protect the public and reintegrate offenders into the community , the probation officer 's employment of established social work knowledge , skills , and values is a strength not a weakness .
the aim of this article is to challenge the assertion contained in the white paper crime , justice and protecting the public ( home office , 1990a ) that probation practice can be conceived of as a form of punishment in the community .
issue will be taken with the appropriateness of applying the concept of punishment to the probation context through reference to a demanding and successful probation project concerned with offenders in trouble through drink .
in describing the project , a non-punitive model for understanding probation practice will be developed .
this non-punitive paradigm will provide a framework for contrasting the efficacy of current practice with future plans inappropriately to transform probation work into â€˜ a new approach to punishment in the community â€™ ( p. 18 , para. 4.3 ) .
the punitive approach anticipated for the probation service in the white paper is underpinned by a definition of punishment that resides â€˜ in the restrictions on liberty and in the enforcement of the orders â€™ .
the white paper goes on to emphasize : â€˜ it is the loss of liberty involved in carrying out the terms of the order rather than the activities carried out during the order which is the punishment â€™ ( p. 18 , para. 4.4 ) .
notwithstanding the popular appeal and political capital to be derived from such a humane-sounding statement , this definition is nevertheless at variance with the traditional understanding of the meaning of punishment .
discourses on punishment and dictionary definitions of the term clearly specify the central feature of punishment as being the infliction of pain rather than the loss of liberty per se ( hudson , 1987 ) .
the conceptual and practical implications of this discrepancy will be examined in the third and final section of this article .
beforehand , however , consideration will be given first to the probation project and second to its evaluation .
in these sections punishment will be understood to mean the infliction of pain and the review of the project will seek to demonstrate that the probation practice described is not only more demanding but also more effective than this traditional understanding of punishment .
at a time when the home secretary is inviting the probation service to â€˜ move centre stage in the criminal justice system â€™ ( nacro , 1990 , p. 17 ) it may seem misguided and unnecessarily pedantic to take issue with the white paper 's notion of punishment .
punishment is just a word after all : nothing more than convenient political rhetoric meriting only lip-service from probation managers and practitioners poised at the â€˜ window of opportunity â€™ .
however , this fails to acknowledge a fundamental axiom of social work practice ; namely that language not only reflects but also shapes social reality .
as davies ( 1981 ) has pointed out , speech is the basic tool of the social worker .
what we say influences what we think and in turn , what we do .
if punishment is assimilated into the probation glossary it will inevitably influence the sort of practice the service undertakes .
in the sections to follow the stark question is therefore put â€˜ is the probation service in the business of inflicting pain ? â€™ and the answer which unfolds may be summarized â€˜ no , because it neither aspires nor wishes to ! â€™
the project : more demanding than punishment
government concern about the problem of drink-related offending is as old as the probation service .
indeed , as bochel ( 1976 ) has shown , the establishment of a probation service in england and wales was inextricably linked with work undertaken with offenders in trouble through drink .
almost a century later the new approach to punishment in the community outlined by the white paper once again presents alcohol misuse as a key problem requiring community-based intervention .
â€˜ alcohol â€™ , the white paper states , â€˜ is implicated in a wide variety of crimes , drunken driving , offences of public disorder and domestic violence â€™ ( p. 21 , para. 4. 14 ) .
in describing its vision of effective supervision the white paper goes on to note :
offenders take part in alcohol education programmes so that they can learn to drink sensibly .
they learn about the relative strength of different drinks , the amount which is safe to consume , and the pitfalls to avoid ( e.g. competitive drinking and buying â€˜ rounds â€™ ) ( p. 37 , para. 7.11 ) .
as a summary of alcohol education programmes , this is something of a simplification .
however it does provide a useful introduction to the origins of the alcohol education course reported here .
furthermore , it highlights the suitability of referring to this type of project for testing out the appropriateness of applying the notion of punishment to probation practice .
in 1985 the management of somerset probation service was faced with the fact that nearly one in three of the offenders supervised in their area were either known to be or suspected of misusing alcohol ( singer , 1985 ) .
aware of practitioners ' frustration in not being able to work effectively with these problematic clients , probation management , in partnership with the voluntary sector , determined to develop an alcohol education course ( aec ) .
by 1986 , when social inquiry report monitoring information covering 1,257 offenders indicated that the problem of drink-related offending was virtually as great for pre- as for post-sentence clients , that is , alcohol was cited as a pre-offence problem in twenty-nine per cent of cases , a specialist project worker had been appointed .
towards the end of 1986 an aec was launched and has been running ever since .
the aim of the course is to educate offenders about alcohol to facilitate a lasting change in their subsequent use of this drug .
this aim is underpinned by three interrelated objectives and it is not without significance how they complement and serve to implement the white paper 's own trinity of â€˜ aims of supervision â€™ , that is , protection of the public , prevention of reoffending and successful reintegration of the offender in the community ( p. 35 , para. 7.3 ) .
these were :
1 .
to increase knowledge about alcohol so that future alcohol use can be more informed and therefore more prudent .
2 .
to instil or reinforce responsible drinking attitudes and behaviour .
3 .
to encourage the maintenance of , or , where appropriate , a reduction to a personally and socially safe level of alcohol unit intake .
to meet these objectives the aec has a structured programme involving group and individual contact , that is , six group sessions sandwiched between one-to-one interviews held immediately before and after the group .
the initial one-to-one meeting , held with one of the two group leaders , serves to clarify what participants can expect from the course and what is expected of them .
a standard contract which covers conditions of attendance and an agreement to complete various assignments between group sessions is signed by each participant .
the final interview entails a personalized review of the course , as well as the formulation of a follow-up plan to be undertaken with the offender 's supervising officer .
the course employs a variety of materials and techniques including the use of checklists , magazine and newspaper clippings , quizzes , videos , brainstorm exercises , discussions , drink diaries , and role plays ( menary , 1986 ) .
the aec is primarily intended for young adults subject to a probation order with a special condition of attendance ( schedule 11 4a(ii) criminal justice act 1982 ) and reflects the fact that most somerset offenders in trouble through drink commit serious offences and/or possess a substantial number of previous convictions .
in short , they are seriously at risk of committing further offences and becoming trapped in the revolving door of custody .
the development of the somerset aec both accords with and constitutes a practical example of the home office 's recent guidance to sentencers :
in recent years the probation service has devoted increasing resources to supervising the more serious and persistent offenders .
probation orders which are combined with constructive , disciplined and effective programmes of supervision are increasingly being used for offenders who stand to receive custodial sentences ( 1990b , p. 35 ) .
from the description of the aec already given the demanding and disciplined nature of the course can be appreciated .
however , the course is not punitive ; it is not concerned with the infliction of pain .
instead , it is concerned with the establishment of rules .
this is plainly evident from the section of the contract signed by each participant where what is expected of them is spelt out :
you will be expected to keep a drink diary throughout the course , and make attempts at reducing the amount you drink if it is greater than accepted healthy drinking levels .
you must be willing to be helped and help others â€” your experiences will be useful to other group members .
you must attend 8 sessions ( these will consist of : an introductory session , six group sessions and a final assessment interview ) .
you must not drink before the session .
you must be on time â€” lateness will count as an absence .
unlike the prison inmate , aec participants can not sit back and passively do their time .
probation practice is not , however , solely concerned with the establishment of rules .
as has been demonstrated elsewhere with regard to the generic probation setting ( singer , 1989 ) , the supervision of offenders involves two overarching aims : namely support and surveillance .
support refers to anything which is said or done to help the offender solve or mitigate their personal or social problems : surveillance to anything which is said or done to induce the offender to conform to socially acceptable standards of behaviour .
these aims are implemented through the practice of four distinguishable but related methods .
in terms of support , there is counselling and assisting : in terms of surveillance , there is directing and monitoring .
each of these four methods are employed during the eight sessions .
although summarized as an alcohol education course , the sessions are not just concerned with giving information but also with enabling participants to make practical use of it .
in the first group session the counselling method is registered in the course tutor 's notes ( menary , 1986 ) by the explanation : â€˜ this session aims to get participants to consider the subject of alcohol in ways they had not thought of in the past â€™ ( p. 3 ) .
during this session the importance of monitoring is also emphasized :
drinks exercises introduce the notion of measurement , concentration of alcohol content ; information which will be necessary to carry out the recording of alcohol consumption throughout the duration of the course ( p. 3 ) .
in the fifth group session entitled â€˜ focus on the individual â€™ , the counselling and the monitoring combine with the directing and assisting methods .
at the start of the session the tutor 's notes make clear that directing extends beyond enforcing the conditions of attendance :
this session allows for an in depth examination of the drinking diaries over the last five weeks â€” identifying the risky circumstances or situations â€¦ .
the aim at the end of the session is to encourage participants to make rules for their future drinking which will lead to a lessening of identified problems ( p. 4 ) .
similarly , the assisting extends beyond simply providing handouts of useful information :
it is important that participants are provided with the skills to reduce their drinking levels or handle more effectively â€˜ pub centred â€™ problems .
the use of role play , incorporating previously discussed difficulties ( i.e. homework assignment session 4 ) in â€˜ real â€™ or set up situations provides an opportunity for testing these skills .
probably the best illustration of the assisting method in action during the course comes in the fifth session when somerset practitioners take the logic of working with the problem in the community to its ultimate conclusion .
in the second half of the session , course leaders sponsor participants to an evening at the pub for the purpose of practising drinking skills and purchasing non-alcoholic drinks .
the counselling , assisting , directing , and monitoring on the aec give substance to the aims of support and surveillance and provide the basis for establishing a model of probation practice .
punishment has no place in this model .
instead the aec can best be understood as an example of a non-punitive paradigm of probation practice .
twenty years ago the advisory council on the penal system observed that notions of punitiveness do not accord with â€˜ the british concept of probation as an alternative to , rather than a suspension of , punishment â€™ ( quoted in bochel , 1976 , p. 238 ) .
twenty years later the aec demonstrates that this remains no less true now than it was then .
but does the aec work ?
bringing fossils back to life
in this chapter some of the ways in which palaeontologists determine the way fossil animals lived are described , reanimating the dead fragments to build up a living creature .
since popular ideas of life in the past are often founded on vividly coloured reconstructions of â€˜ the world in the jurassic period â€™ and the like , it is important to remember that these imaginative scenes are all inferences from bones , and similar fragments .
in fact there is nothing fixed about such interpretations , because the way the fossils are understood may change over the years , but it is usually some time before new discoveries percolate into the popular presentations .
even the most solid-looking dinosaurs may have changed their habits in the last few years !
many different lines of evidence may be used to flesh out the bare bones of the fossils .
the first of these is the evidence of the rocks from which the remains were recovered .
the sediments themselves reveal much about the environment of deposition , as was shown in chapter 3 .
it is important to establish whether the fossil animal actually lived in the environment which furnished its sedimentary cover , or whether its remains were swept in from some other place .
fortunately it is usually easy to spot such intruders .
the type of sediment and the associated fossils will show whether the environment was marine , freshwater or terrestrial , providing the basic information into which the ecology of the animal has to be accommodated .
the sediments themselves may have preserved some of the tracks left by the animal ( p. 20 ) to give direct evidence of its past activities .
from the tracks alone it is possible to be certain of the bipedal stance of certain dinosaurs , and to measure their stride .
the character of the rocks , and their setting in the past geography at the time when they accumulated , diagnoses the climatic setting in which the extinct fauna lived , and climate imposes certain restraints on possible modes of life .
savannah animals differ from those of tropical rain forests , and these again from inhabitants of the tundra at high latitudes .
looking at the fossil animal itself , the first necessity is to reconstruct it as accurately as possible from its fragmentary remains .
sometimes this is a very complex business , particularly for vertebrates with numbers of small bones .
to proceed from the reconstruction to an assessment of probable life habits two different but complementary approaches are used .
one method attempts to compare the structures of teeth or limbs or some other feature of the extinct animal with living analogues .
these do not have to be biologically related organisms .
the basic argument is that structures that are closely similar were probably adapted to a similar function .
sometimes these similarities are quite obvious : the ferocious teeth of a predatory dinosaur are a sure indication of hunting habits , with hardly a glance at the fangs of living mammalian carnivores .
but the structure and functioning of grinding or chewing teeth in other mammals , in which opposing teeth co-operate in action , and which can be matched in extinct , unrelated mammals , is a much more subtle matter , involving detailed studies on the operation of living dental systems to help elucidate the functioning of fossil ones .
the technique of â€˜ hunt the analogue â€™ is a favourite one practised by palaeontologists , but it is certainly not a foolproof one , because there are many fossil animals that defy comparison with living organisms , and some analogues do not stand up to detailed scrutiny .
the second method tries to analyse the structure of the fossil almost as if it were a piece of engineering .
if the fossil is constructed in a certain way , then there are only a limited number of â€˜ jobs â€™ that the structure could perform .
the idea here is to decide which of the possibilities is the most likely one .
this assumes that nature only manufactures efficient designs .
for the most part this is a reasonable assumption to make .
most animals today do seem to have bodies that accord well with the functions they have to carry out to survive : flyers are aerodynamically efficient , active swimmers have suitable streamlining , herbivorous mammals have teeth appropriate for grinding plant food , and so on .
ideally one could construct a model of the fossil to test out these various functions in experiments , but the number of examples where the analysis has been pursued this far are limited .
of course it can never be known whether the right answer has been reached ( unless somebody dredges up a â€˜ living fossil â€™ from the depths of the ocean ) â€” there are only varying degrees of probability .
but the best answers are probably obtained where the functional design of the fossil points to the same life habits as a living analogue , and where both are consistent with the geological circumstances in which the fossil remains occur .
swimming trilobites
there are thousands of different kinds of trilobites .
all of them were marine and all of them are extinct .
since many kinds of trilobites co-existed at any one time they were probably occupying different ecological niches , behaving in different ways , corresponding with the wide variation in shape that they show .
we can use the methods described above to elucidate some of these occupations , and get a glimpse , albeit an imperfect one , of the trilobite as it lived .
i will take an example where all the methods can be used , and where all point in the same direction , so that the answer is probably correct .
most trilobites were broadly oval-shaped being rather longer than wide , not greatly convex , and with eyes that occupy perhaps a quarter of the length of the head .
there are a few trilobite species , however , with enormous , globular eyes ( see below ) .
by examining the way these animals were put together it is possible to suggest a likely mode of life .
giant-eyed ordovician trilobite , seen from the top and side .
twice its natural size .
enlargement shows a section through the lenses to show the direction of the field of view .
we can take the eyes first .
the trilobite eye was of a compound type , and each lens was made up of a calcite crystal .
from the optical properties of this mineral we know that the lens was able to interpret light coming from a direction more or less at right-angles to the lens surface .
so we can deduce what the field of vision of our globular-eyed trilobite was , by looking at the directions in which all the lenses face .
it turns out that our animal was able to see in almost every direction â€” upwards , downwards , sideways and forwards , and even backwards , because the eyes bulged out beyond the line of the rest of the body .
most other trilobites have a predominantly lateral field of view .
if the animal lived on the sea bottom , it seems unlikely that it would have eye lenses specialized for looking downwards , and we begin to suspect that the animal habitually dwelt above the sea floor .
other features of its shape are consistent with this .
at theâ€“ edge of the eyes are a pair of long spines , and these point downwards at a steep angle , at very awkward attitude for resting comfortably on the sea floor .
most â€˜ normal â€™ trilobites have a more or less horizontal rim around the forward margin , which may have rested on the sediment surface .
the thorax of the large-eyed trilobite is remarkably long compared with the average trilobite ( compare fig. 33 ) .
the convex , middle part of the thorax contained the musculature that operated the appendages ( which , as usual , are not preserved ) , and the relatively large volume of this region shows that the musculature was powerful .
the construction of this giant-eyed trilobite suggests that it lived an actively swimming life well above the bottom , and possibly in the surface waters of the sea .
of course because there are no living trilobites we can not find direct confirmation of this hypothesis , but we can look for other arthropods that have the same modifications of the eyes , for example , in the present day oceans .
the analogy is found in such ocean-going amphipods ( a kind of â€˜ shrimp â€™ ) as cystosoma , which also has enormously expanded eyes , looking like headlamps , compared with its bottom-dwelling relatives ( see above ) .
in fact many of the arthropods that inhabit the water column have large , globular eyes of this kind .
49 fossil bony fish , lates gracilis , eocene .
this fish is preserved in a fine-grained limestone which preserved most of the skeletal details of the fish ( but not its colours ) .
this is a stout-bodied fish , something like a perch in general proportions , with long , low fins on upper and lower rear of the body ( fin rays finely divide near their ends ) .
head to tail the fish measures 17 cm .
50 vertebra of the jurassic pliosaur , liopleurodon species , kimmeridge , southern england .
this is only one vertebra of an animal much too bulky to appear in a book of this size !
the original porous bone has been consolidated to become much heavier than it would have been in life .
diameter of the vertebra is about 10 cm .
51 fossil frog , rana species , miocene , spain .
this species is preserved in a soft shale , but one which allows for the skeletal anatomy to be preserved in its entirety .
the outline of the soft parts are also clearly displayed , so that the animal has been preserved almost in frozen motion .
frogs are one of the more numerous of amphibian fossils .
specimen 12 cm long .
52 fossil calcareous alga , belonging to the genus coelosphaeridium , ordovician , ringsaker , norway .
these spherical algae are preserved as internal moulds in a mudstone , the original calcite having disappeared .
canals within the algae stand out as rods in this kind of preservation , which is common in ordovician rocks .
there is a central sphere visible on one of the specimens .
related forms are spread over much of the world in ordovician and silurian times .
individual globes have a diameter of 1â½â€“2 cm .
53 fossil lycopod bark , lepidodendron rimosum , carboniferous , newcastle , england .
this is a typical â€˜ coal shale â€™ ; shales and silts occurring between productive coal seams often contain impressions of the plants that went to form the coal .
the plant material itself is converted to black carbon .
this fossil bark is typified by its lozenge-shaped leaf scars arranged in spiral rows .
this fragment is 1o cm long .
54 fossil bark of the lycopod tree , sigillaria laevigata , carboniferous .
this specimen lies on a slab of mudstone , the specimen itself having been converted into coal-like material â€” that is , into carbon .
sigillaria bark is covered with little horseshoe-shaped scars ( leaf cushions ) .
it is found in north america ( canada and the us ) , england , belgium , france , germany and russia .
this piece is 9 cm long .
55 leaves of the enigmatic plant , glossopteris linearis , permian .
many of these long leaves are preserved on the bedding planes of a siltstone .
glossopteris is characterized by its long strap-shaped leaves , which have a conspicuous midrib , with many fine , smaller veins branching off it to form a network .
its classification in relation to other plants is still unsolved .
these leaves have a length of 7â€“8 cm .
56 fossil root , stigmaria ficoides , carboniferous .
this root is preserved as an internal mould , in a tough sandstone .
it has been slightly crushed .
the infilling sandstone is derived from the fossil soil over which the root was growing .
stigmaria is the name given to roots of the giant lycopod lepidodendron ( this page ) .
this specimen is 15 cm long , but roots have been found which attain a length of 14 metres !
57 leaf of a carboniferous seedfern , mariopteris muricata , staffordshire , england .
the specimen is preserved in a hard claystone nodule , which preserved the leaflets in relief .
this is quite a common preservation in coal measures .
microscopical details are not so well-preserved , and the fossil is , of course , only a fragment of a larger plant .
the leaflets are attached to the axis along their entire base .
6 cm long .
58 fossil horsetail , annularia sphenophylloides , carboniferous .
this specimen is preserved as a carbonaceous compression on a very fine-grained and well-bedded sandstone , a preservation common in carboniferous rocks .
the little circlets of flat â€˜ leaves â€™ born at regular intervals on the jointed stems serve to distinguish this plant from others in the carboniferous coal-shales. 8 cm long .
59 a â€˜ prefern â€™ , archaeopteris hibernica , devonian , kilkenny , ireland .
a fern-like plant , beautifully preserved in a yellow sandstone .
the original material of the axis shows up black against the background of the rock .
the large frond carries many branches , on which there are numbers of leaf-like pinnules â€” more or less alternating on either side of the branch .
the specimen is 25 cm long .
60 fossil fern , sphenopteris laurenti , carboniferous , derbyshire , england .
the frond of this fossil fern is preserved as a compression on the surface of a fine-grained , mica-rich siltstone .
some of the original fine detail on the leaflets is preserved .
reproductive structures should really be found to distinguish it from other , superficially fern-like plants .
this frond is 9 cm long .
61 fossil poplar leaf , populus latior , miocene .
the leaf is excellently preserved on the flat bedding-plane of a limestone laid down under fresh water .
poplar leaves have an elegant outline resembling that of an arab minaret .
this species has a finely toothed margin ; a large , wide leaf born on a long stem .
this type of tree has a history extending back to the upper cretaceous .
length of leaf is 18 cm .
62 miocene maple seeds , acer trilobatum .
seeds of the maple family are typically in pairs , joined at the base , with flat â€˜ wings â€™ that help the seeds to disperse .
seeds of acer are rare compared with the leaves , which can be found in rocks dating back to the cretaceous period .
this is from the oeningen , switzerland .
seeds are about 3 cm long .
63 miocene maple leaf , acer trilobatum .
this leaf is exquisitely preserved in a fine-grained , flat-bedded marly limestone .
although much of the fine detail can be seen most of the tissue of the leaf is destroyed .
the leaf is divided into three parts with a broad central lobe ( finely toothed ) and two flanking lobes .
simple , distinct veining can also be seen .
the leaf is 10 cm long .
64 fossil flower , porana oeningensis , miocene .
these beautifully preserved flowers are from the oeningen deposits like the maple leaf and seeds illustrated here .
fossil flowers are extremely rare because of their delicacy and because they are shortlived .
these flowers have five oval petals , finely veined .
no details of the stamens are present in the fossil state .
diameter of the flowers is about 2 cm .
giant-eyed living crustacean ( cystosoma )
if it is correct that our trilobite lived above the sea bottom , actively swimming in the water , there are certain predictions we can make about its geological occurrence which can be tested by looking in the rocks .
most bottom-dwelling trilobites preferred to live at a particular water depth , or on a particular type of sea bottom ( mud , sand or lime ) .
no such restriction should apply to our large-eyed species ; it should be found with all other different kinds of trilobite assemblages without preference .
this has been proved in several places : in some arctic localities it is found with trilobites that lived at great depths in the muds of the ordovician ocean , while in canada the same species occurs mixed with the inhabitants of the shallow-water seas , where limestones were accumulating .
by the same token the free-swimming trilobite may be expected to have a very wide geographical distribution , for oceans would be no barrier to it .
and again this proves to be the case : our example is found in arctic canada , in the high arctic island of spitsbergen , thousands of miles away in what is now the desert country of nevada and utah in the united states , in western ireland , in russia , and in northwestern australia .
so in this case the different sources of evidence all point in the same direction , whether derived from a detailed consideration of the way the trilobite is constructed , or by analogy with living animals with similar adaptations , or from the evidence of the rocks or the distribution of the fossils .
these giant-eyed trilobites of the ordovician were active swimmers in the surface waters , as near certainly as we can ever know .
there are all kinds of different questions we can ask about the life habits of these trilobites , which are not subject to the same kind of careful scrutiny .
what did they eat , for example ?
because we do not have the legs preserved , it is not possible to see how the mouth appendages functioned in feeding , and neither are the stomach contents preserved .
so here there are only more or less likely speculations .
active swimmers in the surface waters of the present oceans are likely to feed directly on the plankton , and the trilobites may have had a method of harvesting large quantities of minute food .
or they may have been hunters after larger prey , in which case when appendages are eventually discovered they may prove to have adaptations for grasping and manipulating larger food .
puzzles remain , even though we can be certain of the rudiments of the story .
controversy among the giant dinosaurs
the giant sauropod dinosaurs like brachiosaurus were the largest land animals the world has seen they weighed more than 80 tonnes and present quite different problems in the interpretation of their life habits from the diminutive trilobites .
such spectacular animals have obviously attracted much attention , and one might suppose that the problem of how they lived would have been satisfactorily solved long ago .
most of the popular books showing the mesozoic giants in their natural setting portray them wallowing about in swamps flanked by deep vegetation , their bodies largely under water .
surely an animal of this bulk , it was argued , must be partly supported by water , and their relatively inconsequential teeth must have been adapted for chewing on the kind of soft , luxuriant vegetation that flourishes in and around swamps .
because their nasal openings were on the top of their heads they could even continue to breathe if it became necessary ( see p. 115 ) to totally submerge .
recently the life habits of the giants have been looked at in a way that disproves most of these traditional notions .
consider the structure of their legs .
the sauropods have relatively long , pillar-like legs , resembling those of the elephant , the largest living land animal , and may have been well adapted for supporting the huge bulk of the animal .
the feet of the sauropod are small ( relatively speaking ! ) , with short , stubby toes , yet animals that walk on soft mud tend to have spreading feet to distribute their weight more evenly .
it is difficult to see how the compact feet of the sauropod could avoid becoming stuck fast in the soft , muddy bottom of a lake .
if the dinosaur did , after all , live on dry land , then the long neck could have usefully functioned to allow the animal to browse the high foliage of trees ( see p. 116 ) .
it has been suggested that an animal of the size of brachiosaurus could not have breathed under water because of the pressure on the lungs .
their fossil remains seem to occur with other animals and plants , which are generally accepted as terrestrial .
there is even some evidence from the tracks they have left behind that diplodocus and its allies moved about in herds .
they may have been the gigantic reptilian analogue of the elephant , and it may be no coincidence that the elephant also has its nasal openings on top of the skull , with the nostrils in this case sited at the end of the trunk it has been suggested that some sauropods may have had a proboscis of some sort .
the balance of evidence seems to be swinging away from the original idea of swamp-dwelling giant dinosaurs to fully terrestrial habits .
but other aspects of the dinosaur living habits are still more strongly debated .
in the last few years a powerful controversy has arisen over whether the dinosaurs as a whole were cold-blooded , like all living reptiles ( and there is no doubt that dinosaurs were reptiles ) , or warm-blooded , resembling mammals in this respect .
cold-blooded animals have to â€˜ warm up â€™ before they can be fully active ; that is why lizards and snakes bask in the sun in temperate climates .
for this reason they can not cope with climates having greatly extended winters .
warm-blooded animals have the same body temperatures at all times , and can be more continuously active , but they use far more energy â€” and hence need more food â€” than cold-blooded animals of the same size .
the posture of many dinosaurs , and particularly the carnivorous theropod dinosaurs , was fully erect with the legs beneath the body , and unlike the sprawling legs of living reptiles ( see p. 116 ) .
the long back legs of such hunters look highly suitable for running , and as they did so the long tail may have been held erect as a kind of counter-balance ( see p. 116 ) .
for any kind of prolonged activity , warm-bloodedness would have been a distinct advantage .
under the microscope even the bone structure of these dinosaurs looks more like that of living mammals than cold-blooded reptiles .
on the other hand it can be argued that the sauropods like brachiosaurus were so large , and with a relatively small surface area through which to cool compared with their enormous volume , that their cooling rate could have been slow enough to allow them to sustain more continuous activity than smaller , living reptiles .
it has also been argued that the small mouths of the giants simply could not have downed enough food to support a warm-blooded metabolism , particularly plant food that needs a lot of processing before it becomes available as energy .
the armoured or plated dinosaurs include some species that seem too heavily burdened with protective armour to have been very active , but this does not necessarily mean that they had to be cold-blooded .
protagonists of the warm-blooded theory will show some of the horned dinosaurs charging over the cretaceous plains like furious reptilian rhinoceroses !
one idea about the life habits of the dinosaur giants , published in joc and colette at the natural history museum in 1935
the warm-blooded supporters tend to ally themselves with the supporters of a theory about the relationships of the dinosaurs .
this is that the dinosaurs , or a close dinosaur relative , included the ancestors of the living birds .
some of the smaller , and most certainly highly active dinosaurs were about the size of a chicken , and there is more than a passing similarity between a running ostrich and the kind of reconstruction that shows fleet-footed , running dinosaurs .
the point is that birds themselves are warm-blooded , like mammals , and if birds and dinosaurs are as closely related as now seems likely , then it obviously increases the likelihood that the dinosaurs themselves may have been warm-blooded .
the pros and cons of this theory are the subject of much contentious debate by experts , but it would probably be correct to say that the greater number of specialists believe that at least the more bipedal of the dinosaurs , including small and large carnivores , were warm-blooded , active animals .
a lot of the argument among the authorities on these animals is about the equivalence or otherwise of certain bones in dinosaurs and bird skeletons ( and particularly the jurassic bird archaeopteryx ) ; this makes for rather dry reading for the layman .
but the end-product is the accurate reconstruction of the jurassic and cretaceous terrestrial world , over which the dinosaurs were indisputably dominant .
action and inaction in the cities
susanne macgregor and ben pimlott
the essays in this book do not amount to a programme : but they are intended to provide a springboard for one .
the aim is to analyse a problem which economic growth alone has failed to cure â€” and to consider possible new forms of public action .
the biggest single difficulty in drawing attention to urban poverty is that it is not new , but simply â€” in some of its most worrying manifestations â€” getting worse .
like the poor themselves , the inner city has long been with us .
ever since the industrial revolution created a mass urban society , the conditions of the poorest city dwellers have given rise to anxiety among the better off .
the inner city has been variously regarded as a cause for moral outrage , a threat to public order , or as a stain on the nation 's conscience .
meanwhile bad housing , bad sanitation , lack of education , and other perennial ills associated with overcrowding and poverty have been routinely denounced by political leaders and social reformers .
a central objective of the post-war welfare state was , indeed , to alleviate the problems of the urban poor , over whom beveridge 's five giants ( want , disease , ignorance , squalor , and idleness ) had for so long held sway .
in the early 1940s and 1950s , the belief was widely held that a combination of government intervention â€” in the form of town planning , housing and health programmes , and the provision of social security â€” and permanent male full employment , together with an increase in real wages , would reduce suffering due to poverty to manageable proportions .
the 1964 labour government was elected on a tide of impatience at the slackening pace of social reform , but also of optimism that little more than economic growth , fuelled by technological change , was needed to remove the main causes of urban deprivation ( macgregor , 1981 ) .
disillusion swiftly followed .
the work of peter townsend and others showed that , far from presiding over the elimination of poverty , the wilson government actually failed to prevent some of its features from worsening ( townsend and bosanquet , 1972 ) .
evidence began to mount that much of the social welfare paternalism of the post-war period had created almost as many problems as it solved .
neither the butler education act of 1944 , nor the introduction of comprehensive schools , prevented a high proportion of children from under-achieving .
post-war reconstruction and housing programmes seemed to do nothing to prevent , and seemed even to encourage , a rise in crime and mental illness .
meanwhile , in many parts of the country , a problem as old as cities themselves â€” tension between cultural groups , between earlier immigrants and newer ones , between black , brown , and white , and ( increasingly ) between large sections of urban youth and the police â€” came to be identified as the key inner-city issue .
rising unemployment turned a lingering and growing malaise into a crisis .
as in the united states , so in britain it was an outbreak of violence that dramatically brought the plight of the inner cities to public notice .
in the early 1980s , at a time when manufacturing industry was collapsing and the outlook for the unskilled looked particularly bleak , frustration boiled over in a series of riots in london , bristol , birmingham , liverpool , and elsewhere .
all were spontaneous outbursts : none , contrary to some claims , were politically inspired or orchestrated ( except in northern ireland where urban problems existed on a grander , more devastating scale , and where there was a unique heritage ) .
many had an â€˜ ethnic â€™ dimension , in the sense that many of the rioters were black .
unlike , however , the 1958 notting hill riots , few of those involved were immigrants â€” the vast majority were british born .
and the disturbances could not strictly be called racial : the most prominent feature was that of violent clashes between young people and the police .
the problems , however , were not confined to violent upheavals of this kind .
paul harrison 's inside the inner city : life under the cutting edge focused on hackney , a london borough ranked among the worst off on any scale of urban deprivation ( harrison , 1983 ) .
harrison describes ( p. 369 ) the way in which the inner urban powder-keg leads to a vicious circle , with many victims , but few individual villains :
the police force face the virtually impossible task of keeping the lid on the explosive mixture of ingredients that the dynamics of british society have assembled in the inner city .
this mixture , heated by recession and high unemployment , inevitably generates a high level of crime .
this necessitates , in turn , a far more numerous and ubiquitous police presence than in other kinds of area , far more frequent unpleasant contact with the public as potential suspects , and far greater opportunities for police misjudgment or abuse .
the inevitable sufferers , of course , are the poor , of whom those who actually commit the offences that concern the police are a tiny minority and whom , indeed , it should be the purpose of the police to protect .
not only are the most disadvantaged on the receiving end of most crime , argues harrison , they also have to put up with the heaviest police presence .
they are more likely to be stopped and searched , and to be the victim of mistaken arrest or conviction .
at the same time , the residents of the poorest areas have to suffer , in a way that is not true of those who live elsewhere , a growing fear of attack on themselves or their property .
improved police methods might help , writes harrison , to contain the problem .
but , without other changes , the result is likely to be a â€˜ society of barricaded self-defence , and a steady erosion of civil liberties â€™ .
and he concludes , â€˜ of all the warnings that the inner city has to offer for the direction british society is taking , this is perhaps the most sinister â€™ .
harrison 's vision of a nightmarish future for inner cities , locked in a cold or hot war between have-nots and the forces of public order , was echoed by robert chesshyre ( 1987 , p. 95 ) , who concluded that by the late 1980s :
the basic social contract , whereby citizens enjoy certain rights â€” including health care , decent education and housing and a job â€” in return for which they observe the rule of law , was breaking down .
as a consequence an underclass was evolving â€” football hooligans , muggers , inner city rioters â€” somewhat more frightening than their dickensian forebears because they were mobile and all too visible .
recently , of course , there has been an added dimension â€” part media-and-politician inflated , part real : drugs .
the spiral in drug abuse and trafficking , with direct consequences for the aids epidemic , has created a new kind of alarm .
the early 1980s witnessed a radical change in patterns of heroin taking , alongside the global increase .
smoking heroin ( â€˜ chasing the dragon â€™ ) was one feature of the upsurge .
another was the increased availability of , and demand for , cocaine .
sensational media and police reports in 1989 seemed to suggest an increased use of â€˜ crack â€™ among young people in parts of south london , liverpool , and birmingham â€” with attendant fears that this particularly dangerous substance might become widespread , as it was reported to be in parts of the united states .
for the moment , however , the pattern of drug abuse in britain remains as varied as ever â€” with home-produced drugs such as amphetamines as serious a problem as those that hit the headlines .
it is a symptom of public anxiety about urban squalor â€” and , less creditably , of class and racial prejudice â€” that â€˜ drugs â€™ and â€˜ inner cities â€™ are automatically linked in the popular consciousness ( macgregor , 1989a ) .
nevertheless , drug-taking and more particularly the disruptive social consequences of addiction , are especially serious in areas of city poverty ( burr , 1989 ) .
in short , if life was always harder in the inner cities than elsewhere , and if conditions may temporarily have been alleviated by the impact of the welfare state and rising incomes , the last decade has been widely represented as a period of deterioration .
moreover , few would dispute that this apparent decline is a reality : the first words of the prime minister herself , after the result of the 1987 election was known , were an acknowledgement of the challenge posed to government by the â€˜ inner cities â€™ .
what has been lacking however â€” as well as the political will to do something â€” has been any shared agreement on the cause .
can the problems of urban poverty be blamed on individual pathology ?
on feckless parents and grandparents ?
or on the social or physical environment â€” the replacement of companionably unhygienic slums by soulless tower blocks with broken lifts ( coleman et al . ,
1985 ) ?
or would a simple injection of resources transform kafkaesque honeycombs into happy living-spaces , with a consequent decline in inner-city ills ?
â€˜ a duke can live comfortably in a castle , after all â€™ , the architect cedric price is quoted as saying .
â€˜ you and i would die of frostbite .
same building â€” just a matter of money and management â€™ ( parkin , 1989 ) .
the view that only â€˜ outstanding management â€™ could meet the problem was held by the audit commission ( 1987 ) .
the picture painted by the commission 's report on inner london is as gruesome as any ever presented ( and is itself revealing of common prejudices in its choice of indicators of deprivation ) :
in some london boroughs , unemployment among young men exceeds 45% ; in some places , among young blacks , it exceeds 60% .
more than one child in three is born into a single parent family .
half the school leavers have no o levels or their cse equivalents .
homelessness , housing conditions , crime are worsening year by year , as the cycle of urban deprivation becomes more established ( p. 1 )
drawing on north american experience , the commission concluded that â€˜ poor management was an important contributory factor to new york 's problems â€™ , and sought to apply the same lessons here ( p. 2 ) .
the government 's post-1987 initiatives have , to some extent , reflected a diagnosis based on the need for better management â€” though on the principle that central authorities can provide a firmer grip than local ones â€” but combined with an anti-collectivist belief in the restorative powers of capitalism .
leech and amin ( 1988 , p. 14 ) summarize this approach , not unfairly , in the following terms :
the encouragement of private investment and the liberation of the market ; the containment of the forces of social discontent ; the control of the powers of the local authorities ; and the encouragement of the movement of the wealthy into the inner city thus creating buffer areas of tory support , accentuating inequalities and injustice and ( hopefully though not necessarily ) reducing the potential for conflict among the urban poor .
the main thrust of the government 's policy is contained in the january 1988 white paper on regional policy and the enterprise economy , in the new employment training programme , and especially in the march 1988 action for cities programme â€” all resting on wider reforms to local government structure and finance , and to education and housing .
the most striking feature of this package , apart from its aim actively to involve employers and entrepreneurs , is a sharp reduction in the role of local government .
despite the contemporary tone of much of action for cities , the programme 's heritage can be traced to the early 1960s studies which provided the basis for the 1965 milnerâ€“holland report on housing and the 1967 plowden report on education , as a result of which general improvement areas and education priority areas were established .
the 1970s â€˜ urban programme â€™ had a social , rather than economic , emphasis and was administered by the home office .
it was initiated partly in response to the furore caused by enoch powell 's 1969 â€˜ rivers of blood â€™ speech , much as disturbances at the 1976 notting hill carnival prompted further steps on the part of the department of the environment â€” â€˜ a riot makes a much bigger impact on government thinking â€™ , as donnison ( 1987 ) has pointed out , â€˜ than any amount of earnest and accurate research â€™ .
the urban programme consisted of grants and initiatives under the 1969 local government grants ( social need ) act , which was intended as a flexible instrument to provide supplementary help to local authorities in the fields of housing , education , and health .
originally , the programme supplemented existing central and local government schemes designed to meet special needs in urban areas .
the scope was extended in an â€˜ enhanced â€™ urban programme , which included economic and environmental as well as social projects , and was specifically directed at the inner urban areas where the problems were most severe .
earlier , the change of emphasis from a â€˜ social â€™ to an â€˜ economic and environmental â€™ focus had been reflected in a switch of responsibility for the programme from the home office to the department of the environment .
the â€˜ enhanced programme resulted from the 1978 inner urban areas act , based on a white paper , published the previous year , on policy for the inner cities ( doe , 1977 ) , the first comprehensive policy statement on the subject to acknowledge it as a definable and cohesive problem .
the white paper drew on studies conducted earlier in the decade in liverpool , birmingham , and london which pointed to a debilitating flight of capital and skilled labour from the critical areas of deprivation .
a key aspect of the 1977 white paper was the stress it placed on the wider effects of poverty : that it was not just those with acute needs who suffered .
it argued that in talking about inner cities it was vital to think in terms not just of individuals , but of society ; that the multiple deprivations of the worst hit areas affected all the residents ; that the consequences included a pervasive sense of neglect and decay , a decline in community spirit , a low standard of neighbourhood facilities , and an increase in crime and vandalism ; and that , without government intervention , the future was one of reduced job opportunities , deteriorating housing , and a decline in public services .
the document , and the legislation that derived from it , pointed to a positively discriminatory approach : with both central and local government supplementing existing programmes in such a way as to strengthen local economies , as well as the physical and social environment .
such measures constituted the present government 's heritage , when it took office in 1979 .
none of them , of course , anticipated the scale of the problems which were caused by the slump and collapse of much of what remained of inner urban manufacturing industry in the early 1980s .
neither , at first , did the incoming administration foresee the impact of rising unemployment , which was to be especially serious among the urban young .
true , the new secretary of state for the environment laid stress , from the outset , on the need for economic regeneration , and indicated his sympathy for the voluntary sector in the tackling of urban problems .
the previous government , however , had already pointed to the need to revitalize urban economies , and at first the shift was more rhetorical than real .
michael heseltine ( 1987 , p. 138 ) has since claimed that â€˜ we set a new objective : to make the inner cities places where people would want to live and work and where the private investor would be willing to put his money â€™ .
partnership became his slogan â€” the partnership of public and private brains and money .
a new urban development grant was devised , to pump-prime with public funds schemes which would then attract private investment .
heseltine 's vision was of â€˜ partnerships which recognise that there are some things that only governments can pay for , but also that the ingenuity and flexibility of the private sector is indispensable â€™ ( p. 156 ) .
he claims that serious work on inner-city policy began in 1979 : but it was , undoubtedly , the riots of 1981 , coinciding with the biggest drop in employment and job vacancies since the war , which gave impetus to the new approach .
urban development corporations were introduced in 1981 in london docklands and merseyside , and the urban development grant came in late the following year .
conservative instincts were , of course , to minimize â€” within the â€˜ partnership â€” state involvement and expenditure , relative to that of private enterprise .
yet , the irony of the early 1980s â€” as a deteriorating , but perennial , urban problem rapidly became the most acute aspect of the crisis of mass unemployment â€” was that a tory government , willy-nilly , found itself presiding over an increase in state intervention through a variety of agencies .
the increased scale of operations also ushered in another fashion of the 1980s â€” new management structures .
thus in 1985 city action> teams were introduced to each â€˜ inner city partnership â€™ area to co-ordinate the work of the three government departments involved .
task forces , meanwhile , were directed to tackle youth unemployment .
by 1986/7 the urban programme was supporting 1,380 starter units and 400 business starts in enterprise workshops .
it was providing 27,500 training places ( often in conjunction with the manpower services commission ) : some 2,500 buildings were being improved ; estate action aimed to tackle run down housing ; and a large number of new â€˜ partnerships â€™ ( which some might see as subsidies , or discredited regional grants , in a new guise ) were in operation , in an effort to bring private investment to run-down urban areas .
by 1988 it was claimed that â£200 million of urban development grant and urban regeneration grant had successfully â€˜ levered â€™ more than â£800 million of private investment into the inner cities ( although how much of the latter sum might have been invested in any case is difficult to say ) .
meanwhile , there were other incentive schemes â€” enterprise zones , for example , and simplified planning zones , which aimed to lift tax and planning â€˜ barriers â€™ in order to facilitate investment .
indeed , while with one hand trying to hold down expenditure by local authorities , the government found itself by the late 1980s involved with the other hand in massive ear-marked spending on inner urban areas .
the department of the environment alone by 1988 was spending half a billion pounds out of an action for cities total , involving most home departments , estimated at â£3 billion .
perhaps a labour government would have spent even more : it would certainly have spent it in different ways .
it is a curious comment on thatcherism , however , that the administration most committed to a reduction in the role of the state , and in the need for an independent private sector , has spent more on specific urban regeneration and employment schemes and incentives to private investment in urban areas than any other in recent history .
one of the most bizarre aspects of government policy has been the effective murder of the voluntary sector , and its appropriation , by subterfuge , into the tory version of the corporate state .
conservatives have always lauded the â€˜ voluntarist â€™ principle in welfare , and encouraged it from platforms .
faced , however , with the catastrophic increase in unemployment and the need to occupy large numbers of workless people without directly employing them ( which would have run counter to the economic doctrine which had led to the redundancy of many of them in the first place ) , the government poured money into any â€˜ voluntary â€™ agency willing to put in a bid for government-funded cheap labour .
one result was the triumphant expansion of some charitable organizations , which rejoiced both at their new-found importance and at the government 's munificence .
another was the transformation of many such bodies , already heavily subsidized from public funds , into de facto agencies of the state , which financed them and indirectly determined their policy .
nowhere was the impact of this clumsy sleight of hand more evident than in the inner cities , where voluntary organizations had been most active , and where the government was most anxious for them to mop up unemployment .
however , the later withdrawal of government support , with the scrapping of the community programme as unemployment receded , left many of these voluntary organizations high and dry .
the national council for voluntary organizations ( ncvo ) has suggested from a recent survey that around 3,000 projects had been affected and had lost â£285 million in funding ( macgregor , 1990 ) .
there was , of course , a crucial element in the government 's anxiety : the high concentration of ethnic minorities in the areas of concern .
in 1981 nearly 40 per cent of ethnic minorities in the uk lived in â€˜ partnership â€™ or â€˜ programme â€™ areas .
there is a danger in reading back from this figure another stereotype , similar to the pavlovian â€˜ drug addiction/inner city â€™ assumed link .
some urban areas have serious problems without a major ethnic dimension ( newcastle , teesside ) ; not all members of ethnic minorities are poor or deprived .
nevertheless , the high proportion of inner urban populations composed of people from ethnic minorities , and the high incidence among these groups of all the indices of poverty and social and environmental hardship â€” combined with the specific problem of inter-racial rivalry , harassment , and tension â€” make race and ethnicity an aspect that is central to any analysis of the inner cities and of any ameliorative approach .
making sense of the 1981 riots
reactions to the riots have concentrated on a number of key variables that are said to characterize the localities in which the riots have occurred .
lord scarman 's report on the 1981 disorders highlighted the importance of unemployment , urban deprivation , racial disadvantage , relations between young blacks and the police , the decline of civic consent , and political exclusion as the key issues .
other reactions have concentrated on the issue of the interplay between inner-city decay and racial disadvantage in contemporary britain .
yet others have argued that the unrest can be seen as a symptom of the breakdown of law and order in british society ( gaffney , 1987 ; hall , 1987 ; keith , 1987 ) .
the main issues that were prominent in debates during 1980â€“1 were â€˜ race â€™ and â€˜ law and order â€™ .
this was by no means an accident , since throughout the 1970s a powerful body of media , political , and academic opinion had been constructed around the theme of how britain was drifting into a â€˜ violent society â€™ , and how the basis of consent was being shifted by the pressures of immigration and the growth of multi-racial inner city areas .
a glimpse of the impact of the 1980â€“1 riots at this level can be achieved through two important debates in parliament .
the first took place in the midst of the july 1981 riots , and had as its theme : â€˜ civil disturbances â€™ .
the tone of the debate was set by home secretary william whitelaw 's introductory statement in which he spoke of ( a ) the need to â€˜ remove the scourge of criminal violence from our streets â€™ , and ( b ) the urgency of developing â€˜ policies designed to promote the mutual tolerance and understanding upon which the whole future of a free democratic society depends â€™ ( hansard , vol. 8 , 16 july 1981 : col. 1405 ) .
the â€˜ scourge of criminal violence â€™ was , whitelaw argued , a danger to the whole framework of consent and legality on which the political institutions of british society were based .
in reply roy hattersley supported the call for the immediate suppression of street violence , but warned that the roots of such riots could not be dealt with until all people felt they had a stake in british society ( ibid. : cols. 1407â€“9 )
the second debate took place on 26 november 1981 , on the publication of the scarman report , and had as its theme : â€˜ law and order â€™ .
the importance of the riots in pushing the law and order issue , and specifically policing , on to the main political agenda was emphasized by the liberal leader , david steel , who argued that â€˜ urgent action â€™ to prevent a drift into lawlessness was necessary from both a moral and a political perspective ( hansard , vol. 13 , 26 november 1981 : cols. 1009â€“11 ) .
a subsequent debate on the same issue in march 1982 was also full of references to the experience of 1981 , the impact of street violence , crime , decaying urban conditions , the breakdown of consent between the police and many local communities , and the spectre of â€˜ more violence to come â€™ if changes in both policing tactics and social policy were not swiftly introduced ( hansard , vol. 20 , 25 march 1982 : cols. 1107â€“81 ) .
the need to support the police was accepted by both the labour and the conservative speakers in the parliamentary debate on the riots , and was established as a benchmark for the official response to the riots long before the scarman report was published in november 1981 .
any substantive disagreement centred around the issue of what role social deprivation and unemployment had in bringing young people to protest violently on the streets .
intermingled with the discourses about race and law and order were constant references to unemployment , particularly among the young , and various forms of social disadvantage and poverty ( solomos , 1988 , pp. 186â€“911 ) .
throughout 1980 and 1981 debates about the riots in the media , in parliament , and in various official reports hinged around the interrelationship between racial , law-and-order , and social factors .
the importance of this debate can be explained , partly , by the political capital which the opposition could make from linking the social and economic malaise of the country at large with violent street disturbances .
conversely , throughout this period government ministers strenuously denied that unemployment and social deprivation were significant causes of urban unrest .
although the scarman report is often taken to be the central text which argues for a link between â€˜ social conditions â€™ and â€˜ disorder â€™ , the terms of the debate were by no means set by scarman .
during both april and july 1981 vigorous exchanges took place in the press and in parliament about the role that deteriorating social conditions and unemployment may have played in bringing about the riots .
during the 16 july parliamentary debate on â€˜ civil disturbances â€™ , roy hattersley 's formulation of this linkage provided a useful summary of the â€˜ social conditions â€™ argument .
after some preliminary remarks about the labour party 's support for the police , he went on to outline his opposition to the view of the riots as essentially anti-police outbursts :
i repeat that l do not believe that the principal cause of last week 's riots was the conduct of the police .
it was the conditions of deprivation and despair in the decaying areas of our old cities â€” areas in which the brixton and toxteth riots took place , and areas from which the skinhead invaders of southall come .
( hansard , vol. 8 , 16 july 1981 : col. 1408 )
much of the subsequent controversy about this analysis centred on the question of youth unemployment .
hattersley had suggested that the riots were a â€˜ direct product â€™ of high levels of youth unemployment , and a furious debate ensued in both parliament and the media about this assertion .
the final symbolic cue used to make sense of the 1980â€“1 protests is more difficult to categorize , but its basic meaning can be captured by the term â€˜ political marginality â€™ .
while a number of discussions of the roots of urban unrest in the united states have noted the salience of political marginality in determining participation in violent protests ( skolnick , 1969 ; fogelson , 1971 ; edelman , 1971 ; knopf , 1975 ) , this issue has received relatively little attention in britain .
nevertheless , during the 1980â€“1 events and their aftermath the political context was discussed from a number of perspectives .
the scarman report , for example , located part of the explanation for the riots in the feelings of alienation and powerlessness which were experienced by young blacks living in depressed inner-city areas .
a successful policy for tackling the roots of urban disorder was seen as one which sought to involve all the community in dealing with the problems of each area so that they could come to feel that they have a stake in its future ( scarman , 1981 , para. 6.42 ) .
where such arguments did not fit in with the overarching themes of race , violence and disorder , and social deprivation they were either sidelined or pushed into the sub-clauses of official reports .
the scarman report , for example , contained the following policy proposal : â€˜ i recommend that local communities must be fully and effectively involved in planning , in the provision of local services , and in the management and financing of specific projects , ( scarman , 1981 , para. 8.44 ) .
such a move towards greater political integration was seen by lord scarman as essential if the gap between inner-city residents and the forces of law and order was to be bridged .
but the concern with overcoming political marginality remained on the sidelines of the main public debate because it questioned the perception of the rioters as driven by irrational , uncivilized , and criminal instincts .
this did not , however , stop the question of political marginality and the need to reform existing policies from being raised at all , as can be seen subsequently by the attempts after 1981 to introduce both locally and nationally measures which were meant to address some of the grievances of the rioters and to ensure that further disturbances did not occur .
aspects of these measures are considered further on in the chapter .
perspectives on the 1985 riots
despite widespread predictions of further unrest in the aftermath of 1981 , the scale and the location of the 1985 riots seem to have surprised even some of the most astute commentators .
handsworth , for example , was presented even shortly before september 1985 as a â€˜ success story â€™ in terms of police â€” community relations .
the outbreak of violence in this area was therefore widely presented as an aberration .
similarly the spread of violence in london to areas such as the broadwater farm estate in tottenham was seen as a break from previous experience , which had centred on areas such as brixton .
there are many continuities between 1980â€“1 and 1985 in relation to the common-sense images used in the press and television to cover the events .
but responses in 1985 were different , at least in terms of degree , and probably in relation to the extent to which the riots were seen as a â€˜ race â€™ phenomenon by a wider body of opinion .
the ambiguities and sub-clauses to be found in much of the press coverage during 1980â€“1 had at least acted as a countervailing tendency against the more extreme forms of discourse which blamed the riots completely on black people .
during the 1985 riots and their immediate aftermath , the imagery of â€˜ race â€™ was used by sections of the press without the sense of ambiguity which could still be found in 1980â€“1 .
the â€˜ silence over race â€™ was breached in 1980â€“1 , but in 1985 debate about racial issues was taken a step further .
peregrine worsthorne , for example , used the ferocity of the confrontations in handsworth , brixton , and tottenham to argue that there was a major question mark over the possibility of assimilating the â€˜ coloured population â€™ into mainstream â€˜ british values â€™ ( sunday telegraph , 29 september 1985 ) .
to be sure there was still a strong response opposing enoch powell 's call for repatriation , from all shades of political opinion , but the racialization of public debate about the 1985 riots went much further than 1980â€“1 .
in this context it was the externality of british afro-caribbeans and asians which was highlighted rather the racist institutions and processes which worked against blacks at all levels of society .
the usage of â€˜ race â€™ during the september-october 1985 period took on new meanings , which had little if anything to do with the impact of racism as such , since the emphasis was on the cultural characteristics of the minority communities themselves .
after handsworth part of the press response was to blame the riot on rivalry between west indians and asians , and even after the arguments were criticized by local residents ; and community leaders , they were used to â€˜ explain â€™ ' what happened .
in addition , the question whether the cultures and values of the black communities , their family structures , and their political attitudes â€˜ bred violence â€™ was constantly raised ( van dijk , 1988 ) .
the actual facts ' of who was arrested during the riots , whether black or white , were hardly debated since it was assumed that they were mostly black and mostly unemployed and involved with crime ( keith , 1987 ) .
the imagery of the â€˜ black bomber , used in handsworth was extended to the notion that there were groups of alienated and criminalized young blacks who saw the riots as a chance to engage in an â€˜ orgy of looting â€™ .
the dear report on handsworth captures this image and links it to the social condition of young blacks :
the majority of rioters who took part in these unhappy events were young , black and afro-caribbean origin .
let there be no doubt , these young criminals are not in any way representative of the vast majority of the afro-caribbean community whose life has contributed to the life and culture of the west midlands over many years and whose hopes and aspirations are at one with those of every other law-abiding citizen .
we share a common sorrow .
it is the duty of us all to ensure that an entire cultural group is not tainted by the actions of a criminal minority .
( dear , 1985 , p. 69 )
this â€˜ black â€™ criminal minority was constructed not only into the leading force behind the riots , but sometimes as the only force .
indeed , throughout september and october 1985 , and during the following months , the imagery of race continued to dominate debate about both the causes and the policy outcomes of the riots .
as pointed out earlier , the â€˜ social causes â€™ argument was another major plank of public debate about the 1980â€“1 riots , particularly in relation to the highly politicized issue of unemployment .
during 1985 this issue was raised once again , though by then the extent of mass unemployment and urban de-industrialization and decay was more stark than it had been in 198l .
images of â€˜ urban decay â€™ , â€˜ tinderbox cities â€™ , and â€˜ ghetto streets â€™ linked up with the images of â€˜ race inequality â€™ and â€˜ black ghettos â€™ to produce an analysis more complex but also more contradictory .
an interesting mixture of the various images was provided by a story in the daily telegraph under the headline : â€˜ broadwater farm : like the divis flats with reggae â€™ ( 8 october 1985 ) .
the mirror described the estate as â€˜ living hell â€™ , and quoted one resident as saying that â€˜ you 'm_ve no idea how awful daily life is â€™ ( 8 october 1985 ) .
such images were reworkings of arguments already used about toxteth in 1981 and brixton in 1981 , but they were used more widely than in 1980â€“1 .
even the daily mail , which deployed the clearest use of â€˜ race â€™ and â€˜ outside agitator â€™ arguments , ran a major story on broadwater farm under the headline : â€˜ burnt-out hulks litter this concrete jungle â€¦ despair hangs heavy â€™ ( 8 october 1985 ) .
a number of stories using such imagery were run by both the quality and the popular press during this period , but similar arguments are to be found in parliamentary debates ( hansard , vol. 84 , 21 october 1985 , cols. 30-.46 , 388 ) , and even in official reports produced by the police on the riots in birmingham and london .
the â€˜ cities of inner despair â€™ were conceived as the breeding ground for disorderly protest , and however hard the government tried to break the causal link between the two , it was forced to take on board the need to restore order not only through the police but through promises of help for the inner cities .
much as in 1980â€“1 , the â€˜ social causes â€™ argument can not be seen separately from the broader debate about the future of the british economy and society .
the government 's record on unemployment was a heavily politicized issue , and just as in 1981 it vehemently denied any responsibility for the riots through its pursuit of free-market policies .
but the government did find a way of accepting a link between the riots and social problems without bringing its main policies into the debate : namely by linking the growth of violent disorder to crime and drugs .
the emphasis on â€˜ crime â€™ and the â€˜ criminal acts â€™ of the rioters in the official responses to the 1985 riots took a general and a specific form .
the general form relied on the argument that the riots were not a form of protest against the insufferable social conditions of inner-city areas or the actions of the police , but a â€˜ criminal act â€™ or a â€˜ cry for loot â€™ .
this was an argument put most succinctly by geoffrey dear , chief constable of the west midlands ( dear , 1985 ) and by douglas hurd , the home secretary , in relation to handsworth .
but it recurred as a theme in official and press responses to the other riots .
the specific form was built upon the notion that the outbreak of violence in handsworth and brixton , in particular , was brought about by â€˜ drug barons â€™ who saw the police attempting to curb their activities and control â€˜ their territory â€™ .
numerous examples of this line of argument can be found in dear 's report on handsworth , and in press coverage during the riots .
taking the specific argument about the role of drugs and â€˜ drug barons â€™ in stimulating the riots , this seems to have served two purposes .
first , it distanced the riots from the social , economic , political , and other grievances which had been linked to them by locating the cause outside the â€˜ social problems â€™ of inner-city dwellers and in the â€˜ simple greed â€™ of the drug barons to accumulate â€˜ loot â€™ .
second , just as dear 's image of a few hundred â€˜ young black criminals â€™ was used to explain what happened in handsworth , the problem of drugs was used to explain what happened at a national level .
the issue of drugs provided an everyday image , already a national issue through saturation media coverage and public debate , around which the police , the home office , and other institutions could depoliticize the riots .
responding to the handsworth events douglas hurd was moved to argue forcibly that such events were senseless and reflected more on those who participated in them than on the society in which they took place : â€˜ the sound which law abiding people in handsworth heard on monday night , the echoes of which i picked up on tuesday , was not a cry for help but a cry for loot â€™ ( financial times , 13 september 1985 ) .
the chief constable for the west midlands , geoffrey dear , took this argument further by pointing out that the day before the riots a successful carnival had taken place , with the support of local community leaders .
he drew the conclusion from this that the riot â€˜ came like a bolt out of the blue â€™ ( guardian , 21 november 1985 ) .
such language focused attention on the individuals or groups who were â€˜ breaking the law â€™ , â€˜ committing criminal acts â€™ , and threatening the interests of the law-abiding â€˜ majority â€™ .
potential applications
overview
ian masser
given the extent to which geographic information management is applications driven , it is important to consider in some depth the characteristics of some potential application fields .
in the process it will be necessary to examine not only the extent to which geographic issues feature on the policy issues agenda in these fields but also the institutional context which governs decision-making and the extent to which data are available for research and policy analysis purposes .
questions on data availability are likely to be particularly important where users are heavily dependent on secondary sources .
in situations of this kind provisions governing access and format may exert powerful constraints on the use that can be made of these data .
the first four chapters in this part examine issues relating to geographic information handling in terms of four potential applications fields .
the authors were asked to review the current state of the art in their fields with particular reference to the likely requirements of the future policy issues agenda in terms of the demands that they make on geographic information management .
authors were also asked to evaluate critically the state of geographic information provision in terms of the needs of users and to consider the impact of user requirements on the development of geographic information handling methodology .
in this way the chapters in this part present a number of perspectives which essentially complement and amplify the discussion in the previous part .
in this case , however , methodological issues are tackled from a largely user standpoint , whereas in the previous part they were viewed as substantive problems in their own right .
in effect the product of the discussion in both parts is a matrix where the methodological issues are listed along one axis and particular applications fields on the other .
figure 8.1 summarizes the main features of this matrix .
there are important differences between the chapters in this part both in the nature of the demands that they make on geographic information and also in the relative importance that is attached to geographic criteria as against other issues by planners and decision-makers in these fields .
the first three chapters dealing with environmental monitoring , natural and technological hazards and settlements and infrastructure applications make use of a very wide range of geographic information .
a major feature of these applications is the extent to which they involve overlays of a variety of information drawn from different sources on a topographic map base .
for this reason they make particularly heavy demands on current gis technology both because of the size of the data sets and the diversity of the data structures that are involved .
brown 's chapter on geodemographics discusses an application field where primary data collected for operational purposes are typically evaluated in relation to secondary data derived from sources such as the census of population .
the range of data sets involved and the demands that are made on gis technology in applications of this kind are often more limited than those of previous applications fields .
however , this is offset by the demands that are made on spatial analysis and modelling methodology .
rhind 's chapter on environmental monitoring and prediction discusses the role of geographic information management in promoting sustainable development on a global scale in the context of the issues identified in the brundtland report .
it points to the impact that the findings of global environmental research are likely to have on most sectors of the uk economy .
this contribution also indicates the wide variety of groups that are involved in monitoring environmental change and draws attention to the role that the european community is increasingly playing in co-ordinating these efforts .
one of the examples of work in progress discusses research that has been carried out for the european commission as part of the corine project .
this highlights the challenges for research in a field categorized by a lack of data for some countries , varying definitions and standards in use , and unreasonably high user expectations .
the chapter as a whole draws attention to a number of key methodological issues that are involved in environmental monitoring and prediction .
these include the highly specialized nature of much of the technical analysis , the limited capacity for checking the accuracy of many of the findings of this kind of research and the consequent need for the development of knowledge-based inference machines for extracting useful information from secondary and often proxy data .
in chapter 10 gatrell and vincent consider a wide range of natural and technological hazards including industrial hazards , risk assessment , hazardous waste disposal , emergency planning , natural hazards and environmental epidemiology .
the substantive content of much of this research straddles the social , environmental and mathematical sciences .
to model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas generated by a chemical explosion and its impact on the surrounding area , for example , an understanding of atmospheric dispersion models , epidemiology and population distribution would be required .
in applications of this kind the authors argue that geographic information management in general and gis in particular have an important role to play and they give a number of examples from research in progress to illustrate the current state of the art in this field .
the discussion of operational problems and prospects further amplifies many of the issues raised in preceding chapters , particularly with respect to the problems caused by the dependency on secondary data sources and the need for much more detailed geographic information to overcome some of the problems associated with linking data sets .
like most of the other contributors to this section , gatrell and vincent see decision support systems as a major area for future development in the geographic information management field .
given that â€˜ most gis are rather dumb systems , requiring intelligent , very computer literate users â€™ , managing natural and technological hazards means that this knowledge base must be built into the system so that it can be utilized quickly by untrained users after a disaster has taken place or in an emergency .
the settlement and infrastructure field is also characterized by a wide range of users with a great diversity of interests .
these include not only central and local government but also major utility companies and transport suppliers .
according to shepherd these users share a common need for up-to-date information on the amount , capacity and condition of urban land , transport networks , utilities , hospitals , schools and other major communal facilities .
in addition to these data requirements , such users are also interested in developing their capabilities for modelling the changing relationships between the supply and demand for infrastructure in the context of both public and private sector decision-making .
shepherd , more than any other contributor to this section , draws attention to the extent to which current efforts in the geographic information management field are constrained by the highly fragmented nature of both data suppliers and users both in sectoral and spatial terms , the great diversity of data sets in varying formats and the difficulties presented by institutional factors such as copyright provision , data ownership and the control of access to data .
digital data occupy a central position in this applications field and a number of examples are given to illustrate the extent to which their development has been hampered or facilitated in various countries by the policies of the organizations with responsibility for digital data provision .
in chapter 12 brown reviews the development of geodemographics from its origins in the computer-based social area analysis of us census tract data from 1950 onwards .
he describes the features of the four main systems that are currently in use in the uk and illustrates their application with reference to examples drawn from retail analysis and store location , market research , credit rating and target marketing .
brown demonstrates the extent to which the growth of research activities in this field has led to the emergence of improved cluster analytic methods for the multidimensional classification of people according to the type of area in which they live .
in the last part of this contribution , brown identifies a number of priorities for future research .
like gatrell and vincent and shepherd before him , he is concerned with the lack of detailed geographical information particularly in this case with reference to the years between censuses .
spatial linkages also feature prominently in brown 's discussion which amplifies many of the points made in the earlier contribution from openshaw in chapter 3 .
the analysis points to the need for the development of a fuzzy geodemographics methodology which takes account of the effects of different types of spatial errors .
other major research priorities for the future in this applications field are the development of response-modelling techniques to explore the factors affecting consumer choice .
this is particularly important in a field where many of the demands made by users are highly specialized in nature .
in summary , then , as fig. 8.1 shows , many of the issues raised by this review of geographic information handling in the four potential application fields are essentially complementary to those discussed in the part on methodological developments .
spatial analysis features particularly prominent on the research agenda relating to natural and technological hazards and geodemographics .
questions relating to data integration emerge as being particularly critical in terms of environmental monitoring and settlement and infrastructure applications .
spatial linkages and questions relating to spatial representation feature prominently in the settlements and infrastructure and geodemographics fields .
the evaluation of error propagation is a matter of considerable significance in the environmental monitoring and settlements and infrastructure fields .
finally , in all applications fields , the findings of the reviews above suggest that there is a need for improvements in user interfaces of all kinds .
this is particularly evident in the demand for the development of knowledge-based decision support systems and modelling capabilities .
such demands highlight the extent to which geographic information management must be regarded as a means to an end rather than an end in itself when viewed from the standpoints of the needs of planners and decision-makers .
the final chapter in this section rounds off the discussion of applications-related research with an examination of organizational issues that need to be taken account of in handling geographic information .
campbell presents a conceptual framework for the analysis of the organizational issues involved in the development and implementation of gis .
this contribution cuts across many of the questions relating to particular applications that were raised in preceding chapters and draws attention to the dangers of neglecting institutional and personal considerations in practice .
all too often , as the experience of many mature applications indicates , technical and data-related matters dominate the system development phase and technically elegant solutions are devised which fail to take enough account of user needs and capabilities .
campbell discusses the role of geographic information in organizations and the process of gis diffusion drawing upon research from a variety of social science disciplines .
the findings of the analysis are summarized in two sets of research questions for all applications fields .
in this way she sets out a research agenda for applications-related research which serves a similar function to the spatial analysis research agenda set out by openshaw at the beginning of part two .
environmental monitoring and prediction
david rhind
introduction
monitoring of the state of and the changes in the environment is now universally recognized as being of profound importance to mankind ( tickell 1986 , 1989 ) .
this awareness is most obviously manifested by the frequent appearance of press reports on ozone depletion , on the greenhouse effect and possible global warming , on nitrate pollution , on deforestation in the tropics , on decreasing biological diversity and on many other environmentally related topics .
usually these reports concentrate on prophecies of a forthcoming armageddon but many also describe a dire contemporary situation .
thus the algal bloom off the italian adriatic shore in 1989 is reckoned to have caused the holiday trade and local fisherman losses running into tens if not hundreds of millions of pounds .
more globally , the brundtland report ( wced 1987 ) noted that , in the 900 days during which the world commission was at work ,
1 .
the african drought put the lives of 35 million people at risk and may have killed 1 million of them ;
2 .
the bhopal accident killed 2000 and injured 200 000 more ;
3 .
the chernobyl disaster caused environmental damage across europe ;
4 .
a chemical fire in switzerland caused toxic materials to be transported by the rhine at least as far as the netherlands ;
5 .
at least 60 million people died of diarrhoeal diseases caused by malnutrition and dirty water .
as a consequence of these and other disasters , of rapid and world-wide broadcasting of them and of the concerned action of many individuals , the environment is now â€˜ moving fast up the political agenda â€™ ( patten 1989 ) .
the then prime minister also emphasized the political awakening to the environment in statements such as : â€˜ it is possible that with all these enormous changes ( population , agricultural , use of fossil fuels ) concentrated into such a short period of time , we have unwittingly begun a massive experiment with the system of this planet itself â€™ ( thatcher 1988 ) .
the political concern is not altruistic .
mrs thatcher , a recent convert to environmental conservation , clearly held the opinion that environmental problems are not only soluble but that solving them can be shown to be cost-effective :
in the past when we identified forms of pollution , we have shown our capacity to act effectively .
the great london smogs are now only a nightmare of the past .
we have cut airborne lead by 50 per cent .
we are spending â£4 billion on cleansing the mersey basin alone , and the thames now has the cleanest metropolitan estuary in the world .
even though this kind of action may cost a lot , i believe it to be money well and necessarily spent because the health of our economy and the health of our environment are totally dependent upon each other â€¦ .
the government espouses the concept of sustainable economic development .
stable prosperity can be achieved throughout the world provided the environment is nurtured and safeguarded ( thatcher 1988 ) .
the primary official manifestation of this uk commitment to the environment has been the government 's white paper ( hmso 1990 ) .
while criticized by many on the grounds that it had few â€˜ teeth â€™ and represented a compromise between the doe and all other departments ( notably those of agriculture and of transport ) , it was none the less a major achievement .
its main sections dealt with the government 's approach to the environment ( nationally , at the european level and globally ) , the nature and effects of the greenhouse effect , environmental problems in both rural and urban areas ( especially in relation to land-use matters ) , pollution control and enhancing awareness of environmental matters .
central to this approach is said to be an emphasis upon guidance from the best available scientific evidence .
there is also a clear recognition of the need for monitoring and modelling of the state of the natural and man-influenced environment .
though there has been a change of prime minister and of the secretary of state for the environment since the publication of the white paper , the environmental cause seems as strong as ever .
thus , the times of 17 december 1990 reported that a group of 40 of the most senior civil servants had met the previous weekend to discuss â€˜ ways in which the government machine could respond better to national and international problems such as the threat of global climate change â€™ .
pearce et al. ( 1989 ) have argued that the effects of government , commercial and other actions on the environment can and should be assessed on a cost/benefit basis and this seems likely to be the basis on which at least the uk government will proceed .
given such a lead , it is scarcely surprising that british scientists have sought to demonstrate the practical and financial consequences of environmental events and processes ; table 9.1 , for example illustrates their perception of the importance of global environmental research to the uk domestic economy .
if it now seems self-evident that monitoring of the global environment is necessary , indeed is even vital , the prediction of what is likely to happen is almost as important : the 170 000 people in the maldives are understandably worried about the prospect of global sea-level change since no part of the islands is more than 2 m above present sea-level !
yet , as we shall see below , the prediction of the activities of natural and man-influenced environmental systems requires an understanding of the interaction of processes that , in many cases , we simply do not yet have .
even monitoring of the present is very imperfect , as witness the order of magnitude variations in estimates now current for deforestation rates .
this chapter , then , attempts to review some of the problems in environmental monitoring and prediction , describes some of the relevant scientific and organizational activities and looks ahead to what is likely to happen next .
the nature of environmental processes
notwithstanding mrs thatcher 's confidence that we can â€˜ fix â€™ environmental problems , the difficulties associated with a task even as apparently simple as monitoring a state variable are considerable .
some of the reasons for this â€” the difficulty of deciding on appropriate proxy variables and on economical yet non-biasing temporal and spatial sampling frameworks , taking account of the relative importance of aperiodic and rare events as compared to near-continuous processes , processing the vast volumes of data usually involved and organizing the multidisciplinary and ( often ) multinational researchers involved â€” are discussed briefly later .
even at this stage , however , it is important to stress that we have a very incomplete understanding of many processes in the natural environment .
the next section therefore attempts to summarize what we do know ; it is derived chiefly from the earth system sciences committee ( essc ) ( 1988 ) .
temporal and spatial scales of operation
even ignoring the effects of man , earth system processes operate at a variety of spatial and temporal scales ( see fig. 9.1 ; see also rosswall et al. 1988 ) .
thus microclimate effects can have major short-term implications for local populations ( such as those brought about by the photochemical smogs of los angeles ) , are often applicable only over areas of a few hectares or less and may operate on a diurnal cycle .
in contrast , soil creation ( cf. soil degradation ) may require hundreds or thousands of years .
in between are variations in phenomena such as el nino .
the sampling theorem indicates that we must sample these phenomena at a frequency of no less than half their wavelength if we are to avoid bias in measurement .
in this chapter , the primary concern is with changes occurring over time spans from minutes to centuries and from spatial wavelengths from about 1 m to about 100 km .
it is , however , impossible to separate out processes acting at different scales and over different periods : a single volcanic eruption lasting hours or days sometimes leads to dust and gas being ejected into the atmosphere over a period of months and this in turn may lead to global climatic fluctuations over years or decades .
conversely , a large-scale and long-period phenomenon such as the movement of tectonic plates can lead to local stress accumulation and to its release by an earthquake in a few seconds and with highly local effects .
this therefore has the following consequences :
1 .
we should know something about the periodicity of the variables we are monitoring if we are not to risk either unnecessarily detailed data collection or aliasing of trends ;
2 .
since we know that the periodicity of some variables is longer than the monitoring already carried out by human beings , we must make use of surrogate or proxy variables to extend our range of knowledge ( such as via tree rings , palynology , oxygen isotope ratios from ice cores and geomorphological evidence of environmental change ) ;
3 .
since we are not yet able to predict all the interactions which may be important in a study of environmental problems , collecting potentially useful data as well as those believed central to the problem under study is often wise ;
4 .
we must accept that most data collection exercises will inevitably be a compromise on the grounds of cost and hence less than perfect data sets will be produced ;
5 .
irrespective of the use of surrogates , monitoring environmental processes only makes sense over time-scales which are extended by human standards ( hence the igbp ( see below ) is designed to run for two or three decades ) ;
6 .
changes in political priorities may simply result in the need for informed guesswork if suitable data are not available .
much attention will be given throughout this chapter to monitoring the environment on a global basis .
this is not merely because of its topical nature .
the main reason is that â€” though some problems are local and are best studied that way â€” many others ( even involving a limited geographical extent ) are best understood within a global framework .
thus no meteorologist would attempt to forecast the weather 2 or 3 days ahead without using a mathematical model based on observations from all around the world .
moreover , recent work has shown that much of the heat energy in the seas of the north atlantic ( every square kilometre of which gives off as much energy as a nuclear power station and hence influences our weather ) is absorbed from sunlight in the tropical pacific and is carried by ocean currents through the drake passage and up into the atlantic .
thus , to understand some local and many regional , national and continental and all global environmental events , we need to have a global perspective and hold global databases ( rhind and mounsey 1989 ; mounsey and tomlinson 1988 ) .
in no way , however , does this invalidate the need for microscale studies â€” for instance , while global data sets may indicate the extent of algal blooms and may suggest causes of them , only detailed study of the algae themselves can provide understanding of why the bloom is occurring .
the processes themselves
a major complication , however , is that the environment can rarely be treated as in a laboratory experiment .
given this , determining the nature of the interactions between the variables becomes a matter of major difficulty .
figure 9.2 is taken from essc ( 1988 ) and is an attempt to show the interactions between environmental processes , as well as the indicators and implications of change in the state of the environment .
in essence , the figure can be summarized as showing processes within the physical climate system and within the biogeochemical one , these systems being interwoven by the global role of water and increasingly affected by human activities .
the main components of the first system are well known : the atmosphere is its engine and atmospheric circulation is driven by differences in solar heating between the equatorial and polar regions .
we are , however , becoming ever more aware of the massive influence of oceans on our climate ; research into ocean/atmosphere interactions is now a priority .
in ocean dynamics studies , important topics are heat storage , circulation and the role of sea ice .
atmospheric circulation ( and , in turn , precipitation and temperature ) is also greatly affected by the balance of thermal energy at the land surface , itself affected by the vegetation and terrain characteristics .
the biogeochemical system embraces the totality of the movements of the key elements essential to life â€” carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , phosphorus and others â€” through what has been described as the total earth system .
the oceans and their biota play a central role in the carbon and nutrient cycles ; global ocean circulation is also critical to the global carbon budget .
trace gases in the atmosphere are key components of the cycles of such elements as carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , sulphur and the halogens ; as is now well known , their concentrations are much influenced by biogenic and anthropogenic activities and the concentrations of such gases as carbon dioxide , ozone , methane , nitrous oxide and the chlorofluoromethanes ( cfms ) strongly affect radiative transfer and provide a link with the physical climate system .
a particular cause for concern is that the concentrations of the two main cfms is increasing by about 5 per cent per annum while the equivalent figures for methane , nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are 1 , 0.4 and 0.3 per cent .
finally , the chemistry of the stratosphere is dominated by the photochemical production and catalytic destruction of ozone .
there are several important ways in which biogeochemical processes can influence climate and hence habitability ( except where the latter is maintained at enormous cost ) .
if , for instance , the concentrations of certain trace gases ( see above ) continue to increase , it has been predicted that the earth 's surface temperature will increase by an amount comparable to that since the last major phase of the most recent glaciation ( about 18 000 years bp ) â€” though there is some dispute about the magnitude of the likely change .
the converse case â€” the effect of physical climate changes on biogeochemical processes â€” is also of obvious importance : changes in annual averages and cycles of temperature and precipitation , together with the probabilities of extreme events such as prolonged droughts or frosts , are major determinants of terrestrial ecosystem type , at least in areas largely unaffected by human activity .
human-induced changes to the environment have increased rapidly as a consequence of growing population numbers and of numerous developments in technology .
fossil fuel combustion , for instance , has led to increased concentrations of sulphate in precipitation ( â€™ acid rain' ) and many rivers , lakes and estuaries have been greatly affected by phosphates from agricultural , urban or industrial sources .
it should be stressed , however , that â€” while the outlines of human activities are clear â€” there are still many uncertainties : for instance , we know that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has risen about 9 per cent since 1959 .
but calculations of the total carbon released by fossil fuel combustion imply that , if all such carbon remained in the atmosphere , the concentration would have increased by twice as much .
the absolute difference between the two figures seems to be due to two different factors : absorption by the oceans and other reductions in carbon stocks in living biota , the latter being strongly affected by human activities since the industrial revolution .
does god play dice ?
much environmental prediction is predicated upon a logical positivist or newtonian deterministic basis .
the environmental systems are effectively regarded as machines whose workings can all be discovered , described in differential equation form and whose future activities can thus be predicted in detail if their initial states are known .
an argument by many atmospheric physicists , for example , is that shortcomings in the accuracy of weather prediction over periods of more than a few days largely results from the unsophisticated nature of existing models , the lack of suitable data and inadequate computer power ( see fig. 9.3 , derived from tyler 1989 ) .
in contrast , the advocates of chaos theory ( e.g. stewart 1989 ) argue that some natural systems are so sensitive to tiny stimuli that even â€˜ the faint beat of a butterfly 's wing could be the ultimate trigger for a hurricane â€™ .
in essence , they argue that tiny differences in the initial conditions of many systems can lead to widely different outcomes since the systems exhibit stochastic behaviour within a deterministic framework .
if so , there is little chance of making accurate long-term forecasts of these systems .
this has been recognized by , among others , essc ( 1988 ) .
the authors of that report accepted that there is a theoretical limit of 2â€“3 weeks in explicit prediction of day-to-day fluctuations in weather because of the influence of small-scale turbulence within the large-scale dynamics ; such limits imply that medium and long-term prediction must inevitably be stochastic .
to complicate matters still further , however , it seems at least possible that the components of the earth system may best be predicted deterministically at some spatial and temporal scales but stochastically at others and that the basis of prediction will differ for different components .
as an example , atmospheric temperature shows marked day-to-day variability , a strong seasonal cycle with some year-to-year variations , a weak minimum variability for 10â€“20 year averages and then increased variation again at longer time-scales ( essc 1988 ) .
it need hardly be pointed out that coping with such multiple databases on which modelling is to be carried out is not a trivial exercise .
finally , it is perhaps worth concluding this section by emphasizing that there is still much controversy among the scientific community about the magnitude of many of the effects being discussed .
in general , the research work of the international groups of scientists , including those involved in the inter-governmental committee and in the uk 's inter-agency committee on global environmental change , has progressively reduced the magnitude of the predicted effects of , for example , global warming .
in giving the 1990 robens coal science lecture at the royal institution , sir john mason ( a former director of the meteorological office ) urged caution in interpreting the results of the massive atmospheric and oceanic modelling exercises ; as the equilibrium models are refined to take account of the thermal lag in oceans , etc. , lower values of predicted changes are likely .
thus , while almost all scientists are â€” at the time of writing â€” convinced from the evidence that change in climate is under way and that regional effects may be much greater than the global average , the magnitude of the latter is now thought likely to be about half of what was predicted only 5 years ago .
who is involved and what is going on ?
if we consider the environment in the broadest sense , much monitoring of it has been in progress for many years and by an enormous diversity of organizations in the uk ; these include the doe , the forestry commission , the nature conservancy , the health and safety executive , local authorities , the component members of the natural environment research council ( such as the institute of terrestrial ecology and the british antarctic survey ) , individuals or research groups in academia , the cegb , the friends of the earth , and uk centre for economic and environmental development ( ceed ) ( 1989 ) .
the diversity of monitoring organizations seems just as great in other countries ; numerous multinational organizations , both quasi-governmental ( e.g. the un environment programme ( unep ) ) and non-governmental ( e.g. the international union for the conservation of nature ( iucn ) and the international institute for environment and development ( iied ) ) are also active in the field .
moreover , commercial monitoring of the environment is now also routine , notably to predict crop yields in the main grain-growing areas and hence facilitate the buying of futures .
the international scientific involvement
scientists have both promoted and responded to the increasing interest in the environment .
thus , at the global scale , the international council of scientific unions ( icsu ) has endorsed the setting up of the international geosphere biosphere project ( igbp ) to â€˜ describe and understand the interactive physical , chemical and biological processes that regulate the total earth system , the unique environment it provides for life , the changes that are occurring in that system and the manner by which these changes are influenced by human actions â€™ ( report of ad hoc planning group for igbp 1986 , quoted in igbp 1988 ) .
priority in the igbp is intended to be given to those areas which deal with key interactions and significant changes on the time-scales of decades to centuries , that most affect the biosphere , that are most susceptible to human perturbations and those that will most likely lead to a practical , predictive capability for global change .
this is to be put into operation by concentrating on four themes :
1 .
documenting and predicting global change ;
2 .
observing and improving our understanding of dominant forcing functions ;
3 .
improving our understanding of interactive phenomena in the total earth system ;
4 .
assessing those effects of global change which will be large scale and cause major modifications to both renewable and non-renewable resources .
by 1990 , igbp had progressed as far as defining a set of seven core projects ( igbp 1990 ) addressing these four themes .
in addition , plans for regional research centres and for the data and information systems for igbp ( known as igbp-dis ) had been announced .
the latter are particularly relevant to this chapter .
based in paris and working under professor i. rasool , it is intended to concentrate on managerial and policy aspects of the task in the first 2 years ( 1990â€“92 ) but then to expand considerably thereafter .
tasks agreed for the igbp-dis include making available a â€˜ directory of data directories â€™ modelled on nasa 's master directory , providing data sets for education and training and undertaking a land cover pilot study .
until 1990 , remarkably little interaction had taken place between the â€˜ hard science â€™ and the social science communities on global monitoring and prediction .
it is noteworthy , however , that the royal society made a plea for just this type of multidisciplinary work in its submission on greenhouse gases to the house of lords ' select committee on science and technology ( royal society 1989 : 40 ) .
fortunately , in addition to the actions of the world â€˜ hard science â€™ community , a parallel effort is now being initiated by social scientists ( fuchs 1989 ; jacobson and price 1990 ) .
currently this is organized and sponsored by the international social science council ( issc ) , the un university and the international federation of institutes of advanced studies .
its objectives are to :
1 .
improve scientific understanding and increase awareness of the complex dynamics governing human interaction with the total earth system ;
2 .
study , explore and anticipate social change affecting the global environment ;
3 .
identify broad social strategies to prevent or mitigate undesirable impacts of global change or to adapt to changes which are unavoidable ;
4 .
analyse policy options for dealing with global environmental change and promoting the goal of sustainable development .
jacobson and price ( 1990 ) provide a useful summary of the ways in which human factors contribute to , and are affected by , likely global changes ; in particular , they stress the importance of the data-handling issues and the role of gis in coping with some of the problems of data integration and manipulation .
the issc proposed its own work programme in the human dimensions of global change in late 1990 .
while these organizations intrinsically have a world-wide membership and are concerned with research into global environmental change , others share the same interest but from a more restricted geographical base .
a leading example of this is the european science foundation which has sponsored research programmes in both the physical and social science aspects of environmental change ( esf 1990 ) .
governmental and political involvement
the spread of environmental awareness is readily demonstrated : in 1972 , 26 countries had environmental and natural resource management agencies whereas , a decade later the number was 144 ( wec 1985 ) .
in most countries , the governmental and political concern with the environment has come somewhat later than that of scientists or concerned lay people : the early development of the green party in the federal republic of germany is something of an exception .
such a commitment to the environment is , none the less , both welcome and necessary if resources are to be made available to tackle existing , let alone forthcoming , environmental problems .
the â€˜ conversion â€™ of the uk government has been briefly described earlier ; it is manifested in their july 1989 commitment to spend â£10m. on climate change research in 1989/90 and the confident request to them from the advisory board for the research councils ( abrc ) for an extra â£11m. in 1990 and â£13m. in the two succeeding years for additional environmental research .
perhaps the most significant development of all , however , is the increasing role of the european commission .
their role in bringing environmental impact assessment ( eia ) on to the statute book is well known , but the commission has now made a proposal ( cec 1989 ) for the â€˜ establishment of the european environment agency and the european environment monitoring and information network â€™ .
the commission argues that there is at present no monitoring of environmental quality and trends on a european scale , nor any guarantee that the results of environmental monitoring will be comparable on a community-wide basis ( a realization brought about through the corine programme described later ) .
the objectives of the new agency would be to assist the community and the member states to achieve the goals set out in the treaty of rome and in successive environmental action programmes ; it must also , however , be seen in the context of the european council 's adoption on 2 december 1988 of the rhodes declaration on the environment and the environment chapter in the single european act which comes into effect in 1992 .
the detailed specific roles of â€˜ the system â€™ ( comprising both agency and network ) are envisaged as :
1 .
to provide the community , the member states and participating third countries with the objective ( sic ) information requested for the formulation and implementation of sound and effective environmental policies ;
2 .
in particular , to provide technical , scientific and economic information requested by the commission in its tasks of identification , preparation and assessment of the implementation and results of environmental action and legislation ;
3 .
to stimulate the development and the application within the agency of techniques of environmental modelling and forecasting in order that adequate preventative action can be taken at the appropriate time ;
4 .
to help ensure the harmonization and comparability of environmental data in the community as well as the integration of european environmental data into international environmental monitoring programmes , such as those established within the framework of the united nations and its system of agencies .
considerable stress is laid by the commission on collaboration with national data-gathering agencies and with states adjacent to the community 's borders .
it is envisaged that the totality of activities will extend the existing state of the european environment report ( cec 1988 ) through addressing the issues of the quality and sensitivity of the environment and also the pressures upon it .
priorities for the new agency include study of atmospheric emissions and quality , water resources and quality ( including the marine environment ) , soil erosion and pollution and important land resources , and biotopes and nature conservation .
at the time of writing , the proposal has been approved and discussions are in progress on the location of the agency 's headquarters .
it seems certain to have major and growing effects upon environmental monitoring and prediction in europe and on the policies of component governments .
yet this is by no means the only plan which the community has in relation to the environment : directorate-general xii ( that for science , research and development ) has published details of an extensive r&d programme ( cec 1990a ) and the commission as a whole ( cec 1990b ) has made public its plans to develop regular official statistics of the environment .
the private sector
certain aspects of environmental monitoring have long been carried out by the private sector , notably that of crop states on a world-wide basis .
derived from satellite imagery at comparatively low resolution , predicted yields for different crops in different nation states become of commercial value .
however , significant resources are also being made available by the private sector where there is no immediate commercial gain : thus ibm uk ltd has donated â£3.5m. of computing equipment to unep and ibm in general is actively supporting other r&d which can be expected to facilitate â€˜ sustainable development â€™ : ibm europe , for instance , has invested $16m. in its bergen scientific centre to make it the focal point for the company 's environmental modelling and a centre for information on the environment and sustainable development .
on a more modest basis , ibm uk have agreed to fund a pilot global population database being built in birkbeck college to permit assessment of the impact of environmental change on the world s population .
many other companies , of course , are supporting environmental work but ibm seems almost to be unique in its corporate commitment to use of high technology for facilitating â€˜ sustainable development â€™ .
some examples of environmental monitoring projects
the local scale
at the local scale , it is usually impossible to neglect the effects of multiple processes operating .
an example of environmental modelling and prediction where the interactions between different processes and dynamic feedback is taken into account is given by haber and schaller ( 1988 ) .
their work formed part of one unesco man and biosphere ( mab ) project , carried out in the berchtesgaden national park in bavaria .
following holling ( 1978 ) and grossman ( 1983 ) , they conceptualized the man/environment relationship at a series of hierarchical levels :
1 .
the lowest , or process , level , is directly and ( usually ) obviously connected to perceived reality .
thus processes and interrelationships are mostly obvious , simple and linear ; data are usually readily available and may be voluminous .
this level is readily handled in commercial gis ; ,
2 .
the intermediate , or dynamic , level is concerned with less frequent and often irregular events , e.g. a temporary lack of water because of fire , frost or excessive demand from an increasing populace .
characteristically , the data used may be more difficult to obtain and are usually more spatially aggregated ; modelling software which permits feedback loops is essential ;
3 .
the top , or strategic , level is the most difficult to explore ; the external influences are often unpredictable by formal means .
relevant data are therefore difficult to identify and scenario building is one of the few approaches available .
the haber and schaller approach is to â€˜ soft-couple â€™ these different levels and their accompanying approaches using an ecological balance model .
results of running this with different scenarios include â€˜ time slice â€™ maps of possible outcomes and of the exchange of material and energy within the study area .
while ultimately qualitative , it seems to offer a method for coping with different types of process and incorporating stochastic and truly random events .
the national and continental scale : the corine project
the corine programme represents the product of much activity by the european commission 's directorate-general ( xi ) for the environment .
it originates from an italian request to the council of ministers in 1973 to identify environmentally â€˜ balanced â€™ and â€˜ unbalanced â€™ areas in the community ; the first attempts to do this were unsuccessful and , though by 1981 it was clear that a new approach based on an environmental information system was the most promising one , funding for this was not secured until 1985 .
a 4-year experimental programme to â€˜ collect , co-ordinate and ensure the consistency of information on the state of the environment and natural resources in the european communities â€™ was set up and labelled corine .
the objectives of corine were to be achieved through bringing together existing data holdings in the member states , developing methods for holding , analysing and presenting the data , and encouraging the exchange of data .
a number of priority areas were identified , including biotopes of importance for nature conservation , acid deposition and its effects on soils and biotopes and the protection of the environment of the mediterranean region ( briggs and martin 1988 ) .
many achievements can be claimed by the corine project team .
as a result of some 40 sub-projects involving all the member states ( and often several groups within each one ) , databases of topography , soils , water resources and quality , biotopes , atmospheric emissions , climate , soil erosion and administrative boundaries have been built up for the whole community and can be interrelated ; other data sets ( such as land cover , derived from satellite imagery ) have already been compiled for some of the member states .
various aspects of the corine project have been described in papers by rhind et al. ( 1986 ) , wiggins et al. ( 1987 ) , briggs and martin ( 1988 ) , briggs and mounsey ( 1989 ) and cec ( 1990c ) .
for the present purposes , however , the key findings are :
1 .
many necessary data sets were unavailable for reasons of administrative inadequacies , confidentiality constraints , cost or non-collection in certain countries ;
2 .
the unavoidable reliance upon existing data sets led to many problems due to non-harmonization even of commonly used variables , e.g. eight different definitions of potential evapo-transpiration were in use in the member states and â€˜ maximum temperature â€™ at each weather station was defined in at least four different ways ;
3 .
the compilation of a spatially coherent database from mapped information compiled by different organizations at different scales and on different topographic bases ( see rhind and clark 1988 ) is often difficult ;
4 .
user expectations are often unreasonably high ; use of administrative computing systems encourages bureaucrats to believe that environmental data can just as readily be analysed and used to support decisions .
the â€˜ fuzzy â€™ nature of much geographically distributed data , the inherent errors in it , the effects of the processing algorithms used and the assumption of known interactions between variables ensures that completely routine use by unskilled users is unlikely to be possible in the foreseeable future ;
5 .
more detailed data are required for particular tasks as the role of corine grows .
the european commission 's proposal for an environment agency ( see above ) will subsume the corine team and databases .
the global scale : nasa and gems/grid
without question , the largest â€˜ player â€™ in the global environment arena is nasa .
the organization has initiated many of the schemes which now are under discussion â€” the igbp , for instance , has been strongly influenced by nasa proposals .
a summary of current activities and future plans is given in nasa ( 1988b ) .
by way of example , current programmes are collecting global data on stratospheric ozone , on sea-surface and sea-ice variables and on the earth 's radiation budget .
approved future programmes include the upper atmosphere research satellite , the nasa scatterometer and the joint nasa/cnes ocean topography experiment .
in addition , however , funding has recently been approved for a much more ambitious scheme â€” the earth observing system ( eos ) .
this is conceived not as a set of hardware but as a comprehensive information system focused on the needs identified by the essc ( see above ) and anticipating somewhat those of igbp .
it will collate data from the two proposed space station polar platforms , one european space agency platform , a japanese one and also from the manned space station .
on this basis , a data flow of no less than 1 terabyte ( i.e. 10&sup12 ; bytes ) day is anticipated by the mid-1990s .
a major user of nasa data and skills has been the un environment programme .
formed in the wake of the 1972 stockholm conference , unep soon spawned the global environment monitoring system ( gems ) as well as an international register of potentially toxic chemicals and a global network of sources to locate and provide technical , scientific and management information on the environment .
the need for a mechanism to handle the global environmental data was defined in the early 1980s and the global resources information database ( grid ) resulted .
mooneyhan ( 1988 ) has described the progress of the pilot stage of grid which culminated in approval for a full operational phase ; grid is now involved in integrating , storing and exploiting a variety of global environmental databases , mostly acquired from nasa .
in addition to the work being carried out in the unep hq at nairobi and in the gems/grid site in geneva , a series of grid regional nodes are now being set up world-wide , each equipped with the same hardware and software and local subsets of the data .
the first of these is in bangkok and another is to be opened in latin america .
moreover , national nodes are also being set up ; the recent ibm gift to grid ( see above ) has ensured that powerful microcomputers have been installed in many african countries , together with national and continental data sets .
training of unskilled staff to operate this equipment and to exploit the scientific data is now a major role for grid staff .
technical aspects and problems
it follows from much of the above that there are major challenges in use of environmental data .
these are best considered by itemizing characteristics of contemporary environmental monitoring and prediction :
1 .
the use of secondary data , rather than primary data collected by the data analyst ;
2 .
the need , at least with data on the terrestrial environment , for an inference process to extract useful information from the secondary ( and often proxy ) data ;
3 .
the data volumes collected are often voluminous even by the standards of contemporary computing facilities ;
4 .
the analyses carried out are often arcane in detail to all but a small group of â€˜ high priests â€™ ;
5 .
we have only a limited capacity for checking the accuracy of many environmental monitoring results , let alone of predictions .
some of these characteristics are now addressed in slightly more detail ; it will be obvious that such problems merit a paper in themselves .
remote sensing as a data collection process
as the need for more extensive , high-resolution yet consistent and up-to-date data becomes more pressing , increased use of remote sensing seems inevitable .
no other data collection methodology obviates the short distance variation in data sets induced by variations in data collection and aggregation methodology typically encountered between adjacent nation states .
the problem is now recognized , especially in europe , and strenuous efforts are being made to harmonise the data sets ( e.g. through the use of standard classifications , such as that for land use produced by the conference of european statisticians in 1989 ) .
at present , however , ground-collected environmental data are far less than ideal .
recognizing this , nasa ( 1988a ) concluded that forthcoming global science projects would need land surface altitude data at three resolutions : 1 km resolution in xy and 10â€“100 m resolution in z on a global basis , 100 m xy resolution and 1â€“10 m resolution in z for regional databases and 10 m xy resolution and 0.1â€“1 m in z for local studies .
they argued that existing maps and digitized files from them are unable to meet these needs at global or regional scale and only remote sensing could help in the short term : the availability of stereometric data from the french spot satellite has already led to proposals for automated creation of global digital elevation models with a spatial ( xy ) resolution of about 30 m ( muller 1989 ) .
for many terrestrial purposes , however , a substantial inference process must take place to convert the radiometric measurements into useful information ( in contrast , more direct measurements of sea state , etc. are possible ) .
the value of this information is inherently dependent upon the quality of the inference process and that in turn depends upon the complexity of the scene , the spatial , temporal and spectral resolution of the sensors and the particular algorithms used .
thus far , for instance , accuracies of land cover ( let alone what is often needed , i.e. land use ) determined from landsat and spot imagery for the uk have rarely been higher than 70 per cent unless trivial classifications ( e.g. built/unbuilt land ) have been used .
one solution to this is to â€˜ densify â€™ the ground control and another is to use contextually based classifiers rather than the traditional , spectrally based ones .
but the ground conditions in some parts of europe make good results extremely difficult to obtain : some areas of portugal , for instance , have field sizes of only a few metres and exhibit multi-level and multi-seasonal cropping .
a further difficulty is the cost of the data in relation to its anticipated benefits .
relatively few cost/benefit studies have yet been carried out except in such areas as crop prediction and ocean navigation ( where they are generally shown to be highly advantageous in saving someone else 's money ) .
it may be that a study commissioned from contractors by the british national space centre will provide useful evidence on the cash value of remote sensing ; it is particularly timely in view of the appointment of professor pearce ( see above ) as the adviser to the uk secretary of state for the environment .
other work on assessment of costs and benefits of such data have been carried out for the french government by professor didier ( 1990 ) .
finally , since data are often costly to acquire , it follows that summaries of them e.g. the state of the european environment report ( cec 1988 ) and the environmental data report of the un ep ( gems marc 1989 ) are of considerable value .
equally , the â€˜ signposting â€™ role now being adopted by unep 's grid project â€” which is expected to offer on-line access to a catalogue of environmental data sets and details of the responsible agencies in 1991 â€” is to be welcomed .
the data problem and partial solutions
the lack of harmonization of definitions and methods of collection of environmental data have already been outlined above .
in the european community of 12 nation states , for instance , no less than eight procedures for calculating potential evapo-transpiration have been in use !
the need for harmonization is obvious and , in this respect , must follow from the successful pioneering achievements of eurostat in harmonizing the definitions in trade , demographic and other â€˜ social science â€™ statistics ( see cec 1990b ) .
an additional and severe problem is that the volumes of data which are already collected are huge by the standards of only a decade ago .
by 1995/96 , they will be very much greater , notably from the eos programme .
nasa has announced plans to collect up to 1 terabyte ( 10&sup12 ; bytes ) day .
since remote sensing data sets ( especially those pertaining to terrestrial areas of the globe ) typically need much pre-processing to calibrate , transform and then perform an inference process and hence convert measurements of the radiation reflected or emitted by small areas of ground into useful ( e.g. land cover ) data , the processing power required is going to be formidable .
other , non-remote-sensing data sets are smaller in volume but more complex in structure and in their characteristics .
to hold all of the 1/50 000 scale topographic map coverage alone for the european community would probably require about 3 terabytes of storage .
parenthetically , the form in which the data may be held can affect dramatically the scale of the problem faced .
it would be technically possible , for instance , to hold in less than 1 terabyte detailed information for every individual in the world , akin to that collected about everyone in the uk through the census of population .
in practice , legislation generally forbids such data being held thus and distributed in anything other than area aggregate form ; the cross-tabulations commonly employed ( e.g. to give tables of population numbers broken down by age and sex ) often result in a great multiplication of the data volumes .
this all presents major problems of data storage , handling ( especially for global data sets ) , display and dissemination .
fortunately , technical developments have ensured that the increase in computing power per unit cost has been growing at about an order of magnitude every 6 years over the last three decades .
indeed , this may grossly under-represent the present situation : the rapid spread of unix-based systems seems to facilitate competition and , at the time of writing , performance of workstations per unit cost seems to be increasing at about 50 per cent per annum .
moreover , the advent of low-cost , high-density-storage devices like cd-roms may well make substantial data sets available even to those with modest computing power : a cd-rom , for instance , can hold about 600 megabytes ( i.e. 10&sup6 ; bytes ) , can be reproduced currently for about â£1 and read on a device costing about â£400 .
yet , despite such revolutionary changes in technology , novel solutions will still be required to make effective use of the new data sets .
one such solution is goodchild and yang 's ( 1989 ) scheme for a hierarchical spatial data structure to handle data for the spherical earth .
a particular problem is that little or no quantitative regard has been paid until recently to the effects of quality variation in environmental data .
the literature of the last few years is thronged with papers proposing that these must be taken into account â€” but with few realistic proposals on how this is to be achieved .
goodchild ( 1988 ) has made perhaps the best summary of the problem and possible solutions to date .
finally , relatively little emphasis has been given to the management of data as a corporate resource , available to a wide community : many environmental data are collected on a project-by-project basis and â€˜ lost â€™ once the urgency of the initial research is over .
however , the 1990 report of the data and facilities working group of the uk inter-agency committee on global environmental change argued strongly that planning for the dissemination and maintenance of such data was a vital role .
it also noted that ownership of and access to environmental data was a policy matter of the greatest importance ; this may be more difficult in â€˜ within country â€™ data than with global data since the latter are often already the subject of international exchange agreements at zero cost .
global environmental research and the social sciences
thus far , the emphasis has been very much on the natural science aspects of environmental monitoring and prediction .
that is unremarkable since the anticipation of such problems and assessments of some of their causes and magnitudes can only be made by environmental scientists .
yet the consequences of any significant changes are a matter of the utmost concern to planners and to politicians at all levels , the quantification of the costs and benefits of alternative policy strategies is very much a matter for economists , and the adaptation of societies to massive change is a particular interest to sociologists and others .
for geographers â€” who span the conventional ( and now archaic ) dichotomy between the natural and the environmental sciences â€” all of these aspects need to be woven together to anticipate the likely spatial patterns of the effects of massive change , the redistributions in trade , health and wealth which they will bring about and the â€˜ knock on â€™ effects these consequences themselves will have on society and the environment .
for social scientists , then , environmental monitoring and prediction are a matter of considerable significance , especially as â€˜ globalization â€™ of markets and economies proceeds .
the economic and social research council ( esrc ) commissioned two reports on global environmental change to guide or at least inform the allocation of research funding .
these reports ( pearce 1990 ; turner 1990 ) may be taken as informed views from at least the economists in the uk social science community on the social science aspects of global environmental change .
pearce ( 1990 ) , for instance , presented an economist 's views of the high-priority topics for research as follows :
1 .
the theory and practice of international agreements , viewed in a game theory context ;
2 .
the theory of optimal behaviour under scientific uncertainty ; ,
3 .
cost-benefit frameworks , especially for dealing with man-induced climatic effects ;
4 .
definition of the impacts of climate change on eastern europe and the developing countries ;
5 .
appropriate policies on non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases ;
6 .
assessment of the ecological values of tropical forest ;
7 .
economic instruments for reducing greenhouse gases ;
8 .
the international politics of climate change ;
9 .
national and global energy options given the greenhouse effect ;
10 .
trade and global change .
turner ( 1990 ) argued that the priorities are as follows :
1 .
the socio-economic consequences of sea-level rise ;
2 .
techniques for the valuation of environmental resources and effects ;
3 .
an assessment of management tools , institutional adaptation and policy integration in regard to global environmental change ;
4 .
studies of agriculture in relation to climate change ;
5 .
understanding of how environmental issues and technical change interact ;
6 .
the interrelationship between environmental ethics and economics .
there is , then , no shortage of social science research which is claimed to be necessary if we are to cope with environmental change .
some of it is being carried out : in march 1991 esrc announced a â£6m programme of research on global environmental change .
however , perhaps most critical of all in the early stages is social science practice rather than research .
in the usa at least , there needs to be an improvement in scientists ' understandings of how to influence the allocation of funding for remedial measures or for further research ( see kitsos and ashe 1989 ) .
all too often , it seems that the coupling of an as yet imperfect scientific understanding to policy-making is tenuous ( see table 9.2 ) .
fortunately , considerable high-quality work has already begun on the legal , political and institutional aspects of global environmental change ( see , for instance , nitze 1990 ) .
what next ?
the contents of this chapter have scarcely touched upon such important environmental research as the world ocean climate experiment or the world climate research programme .
nor has there been any discussion of the growing requirement in the uk ( as elsewhere ) to carry out an environmental impact assessment for all major developments .
the consequences for some nations or subgroups in a population of being without access to environmental data or the tools for analysing them while others have such access are potentially profound â€” as the european commission has recognized in issuing a directive on public access to environmental data ( cec 1990d ) â€” yet space limitations have also precluded their discussion .
despite these shortcomings dictated by the space available , what has been said should be sufficient to illustrate the enormous and diverse scope of environmental monitoring and prediction .
such is its diversity that measuring the total expenditure on it seems quite impossible and the number of â€˜ actors â€™ already involved is vast .
what is clear , however , is that monitoring is rarely a simple exercise , that the time-scales of the sponsors of monitoring and environmental research are rarely long term though most science is inevitably of this nature and that the increasingly multinational nature of such work necessitates a degree of management not always present in local or nationally based schemes .
in these circumstances , it is scarcely surprising that there is evidence of international and interdisciplinary dispute , as terney ( 1989 ) has chronicled in regard to igbp .
moreover , as newby ( 1990 ) has pointed out , the complexities of environmental research have created a new kind of relationship between research and policy : â€˜ in the past , â€¦ the relationship was predicated on the belief that science provided decision-makers with objective â€˜ hard â€™ facts on which to base their soft , value-ridden policies â€¦ .
but now we find scientists delivering only â€˜ soft â€™ , uncertain â€˜ facts â€™ to decision-makers facing â€˜ hard â€™ decisions . â€™
yet , even if all of this causes great uncertainty among scientists , it is still a reasonable prediction that a decade ahead will see both environmental monitoring and prediction treated as an everyday need and activity in major organizations .
we shall also see the existence of binding requirements upon national governments â€” certainly in the european community â€” to collect at least basic environmental indicators in a harmonized form ( cec 1990b ) .
more than that , it seems highly likely that the social science aspects of environmental problems will underpin the actions of governments and international agencies .
perhaps the single most important conclusion to be drawn from this review is that the monitoring , modelling and management of the global environment are tasks which uniquely require the integration of skills and techniques from many disciplines .
building such research teams is essential .
underlying it all , however , is one obvious fact : that the gathering and analysis of geographically distributed environmental data form the necessary starting-point for ensuring the success of our future on earth .

managing natural and technological hazards
anthony c. gatrell and peter vincent
introduction
few areas of the application of gis technology can be as socially significant , or environmentally relevant , as the management of emergencies and disasters due to natural and technological hazards .
whether attempting to construct a database of resources for use in planning responses to nuclear emergencies , developing optimal routes for scheduling the safe transport of hazardous substances , or monitoring the health implications of a disaster , gis can assist in identifying possibilities and formulating solutions .
the 1990s have been declared the international decade for natural disaster reduction .
let us hope that g1s can , in some small way , help mitigate the suffering and hardship felt by all those afflicted by the effects of hazards which , as we have learnt with bitter recent experience in the uk , can occur in an untimely fashion in the most improbable of places .
research on hazards is multidisciplinary and straddles the social , environmental and mathematical sciences .
if , for instance , we wish to model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas resulting from a chemical explosion , assess its possible impact on human health and evaluate likely evacuation scenarios of the population at risk we would require , for example , a knowledge of atmospheric dispersion models , epidemiology and population distribution .
some researchers suggest that hazards ( and emergencies that might result ) can be regarded as either natural or technological .
we shall elaborate on this simple division below but suggest here that the wealth of literature on the former ( see , for instance , burton et al. 1978 and perry 1981 ) has yet to be matched by a similar volume of work on the latter .
there are signs that this imbalance is being rectified ( zeigler et al. 1983 ) .
hazard research , like few other gis application areas , is not only stretching the present technology to its limits but is a quite remarkable focus of international effort into several important research-related areas such as expert systems and simulation studies .
in this sense the scene is clearly one of hazard problems looking for improved gis rather than for gis looking for good problems , as is all too often the case .
hazard research
what are hazards ?
formally , a hazard can be defined as : â€˜ a physical situation with a potential for human injury , damage to property , damage to the environment , or some combination of these â€™ ( health and safety executive 1989 : 30 ) .
a hazard is a threat which , given a set of circumstances , may become translated into a realized event .
what we choose to call this event depends upon factors such as its magnitude : we speak for instance of accidents , emergencies , disasters and catastrophes , each of which carries connotations concerning the scale of the event and each of which will have a set of human and/or environmental consequences .
on 30 march 1956 one of the most powerful volcanic disturbances this century , the bezymianny eruption , occurred .
few people noticed the event as it took place in an uninhabited part of kamchatcka and caused no known casualties .
in contrast , the extrusion of a small volume of lava from a secondary cone on the slopes of tristan da cunha became the focus of global interest when , during october 1961 , the island 's lobster processing plant was smothered and the 300 people of the island 's only settlement were evacuated to the uk .
these two contrasting events emphasize the central fact that even natural hazards are not defined solely by the characteristics of the event but by the interaction of those events with the human occupation of the threatened area .
as noted above , the simple division of hazards is between those which are natural and those which are technological or human-induced .
each of these may be further subdivided and the typology shown in fig. 10.1 draws upon the classic work of burton and kates ( 1964 ) in separating geophysical from biological hazards and zeigler et al. ( 1983 ) in distinguishing public ( or what we might call societal ) hazards from private ( individual ) ones .
the further subdivision of natural hazards is self-explanatory as is that of individual technological hazards .
zeigler divides the public hazards into those which result from the production of raw materials and manufactured goods , those which originate in transport and transmission and those which threaten the public in their role as consumers .
the united nations disaster relief organization ( undro ) has produced a classification of disasters , derived on the basis of case data ( table 10.1 ) .
undro recognizes three basic types of disaster : accidents , natural events , and other disasters .
the differentiation of accidents from other types is useful in the context of emergency planning and is not so clearly conveyed by other hazard typologies .
however , the temptation in all classification exercises is to produce partitional schemes and this should really be resisted here .
it is more useful ( johnson 1983 ) to adopt a non-partitional scheme ( fig. 10.1 ) that recognizes , for instance , food poisoning as both a personal and consumer hazard , or lead pollution ( e.g. from car exhausts ) as both a meteorological event and technological hazard ( both public and private ) .
an air crash ( as at lockerbie ) affects an entire community directly , as well as being an occupational hazard and risk to the individual traveller .
hillslope failure ( as at aberfan in south wales in 1966 ) is a geomorphic hazard but may arise because of raw material extraction .
dutch elm disease is a floral hazard but is exacerbated by the transport of infected logs .
hohensemer et al. ( 1983 ) make the important point that hazards are multidimensional in nature and suggest 12 dimensions along which any hazard may be scored ( see table 10.2 ) .
these factors will , of course , be important in deciding on the role that gis can play in hazard monitoring and emergency planning .
for instance , some events will persist briefly , have immediate consequences , minor transgenerational effects and have little or no potential for non-human mortality ( an air crash is an example ) .
others , such as a chemical explosion involving the release of a toxic gas , may persist for a week or more , have delayed consequences , may affect a future generation if the toxic chemical is mutagenic and may have a significant impact on plant and animal populations .
there may be more scope for a gis approach in the latter than in the former situations .
the hohensemer scheme is not , however , beyond criticism .
for example , can hazards really be thought of as having any intentionality ?
industrial hazards and risk assessment
once hazards have been identified there may follow efforts to assess the hazard risk .
by â€˜ risk â€™ we understand â€˜ the likelihood of a specified undesired event occurring within a specified period or in specified circumstances â€™ ( health and safety executive 1989 : 30 ) .
it may , of course , be easier to quantify risk for natural hazards because of historical records and statistical estimation of recurrence intervals .
technological hazards are more unpredictable and may be extremely rare , so that it becomes difficult to use probability concepts to quantify risk , especially those which rely on notions of relative frequency .
the identification of chemical hazards requires that the locations of sites be known , together with the dangerous substances stored or processed there .
in the uk ( see petts 1988 for a splendid overview ) the health and safety executive must be notified of sites where hazardous substances in excess of threshold limits are handled .
such substances and thresholds include , for instance , 25 tonnes of flammable liquid petroleum gas and the explosive sodium chlorate , and 10 tonnes of toxic chlorine gas .
some 1600 installations are notifiable , along with thousands of kilometres of pipelines ( mostly high-pressure natural gas transmission lines ) .
following a number of major accidents involving industrial activities ( including those at flixborough , humberside in 1974 ; beek , the netherlands in 1975 ; and seveso and manfredonia in italy in 1976 ) , the ec issued a directive on major accident hazards .
the directive , which is commonly referred to as the â€˜ seveso â€™ directive , was issued in june 1982 and in the uk its requirements were embodied in the control of major accident hazard ( cimah ) regulations ( 1984 ) .
among other things , these regulations require operators of hazardous installations to draw up on-site and off-site emergency plans and to give information to members of the public who live or work near such installations ( houston 1987 ) .
there are presently about 300 cimah sites .
however , many potentially hazardous chemical installations are not covered by such regulations .
clearly , a plant which stores 1 tonne less than is required for notification slips through the net , while large numbers of handling sites ( warehouses , for instance ) are not covered .
the regulations have obvious implications for g1s work , as illustrated below .
in halton borough , cheshire , for instance , there are 13 notifiable installations , with over 20 000 people living within the defined â€˜ consultation zones â€™ ( petts 1988 ) .
it is also relevant to point out here the work of the health and safety executive in developing techniques for quantitative risk assessment ( health and safety executive 1989 ) .
such techniques include the use of a â€˜ risk assessment tool â€™ ( riskat ) , inputs to which include data on wind direction and speed ; the output of which is a map of calculated risk contours .
in societal risk assessment â€˜ it is also necessary to input data on the distribution of population around the installation .
this can be a difficult and time-consuming process , and inevitably some simplifying assumptions are needed â€™ ( health and safety executive 1989 : 17 ) .
again , the g1s implications are clear and are discussed below .
hazardous waste disposal
the disposal of both nuclear and non-nuclear wastes has proved to be of major public concern in recent years .
the rather clumsy handling by nirex of the search for sites to store low- and intermediate-level wastes , together with very recent worries about the import of toxic wastes such as polychlorinated biphenyls ( pcbs ) , are but two examples of such concern in the uk .
however , while the former has been given considerable attention by geographers ( summarized by openshaw et al. 1989 ) there has been relatively little such work in the uk on the disposal of non-nuclear wastes .
this contrasts with the situation in the usa ( greenberg and anderson 1984 ) , where the clean-up of abandoned sites is a priority .
certainly , in terms of the volume of waste generated in the uk non-nuclear hazardous industrial wastes should be high on the environmental agenda ; while less than 1 million tonnes of all nuclear wastes were generated in 1985â€“86 , 10 times that amount were generated of hazardous wastes ( openshaw et al. 1989 : 13 ) .
attention should be drawn to the three annual reports of the hazardous waste inspectorate ( now merged with other branches of the doe to form her majesty 's inspectorate of pollution ) .
these contain some valuable material on disposal practices , and volumes of waste generated and disposed of by each waste regulation authority ( wra ) â€” counties in england , districts in wales , scotland and northern ireland .
each wra is required to produce a waste disposal plan and these are starting to appear .
they too contain useful material on , for instance , the locations of sites , though individual site licences must be consulted for details of what each is permitted to take in the way of hazardous wastes .
what is not known is information on the locations of former sites , at which quite toxic materials may have been dumped , though recent work by egger ( 1989 ) in austria has mapped a vast number of such sites .
it is these , rather than existing , licensed sites which should be a focus of research activity , particularly when examining possible links to ill health .
we simply do not have enough evidence yet to back up the claim that â€˜ people are almost certainly ill , dead , or dying because of these sloppy waste disposal activities â€™ ( openshaw et al. 1989 : 12 ) .
research is in progress , however , to assess possible health effects of poor incineration ( diggle et al. 1990 ) .
particular attention should be focused on hospital incinerators , since these have been subject to crown immunity for many years and most are technically ill-equipped to burn at sufficiently high temperatures for adequate disposal of wastes ( gatrell and lovett 1991 ) .
we need to produce an inventory of all such sites , together with a publicly available , comprehensive database on all sites accepting hazardous industrial wastes .
emergency planning
it is convenient to retain the nuclear/non-nuclear distinction when discussing the background to emergency planning .
nuclear emergency planning in the uk has been reviewed by matthews and pepper ( 1981 ) .
nuclear power stations must prepare a plan and submit this to the nuclear installations inspectorate and health and safety executive for approval .
evacuation plans are required to cover an area within a distance of 2.4 km ; these detail the roles to be played by the emergency services .
the very narrow emergency planning zones contrast with those in the usa ( collins 1981 ) , where planning is required up to 16 km from the site to cover exposure to radiation plumes .
local authorities in the uk that have declared themselves â€˜ nuclear-free â€™ have been highly critical of british planning , calling for an extension of emergency zones to at least 24 km .
zeigler et al. ( 1983 ) should be consulted for material relating to evacuation behaviour in the wake of the incident at three mile island .
in the uk little work of any description seems to have been done on human behaviour in the aftermath of releases of hazardous substances , nor is much available on public attitudes to emergency planning .
indeed , no major studies of evacuation due to hazards have been undertaken in recent times and this is a widely recognized deficiency which no research funding body seems willing to rectify .
in the usa on the other hand , a good deal of useful research in these areas has been undertaken .
this research is brought together in very useful reports produced by the oak ridge national laboratory , tennessee ( sorenson et al. 1987 ; vogt and sorenson 1987 ) and the disaster research centre , university of delaware .
perry ( 1985 ) has written an interesting book on emergency planning and evacuation , covering both natural and technological hazards .
for him , comprehensive emergency planning and management involve : prevention , protection , response and restoration .
by prevention we understand the elimination or reduction in risk , perhaps by adequate zoning or safe routeing of shipments , for instance .
included in protection are methods for detecting likely hazard events and in warning those likely to be affected .
response includes search and rescue ( including the need to cope with secondary threats such as contamination of water supplies after an explosion , or fire following an earthquake ) .
as perry and others have noted , relatively few resources are devoted to the first two aspects , the bulk going to response and restoration ( rebuilding ) .
it should be clear from this brief description that these issues are inherently geographical .
in one of the few studies of evacuation behaviour after a non-nuclear hazard event liverman and wilson ( 1981 ) give weight to this argument .
in 1979 a train carrying chlorine , liquid petroleum , toluene and propane was derailed in mississauga , ontario , causing a series of explosions .
this led to the evacuation of 250 000 people which , although staggered over several days , led to great pressure on transport arteries .
an important finding was that many relied on their own transport and went to stay with friends and relatives some distance away , rather than relying on the 19 official evacuation reception centres .
despite this , the evacuation was successful , partly because the accident occurred at a weekend and the immediately affected area was sparsely populated .
in addition , the police were well prepared , stimulated largely by implementing a plan designed more to cope with an emergency at the nearby toronto international airport than for the event in question .
it is not without interest to note that in the usa there is a federal emergency management agency ( fema ) , established in 1978 , charged with dealing with all types of emergency planning and management .
in the uk there is no equivalent , though the spate of disasters in the past 4 years ( involving over 1000 lives lost ) has led to several calls for such a national body to be established .
natural hazards
in this short space it is not possible to go into any depth on the nature of particular natural hazards but only to highlight those aspects relevant to gis .
needless to say , the study of natural hazards is important , a statement brought into sharp focus by the fact that natural hazards account for up to 4 per cent of total deaths in the world each year ( mitchell , 1974 ) .
in 1970 , for example , more than 200 000 people died in the cyclone and flooding of bangladesh and in 1979 the hurricanes david and frederick caused more than $3bn damage in the usa .
shah ( 1983 ) made a comprehensive investigation of natural disaster reports for the period 1974â€“80 and concluded that both disaster frequency and magnitude ( measured in terms of lives lost ) are increasing .
high death tolls are still a characteristic of less developed , low-income countries .
surprisingly , fog is the third most important hazard in europe after floods and volcanoes .
research on natural hazards has a long tradition in geography going back more than half a century .
much of the impetus for such research arose in the usa from observations on river basin management and the need to reduce flood damage .
the vast majority of natural hazards studies have ignored the physical nature of the events per se and have concentrated on behavioural issues such as the perception and estimation of hazards .
this emphasis is partly due to the background of the researchers involved ( many are human geographers and sociologists ) and partly because it is only really since the second world war that major hazards have been monitored systematically , culminating , of course , in the last decade or so in the use of satellite technology .
brief reference to two examples of natural hazards may illustrate the potential relevance of a gis approach , applications of which are considered below .
jones et al. ( 1989 ) have examined the distribution of some 8500 landslides in the uk .
their maps show clearly an increased propensity for landsliding in the north and west of the uk .
more to the point , however , is the fact that this distribution can be modelled in terms of slopes , rainfall , rock types and so on .
in other words the actual hazard distribution can be understood and areas at risk identified .
the potential benefits to insurance companies , engineers and planners are clear .
second , a well-known winter hazard in the uk , with marked spatial localization , is fog .
predictive models of its distribution have clear implications for road and air safety .
perry ( 1981 ) describes a fog potential index that is a function of local topography , environmental features affecting fog formation and distance from standing water bodies .
reliance is currently placed on a network of monitoring stations , often sparsely located and frequently outside fog-prone areas ; gis could implement a predictive model based on digitized map features and indeed the model could also be used in site allocation studies for airports and the like .
the majority of natural hazard research has focused on single hazards but of course any area may be prone to more than one hazard type .
this idea led hewitt and burton ( 1971 ) to develop the concept of â€˜ all-hazards-at-a-place â€™ .
to achieve this they concentrated on the whole spectrum of damaging events in an area and explored their aggregate impact .
the implications for gis in the development of â€˜ hazardousness â€™ indices are obvious and if time-series data are available there is the potential to produce a variety of probability maps .
the collection of historical data on natural hazards is important since it is clear that their spatial pattern varies through time .
many areas that appear to be hazard-free on current maps may merely by passing through a temporary period of quiescence .
this is perhaps best illustrated with reference to earthquakes .
for example , in 1692 , the whole of southern england was affected by an earthquake whose epicentre was located in what is now belgium ; a good deal of minor structural damage was inflicted ( morse 1983 ) .
presumably the builders of the channel tunnel are aware of this ?
environmental epidemiology
this is , of course , a vast subject area , embracing the impact of the natural and technological environments on human health .
it covers , for instance , the associations between water and air pollution and ill health , links between geological and pedological environments and ill health , as well as associations between specific technological hazards ( e.g. high-voltage power lines ) and possible health effects .
we can only consider a small fraction of this work here ; little consideration is given to occupational environments , for instance .
in the uk such research is widespread though there are specialist environmental epidemiology research institutes at southampton and cardiff ( funded by the medical research council ) , and others at the university of surrey ( robens institute ) and at the london school for hygiene and tropical medicine .
the latter houses the small area health statistics research unit ( sahsru ) , which has a specific remit to conduct research into morbidity and mortality at local scales ( elliot 1988 ) .
the sahsru liaises closely with opcs .
the kinds of databases used by these groups are discussed below .
greenberg ( 1983 ) and a collection of papers in greenberg ( 1987 ) review some of the literature on environmental epidemiology .
it seems worth stating at the outset that there are two ways geographical research in this general area can proceed .
one is to collect morbidity and mortality data ( usually the latter is more widely available , though the former more useful ) and to examine spatial distributions for clustering .
this has itself generated a substantial literature ( see the papers in elliot 1988 for an overview ) and is nowhere better exemplified than in openshaw 's geographical analysis machine ( see ch. 2 ) .
we then search retrospectively for evidence of possible environmental associations .
an alternative approach is to begin by hypothesizing an environmental determinant of ill health and to collect data to test an explicit hypothesis .
if an association is suggested then we would want to collect data in other areas to assess the hypothesis further .
of course , these two approaches are not clear-cut in practice ; in many cases the hypotheses of interest will have themselves been generated by inductive mapping .
one example of an hypothesis which has been given serious attention in recent years is the possible link between electromagnetic fields generated by high-voltage power lines or supply cables and ill health .
some work ( perry et al. 1981 ) suggested associations with mental illness and suicide , while others ( e.g. wertheimer and leeper 1982 ) have examined links to various cancers , including leukaemias .
a good bibliography is provided in perry and pearl ( 1988 ) .
the central electricity generating board ( now privatized and split into two companies ) is funding a large-scale , 2-year project to assess links to childhood cancer , while another recently announced study aims to look at links to sudden infant death .
one obvious problem , with implications for any gis input , is that the effects are highly localized , with little measurable field effect more than a few dozen metres away from the route centre-lines .
accuracy of digital data collection ( either of the power lines or residential locations ) is paramount .
there seems to be a growing interest in examining associations between ill health and the geological environment .
gis work in this field ( e.g. matthews 1989 ) is reviewed later , but we note here the work of the applied geochemistry group at imperial college ( responsible for a series of atlases on regional geochemistry ) and the existence of a society for environmental geochemistry and health .
one area of recent debate concerns radon gas and its links to lung cancer .
this is taken very seriously in the usa , where the environmental protection agency estimates that 10 000â€“20 000 deaths from lung cancer each year are due to radon gas exposure .
estimates from scandinavia suggest that 10â€“30 per cent of such deaths are caused by exposure to radon ( richardson 1988 : 270â€“81 ) .
the gas is trapped in well-insulated houses and is produced by the decay of uranium in rocks and soil ; thus it has been measured at high concentrations in parts of cornwall and devon .
there are great difficulties in assessing health effects , however , since exposure varies greatly from house to house within small neighbourhoods .
carefully designed case-control studies are therefore required to measure the separate effect of radon exposure after controlling for smoking behaviour and other risk factors .
other health concerns which might merit attention by those involved in the regional research laboratory ( rrl ) initiative include air and water pollution .
the debate about lead pollution from vehicle exhaust emissions is well known ; less publicity has been given to pahs ( polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons ) , a product of combustion processes and known to be carcinogenic ( lioy and daisey 1987 ) .
research at the north west regional research laboratory ( nwrrl ) aims to create buffers around busy roads and junctions and to use data from the cancer registry to examine possible links between proximity to such sources of pollution and prevalence of lung cancer .
those with an interest in health and air pollution should note the availability of a very detailed database from the warren springs laboratory , containing details of smoke and sulphur dioxide emissions at a large number of sites in the uk .
the possible link between nitrates in water and stomach cancer is the subject of much debate ( beresford 1985 ) , as is the association between aluminium content and alzheimer 's disease .
the problems of assessing such links are , of course , huge , but there is scope for a contribution .
the role of gis in hazard management scenarios â€” examples
as we have already implied , gis has a role to play in all aspects of hazard research , from hazard monitoring , risk assessment and emergency planning to coping with an event and evaluating its consequences .
the examples described below illustrate all these , though as yet there do not appear to be many instances of disasters in the management of which gis has played a significant part .
technological hazards , emergency planning and gis
a considerable amount of research has been undertaken to apply gis methods to evacuation scenarios around hazardous sites .
much of this research has concentrated on network analysis of the road system .
reference was made above to so-called cimah sites , major hazardous installations for which on-site and off-site emergency plans must be prepared .
early research at the nwrrl focused on developing a gis for use by the police and county emergency planning officers in cumbria that would aid in the management of a possible explosion at a chemical factory in whitehaven , west cumbria ( vincent et al. 1988 ; dunn 1989 ) .
the police required a portable system that could be implemented on an ibm-compatible microcomputer .
this was written at the nwrrl using fortran 77 and the graphical kernel system .
the gis is menu-based and is exceptionally user-friendly ( pl. 10.1 ) .
it opens with an outline map and the superimposition of the rather rigid zones used by the emergency planners .
full zoom facilities are available at any stage .
in any emergency it is of course vital to have high-quality data on the distribution of population and resources .
the system incorporates digitized data on the distribution of all domestic and non-domestic properties in the town together with digitized road centre-line data .
both sets of data were provided by pinpoint analysis ltd , who are undertaking this digitizing task for the entire country .
other spatially referenced data incorporated into the system include those on the distribution of schools , medical and transport services which can be displayed and supplementary information about them obtained .
the gis permits population estimates to be made for any arbitrary rectangular region on the map .
most significantly , it incorporates a shortest path algorithm which uses the road network to find optimal routes between user-defined start and end nodes .
although predating the rrl initiative by several years â€” and , indeed the emergence of gis as a major research area â€” we should remind ourselves of openshaw 's work on appraising nuclear reactor sites .
using what would now be called gis skills , openshaw ( 1980 ) examined over 13 000 1 km grid squares in the uk which intersect the coastline and related these to data from the 1971 census ( which were made available for such grid squares ) .
he demonstrated that there is an abundance of â€˜ remote â€™ sites , in contrast to the official view that such sites were increasingly hard to find .
he suggested that in early spatial searches for sites â€˜ only a small number were ever identified in the first place because rigorous searches could not be performed by manual means with poor quality data â€™ ( openshaw 1980 : 289 ) .
heywood and cornelius ( 1989 ) have shown how gis can be used for monitoring possible radiation releases and thus the relevance of gis in nuclear emergency planning and monitoring .
they propose a national radiological spatial information system and , in a pilot project in cumbria , have integrated several layers of data within arc/info to show what this might involve ( fig. 10.2 ) .
such data include those from the population and agricultural censuses as well as point data from rain gauge sites and radiation monitoring stations .
as an example , the system is used to determine restriction zones for the movement of sheep after the explosion at chernobyl in 1986 .
this is done by finding areas of high rainfall and parishes with high sheep populations .
the map overlay of point and area information shows generally good agreement with the restriction zones imposed by the ministry of agriculture , fisheries and food , with the exception of a small area to the south-east of cumbria , bordering on lancashire .
the british government carried out a review of its arrangements for handling nuclear accidents overseas following the chernobyl accident .
the doe , through her majesty 's inspectorate of pollution ( hmip ) , was given the task of co-ordinating a national response plan , installing the radiation monitoring network and acting as lead government department in an emergency ( hmso 1988 ) .
the monitoring network has become known as the radioactive incident monitoring network ( rimnet ) and has , as its prime responsibility , the detection of abnormal increases in radiation levels within the uk of the kind that might arise from an overseas nuclear accident .
the full implementation of the rimnet system will take some time .
by the end of 1988 gamma radiation dose monitors had been installed at 46 meteorological stations as part of phase 1 of the development programme .
radiation readings are taken every hour at each station and are transmitted to a central computer which analyses the data .
the current criterion for alert is two readings of more than three times normal background , either successively at the same site or simultaneously at two adjacent sites .
the dissemination of information in the event of an incident is dealt with at three levels : the first is the normal system of press notices ; the second is the use of teletext and viewdata ( ceefax and prestel ) to get direct to members of the public at their homes or places of work ; the third is the use of telecom gold electronic mail to get more technical details to various official bodies , such as water authorities ( jackson 1989 ) .
phase 2 of the rimnet scheme will be completed by the end of 1991 when between 80 and 90 monitoring sites will have been established .
given very wide regional and local variations in deposition , questions must be raised about the effectiveness of such a small network ; local authorities will need to supplement it with their own networks .
there are important analytical problems to be addressed concerning the siting of such monitoring equipment and these are elaborated on later .
abroad , kaspar ( 1981 ) has discussed a computer-based exercise , with gis overtones , involving the simulated evacuation of the population living in the vicinity of the neckarwestheim nuclear power plant in baden wã¼rttemberg .
in the scenario he outlines , an area affected by radioactive releases is determined , the population within that area is allocated to reception areas ( with capacity constraints ) , evacuation routes are identified and traffic restrictions implemented .
little detail is provided , however , and it is thus difficult to evaluate his work fully .
dangermond ( 1985 ) describes the use of the arc/info network module for use in emergency planning situations .
he describes how a road network is digitized and subsequently analysed using allocation , districting and routeing algorithms .
allocation determines which arcs in the network will be allocated to a particular node or centre ; districting makes it possible to outline rapidly sets of polygons in order to define specific areas of interest ( districts ) and to summarize their characteristics ; routeing provides a minimum path algorithm through the network , the arcs of which can be assigned weights according to road conditions , road capacity and so on .
dangermond gives several examples in his paper including the use of network for the allocation of emergency vehicles , optimum routeing of fire engines from garages to the accident scene and the movement of spills through sewers and river networks .
when combined with the other facilities in arc/info , quite complex disaster management scenarios can be handled .
for example , earthquake fault zones can be combined with data on housing density and structural details to predict earthquake damage levels and these data then related to the network model .
vincent ( 1989 ) illustrates the use of arc/info and its network module for finding safe routes for chlorine transhipment on the road and rail systems of north-west england ( pl. 10.2 ) .
in this case , population density data for a 1 km buffer on either side of network arcs were overlaid on the network itself so as to act as weights for the minimum path algorithm .
chosen routes were those which minimized population rather than distance .
hazardous waste disposal
there can be little doubt that a gis approach has wide applicability in all sorts of location problems where the goal is to minimize ( rather than , as conventionally , maximize ) accessibility to a population .
a particularly good application is to the search for potential sites for the disposal of nuclear and non-nuclear ( but none the less hazardous ) wastes .
we discuss here some relevant work on the siting of facilities for the disposal of nuclear wastes before examining those for non-nuclear wastes .
the major contribution to informed debate about the search for sites for the disposal of nuclear wastes has come from a group of geographers ( openshaw et al. 1989 ) and a gis approach to this problem can pay high dividends .
the work of carver ( see openshaw et al. 1989 : ch. 7 ) is an interesting example .
one advantage is the ability to model a range of alternatives by allowing particular criteria to enter or be omitted from the polygon overlay operation .
conceptually , what is offered is little more than an automated â€˜ sieve mapping â€™ that land-use planners have used for many years , but the whole procedure is speeded up by many orders of magnitude using gis software .
the authors examine both near-surface sites and deep repositories ( which use more restricted population criteria and allow offshore locations to enter ) .
data layers include geological maps , conservation areas , transport routes , petrochemical facilities and demographic data .
as different layers are added sequentially we see how the proportion of available land shrinks ( pl. 10.3 ) ; for instance , when geological criteria are set in the search for a deep repository , 25 per cent of land area remains and the addition of the population density layer reduces this to 24 per cent .
however , adding a proximity to transport constraint lowers this to 12 per cent ; and so on .
we can not pretend gis is a solution to the political problems of negotiation and justification but at the very least the openness of the procedures goes some way towards satisfying a worried public .
gis research into site selection for non-nuclear hazardous waste has been almost exclusively conducted in north america and has yet to be matched in the uk .
jensen and christiansen ( 1986 ) , working in the south-eastern usa , use a raster approach ( with a pixel resolution of 20 m&sup2 ; ) and boolean overlay to â€˜ weed out â€™ particular sites , such as those which are poorly drained , environmentally sensitive or inaccessible ( see also stewart 1987 ) .
environmental monitoring of sites for the disposal of toxic waste is of particular concern in the usa .
the comprehensive environmental response , compensation and liability act ( cercla ) legislation of 1980 ( â€˜ superfund â€™ ) requires the cleaning up of the worst landfill sites , of which some 800 had been identified by the environmental protection agency by 1986 ( foresman 1986 ) .
a major worry has been the threat posed by groundwater pollution and some research has been conducted on using gis to monitor this ( merchant et al. 1987 ; barringer et al. 1987 ; von braun 1988 ) .
this is an important topic since 95 per cent of rural households in the usa consume only groundwater , while half the us population consumes at least some groundwater ( merchant et al. 1987 ) .
clearly , the research demands access to exceptionally good environmental data , usually in three dimensions .
as foresman ( 1986 ) suggests , we might expect remote sensing technology to play a major role .
merchant et al. ( 1987 ) for example , use the image processing system erdas to construct an index of vulnerability to groundwater pollution ; this uses variables such as depth to water table , soil type , slope and so on ( see estes et al. 1987 for a similar approach ) .
barringer et al. ( 1987 ) overlay data on soil type and geology with that of groundwater quality ( hardness and corrosivity measures ) and build a linear model which shows that the background environmental variables are good predictors of the water quality indices .
again , a raster-based approach is used .
a further example is work by von braun ( 1988 ) who uses pmap to look at exposure of organic and metallic compounds in groundwater in the vicinity of tucson airport , arizona .
using plume models that predict the movement of contaminants she is able to intersect the results with data on current well locations and to assess which water supply areas are worst contaminated .
overlaying the results with residential location data provides â€˜ maps delineating location-specific exposures for each residence in each time-period â€™ ( von braun 1988 ; 1160 ) .
in principle , it is then possible to compare such â€˜ doses â€™ with epidemiological data , once again indicating a link from a hazard event to assessment of health outcomes .
attention should be drawn to foresman 's comment that the us geological survey ( usgs ) ( at the eros data centre ) have successfully linked arc/info to a model of groundwater flow ( foresman 1986 : 260 ) .
this kind of link between gis and other modelling programs is to be warmly welcomed and parallels work at the nwrrl in linking gis and air pollution plume models .
natural hazards and disaster management
several studies in recent papers have shown the effectiveness of gis in mitigating the effects of major natural hazards .
berke and ruch ( 1985 ) , for example , describe a gis for assessing the impacts of hurricanes on the texas gulf coast .
hurricane damage through high winds and tidal surges causes an immense amount of destruction and poses a major threat to many coastal communities in the usa .
it has been estimated , for example , that during the mid 1970s some 50 million us citizens were subject to hurricane winds of over 160 km/h and 6 million were subject to hurricane surge ( brinkman 1975 ) .
the system described by berke and ruch ( 1985 ) is raster-based and has an interesting modelling component called slosh ( sea , lake and overland surges from hurricanes ) .
slosh is able to estimate still water surge by grid cell for various hurricane intensities , angles of approach to the shoreline , forward movement speeds and landfall locations .
additional algorithms are used to model total building damage costs for each grid cell based on water-depth and speed-depth rating curves .
hobeika and jamei ( 1985 ) describe the massevacuation ( massvac ) simulation software designed to analyse and evaluate traffic evacuation plans given a natural disaster in an urban area .
the system comprises three interrelated modules : community and disaster type characteristics module ; population distribution module ; network evacuation module .
the type of natural disaster determines the time period within which the road network has to be evacuated .
the control and management strategies are directly correlated to each specific disaster scenario .
massvac is quite flexible and various user-defined road network options are available such as : traffic signal timings on the road network ; one-way traffic ; reserved lanes for special vehicles such as those of the emergency services .
hobeika and jamei have tested massvac on various evacuation scenarios for virginia beach city in order to determine evacuation times for flood and hurricane conditions .
in general , they suggest that the model provided reasonable and reliable evacuation times .
southworth et al. ( 1989 ) have enhanced the massvac model with the addition of a colour graphics module which they call mvopl .
this module has been developed using ibm 's graphics kernel system and provides a number of display screens .
the most interesting are those which portray population flows as scaled ribbons on the network diagram , and evacuation shelter capacities as bar diagrams .
the diagrams are updated periodically during the course of the simulation .
in dry parts of the world , such as australia , forest and bush fires are an important natural hazard and some attention has been given to the ways in which gis might help examine their potential impacts .
kessell ( 1988 ) describes a pc-based gis called preplan ( pristine environment planning language ) which is a natural area management , land-use planning and fire modelling system developed for the australian national parks and wildlife service , preplan comprises four modules : a simple raster-based gis ; a grid cell resource database ; a wide range of vegetation , fuel , fire behaviour , erosion and land-use models ; tabular , statistical and colour graphics output system .
with this system real-time fire growth can be modelled , taking into account changes in terrain , fuel and temporal changes in the weather .
kessell points out that uncontrollable fires are recurrent phenomena in many parts of australia , causing damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars and significant loss of life .
systems such as preplan can provide the user with sound models of the behaviour patterns of fire and are therefore of enormous value in land-use planning .
one of the most widespread natural hazards is flooding , and the potential for loss of property , risk to life and general social disruption is large .
one interesting example of a gis approach to flood damage estimation is the anuflood package which was developed in the early 1980s following detailed flood damage studies for flood-prone coastal towns in northern new south wales , australia ( smith and greenaway , 1988 ) .
the anuflood system requires locational and building type data on individual properties , stage-damage curves relating the average damage that would result from overfloor flooding to differing depths for each property type , and lastly , flood frequency in terms of flood height expressed as a probability .
output from the system is both tabular and graphical .
of particular interest is the construction of maps showing the expected annual amounts of damage for gridded flood-prone areas .
anuflood also contains modules which permit the investigation of various flood damage mitigation options , such as property height raising , levee construction and flood proofing .
environmental epidemiology
the possibilities sketched above relate to emergency planning , the search for hazardous sites , and risk assessment .
to what extent can gis help if an event occurs ?
what , for instance , of the health consequences ?
there is a rich tradition of epidemiological work in geography and with the increasing availability of spatially referenced medical data the scope for gis applications is wide ( gatrell 1987 ) .
for instance , diggle et al. ( 1990 ) assess the hypothesis that cancer of the larynx is associated with proximity to a now-closed incinerator and develop a statistical model from the theory of spatial point processes to test this .
this would have been impossible without the link provided from postcoded data ( increasingly available from sources such as cancer registries ) to ordnance survey ( os ) grid references .
such a link is provided by the central postcode directory , which matches all 1.5 million unit postcodes in the uk to grid references .
when the cases of laryngeal cancer are compared with a null distribution ( provided by the distribution of much more common lung cancer ) the hypothesis is given strong support .
although the proposed method is novel , it is but one of an increasingly large number of methods designed to detect and model â€˜ clusters â€™ of disease ( see , for example , cuzick and edwards 1990 ) .
the work of diggle et al. ( 1990 ) examined only a single point source , though it generalizes to multiple sources and to linear hazards as well .
as a second example of health work linked to hazard studies we may cite the research being conducted by cross ( 1989 ) on childhood leukaemia .
there are numerous hypotheses concerning the aetiology of this disease ( from ionizing radiation to viral transmission ) and cross 's approach is to collect digital data designed to test some of these hypotheses and to use arc/info to display and analyse results .
for instance , one hypothesis concerns the role of electromagnetic radiation , a source of which is overhead high-voltage transmission lines as noted earlier .
if these are digitized and buffer zones constructed around them ( fig. 10.3 ) we can quite easily test hypotheses about prevalence in such buffer zones as compared with prevalence outside .
however , we should bear in mind the earlier point about the resolution of the data , since such electromagnetic effects have a very weak effect beyond perhaps 50 m ( wertheimer and leeper 1982 ) .
there has been a suspicion for many years that high rates of stomach cancer in parts of wales may be linked to soil chemistry , specifically such factors as zinc/copper ratios , and to lead content in water supplies .
matthews ( 1989 ) has used data from the regional cancer registry ( morbidity rather than mortality data ) and data on trace elements to examine this link .
since the latter are available for a 5 km raster the registration data are assigned to these grid squares using the os grid reference .
as with any such study there are the usual problems of ecological analysis and influences of migration , together with issues of separating out the risk factors under investigation from possible confounding factors .
in the usa , morrill 's report on the beginnings of a $15m. study into the possible radiation doses received as result of radiation releases by the hanford ( washington state ) nuclear complex would seem to cry out for gis skills to be applied ( morrill 1989 ) .
the research project will employ plume dispersion models in order to model dispersal by wind and will need to integrate this and other environmental data with detailed demographic records .
to some extent this line of approach was anticipated by johnson ( 1981 ) in his study of exposure to plutonium fall-out from the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant near denver ( see zeigler et al. 1983 : 47â€“8 ) .
using soil samples he constructed a contoured risk surface and then mapped excess cancers in various distance bands , detecting a marked distance decay effect .
research problems and prospects
the work reviewed above suggests that the application of gis techniques to hazard assessment , emergency planning and environmental monitoring is both actually and potentially an important research area with many challenging problems .
undoubtedly , the giss of the 1990s will look very different from their rather primitive ancestors .
computer power is becoming cheaper , digital data more readily available , and giss are becoming hybrid systems involving other technologies .
in this last section we highlight some important research areas as we see them .
doubtless there are many others , such is the surge of interest in gis technology .
data availability
we should first consider the availability and quality of data concerning the populations who may be at risk from the storage and transport of hazardous substances , from toxic air pollution , from flooding and so on .
such data are crucial , either for assisting the emergency services to make assessments about resources they need to deploy in such events , or for high-quality estimates to be made of risk .
within the public domain in the uk we must rely in general on data from the most recent population census , the lowest level being that for enumeration districts ( eds ) .
as is well known ( rhind 1983 ) these contain on average perhaps 150â€“200 households and 400â€“500 people .
the boundaries eds have not been widely digitized , unlike the higher-level electoral wards .
however , the centroids of eds are available as 100 m grid references and artificial ed â€˜ polygons â€™ can be created if necessary .
in some instances such data will suffice ; in many cases they will have to suffice as nothing better is available .
but in some areas eds are very extensive physical units and the shapes will be quite distorted .
furthermore , the scales at which population estimates are often required means that even eds are too coarse for risk assessments .
for instance , in performing its quantitative risk assessments the health and safety executive will rarely deal with distances from hazardous sites in excess of 1 km ( petts 1988 ) and census data will not offer sufficient resolution for accurate population estimates to be made .
it should be pointed out , however , that the national radiological protection board currently uses 1 km grid square resolution population data from the 1971 census in its radiological protection studies ( hallam et al. 1981 ) .
it would seem that , despite the costs involved , they should consider investing in the very detailed digital data ( pinpoint address code ( pac ) ) provided by pinpoint analysis ltd .
this area of application would appear to be an obvious market for such a product .
a useful research exercise would be to compare the use of census and pac data in deriving quantitative risk assessments and this is an interesting research problem .
even with pac data some assumptions would need to be made about numbers of persons per household if good population estimates were to be made .
more generally , we need to consider the availability of large databases for hazard studies and emergency planning and this is an area ripe for major initiatives .
in the uk we seem to be lagging well behind the usa in the construction of databases on hazardous sites and especially hazard events such as those involving toxic releases .
for instance , lioy and daisey ( 1987 ) , in their work on the monitoring of toxic air pollution in new jersey , construct what they term a â€˜ microinventory â€™ for each of three towns , comprising the locations of chemical plants , metal processing plants , paint spray manufacturers and so on .
some attribute information is available for these .
more closely linked to gis is work by mcmaster and johnson ( 1986 ) who perform a very detailed inventory of hazardous materials ( both stored and transported ) in santa monica , california .
although the raster displays are very crude it is simple to answer spatial queries concerning the locations of people ( for instance , particular age groups ) within certain distances of toxic hazard sites .
we have data on some hazardous sites ( e.g. those regulated by cimah ) in the uk but a much more comprehensive approach should be adopted , especially if we are serious in the search for environmental associations with chronic diseases .
the same is true for toxic releases .
in the usa the environmental protection agency produces an acute hazards events database while the department of transportation has a database recording details of 25 000 releases of toxic materials ; such details include locational information , type and amount of material released , mode of release and resulting injuries or deaths ( cutter and solecki 1989 ) .
can we not use gis technology to construct â€˜ risk mosaics â€™ ( zeigler et al. 1983 ) , at a variety of spatial scales , akin to hewitt and burton 's â€˜ hazardousness â€™ of a place ?
in the uk only a handful of county emergency planning departments ( cumbria , for instance ) have built up resource databases in digital form and this needs to be promoted .
further afield , we need to recognize that some disasters ( most obviously chernobyl ) will have implications for more than one country so that environmental monitoring should take place with some kind of international co-ordination .
there will also be movements of hazardous cargoes across frontiers and there are clearly problems of risk assessment and planning for emergencies at or near international boundaries , or at sea and airports .
as noted above , the work of fedra ( 1989 ) is a major step in this direction , and links need to be forged between initiatives in the uk and the rest of europe .
in terms of databases on hazardous wastes , attention has already been drawn to the waste disposal plans prepared by wras .
these give details of present site locations and some indication of permitted wastes , though little or no information on closed and abandoned sites .
however , for details of disposal the individual site licences must be consulted .
the former hazardous waste inspectorate operated a large database on all sites , with details of permitted wastes , including allowable quantities .
the database was created by a commercial company , aspinwalls ltd .
there are numerous potentially usable databases for environmental epidemiological work .
opcs , of course , is a major data repository for medical statistics and their various monitor series are of use , though only at the scale of district health authority and above ( see gatrell and lovett 1988 for an example ) .
regional health authorities will from time to time produce mortality data at ward level .
however , if cancers are of interest it is more appropriate to obtain data from regional cancer registries ; these data are morbidity rather than mortality data and are therefore more valuable .
the data are postcoded and may have some occupational details .
for example , we have received data from the regional cancer registry in manchester comprising all cancers of the larynx and lung notified between 1974 and 1984 .
this large data set , to which grid references have now been added , comprises information about nearly 40 000 individuals .
it has now been copied into ingres , a relational database management system , permitting queries to be made about subsets of the data ; for instance , all males between the ages of 25 and 64 suffering from laryngeal cancer .
other data sources on cancers are independent registries of malignancies .
an example is that on leukaemias , managed by the leukaemia research fund centre in leeds ( alexander et al. 1989 ) .
it should be noted that there are frequently major discrepancies between the regional registries and the specialist registries , partly because the latter receive notifications directly from consultants .
indeed , working directly with consultants proves invaluable in gaining access to high-quality morbidity data .
two other potential sources of data are worth mentioning .
first , attention should be drawn to the new directive from the department of health to regional and district health authorities to review the health of the population .
this means in practice that district medical officers are charged with preparing an annual report , presenting and interpreting epidemiological data , identifying local health problems and evaluating service outcomes .
lancaster university is already heavily involved in the work of preston district health authority in this area .
second , family health service authorities ( fhsas ) , are also required to take on these roles , but from the viewpoint of primary health care services .
fhsas ( which correspond to non-metropolitan counties and to metropolitan boroughs ) hold large databases on services provided by general practitioners ; for instance , uptake of immunization and screening for breast and cervical cancers .
is it , we wonder , possible to contemplate bringing together some of these data sources to form a national online health information system ( nohis ) , to parallel that for employment and unemployment ( townsend et al. 1987 ) ?
this might include data on morbidity and mortality , uptake of preventative medicine , service use and availability , at both primary and hospital level .
it would be a useful management tool , particularly in view of the reorganization taking place in the national health service .
it should not be forgotten that hazards themselves have geographical distributions yet there has been little effort in the uk to develop public domain databases .
are there hazard-prone areas ?
is there a regional differentiation in hazard type ?
these are , of course , commercially important questions and a good deal of money is going into the collection of such data by insurance companies .
one well known database is major hazard incident data service ( mhidas ) global industrial hazards database which is currently being developed by the safety and reliability directorate on behalf of the major hazards assessment unit of the uk health and safety directorate .
this system currently runs in dbase ii and contains in excess of 3000 items of professionally assessed information on major hazards coded into some 24 separate fields .
unfortunately , the spatial referencing is poor and with some effort this could easily be remedied .
it is , for example , little use when recording a chemical spill into an egyptian river to have entered into the appropriate field â€˜ the nile â€™ â€” after all , this river is some 6480 km long !
here , in our view , is a classic case of the absence of a geographical input rendering the data of limited value .
in some cases , good hazard data exist but have simply not yet found their way into a gis .
a case in point is inland and coastal flooding .
most river authorities have detailed maps showing the geographical limits of floods in relation to their return periods .
within the next decade , as the privatized water companies develop their gis , we shall see a massive amount of data conversion in this area .
this development , together with the availability of digital terrain models , will allow quite sophisticated flood forecasting models to be developed within a gis framework .
as sea-levels rise in the next 20â€“30 years due to the â€˜ greenhouse â€™ effect , this very practical use of gis technology is likely to become commonplace and of considerable practical importance .
spatial statistics
another way in which there needs to be a rapprochement between statistical methods and gis is in the area of spatial sampling and estimation from spatial samples .
this is clearly an important issue in radiation monitoring as the discussion of rimnet above implies .
as an example , peirson ( 1988 ) has reviewed the evidence on artificial radioactivity in cumbria and shows maps of the distribution of certain radionuclides as contoured surfaces .
the point worth making here is that there are many alternative schemes for interpolating from irregular point data ( lam 1983 ) .
one method in particular , kriging ( now available as part of the uniras software ) , offers not only a contoured surface but also an estimate of the standard error at any point on the map .
where this is high it suggests that an additional sampling station might be set up .
such techniques are now standard in environmental science ( see streit 1981 for an application to rainfall monitoring ) and need to be promoted vigorously in hazard studies ( estes et al. 1987 ) .
related to this problem is that of making population estimates for new zones that result from overlay operations .
we may want to count numbers living within plumes , circles of fixed radius , buffer zones and so on .
existing gis techniques usually base the estimates on area-weighted shares , so that a new polygon created by â€˜ slicing â€™ an existing area in half is assigned half the population of that source unit .
this may be quite absurd in some cases , notably where population is spatially clustered within a physically large ed .
at the nwrrl work is under way ( flowerdew and green 1989 ) to solve such problems using the em algorithm and the statistical modelling package glim , which has been interfaced with arc/info .
operations research methods and simulation
while there is some research activity in linking statistical models to gis there would seem to be scope for further applications of operations research techniques to gis problems .
within some sophisticated gis such as arc/info there are some useful algorithms ( such as shortest path calculations ) , but gis developers have in general failed to realize the natural links between gis functions and many operations research techniques .
over the last 20 years or so a large theoretical literature has been developed to provide tools for the solution of many problems associated with emergency planning ( kolesar 1981 ) .
one important class of problems is the selection of locations for the emergency service units .
the choice of locations need not be for permanent bases , but can also include dynamic repositioning of units as circumstances dictate ( kolesar and walker 1974 ) .
in any major emergency a typical problem is the assignment of resources to demands .
if resources are held at one set of locations and the demands are at another and the costs of transportation are known , how do we allocate the resources most efficiently ?
in a major emergency , for example , there might be a need to supply blood products held at regional blood banks to hospitals .
this , of course , is the classic transportation problem and its solution is well known .
as far as we know the microcomputer-based emergency response system devised by belardo et al. ( 1983 ) , is the only gis-like software to incorporate this algorithm .
in this system , the solution to the transportation problem is shown graphically on the road network , which is displayed on the computer screen .
as a last example of the potential role of operations research in gis and disaster management we are reminded of the logistic problems that faced the peel regional police force during the mississauga evacuation mentioned previously ( scanlon and padgham 1980 ) .
during the early states of the phased evacuation the logistical problem facing the police was the street-by-street warning of the population to make ready for evacuation .
speed was of the essence and manpower was limited .
here , then , is a familiar operations research network problem : all roads have to be traversed such that the journey length/time is a minimum .
this is the so-called chinese postman problem , which provides a hamiltonian circuit through the arcs ( as compared with the travelling salesman problem which is a minimum route through the network nodes ) .
grant 's remains were shovelled into a canvas bag .
tense , facing outwards , forster , lawton and nell guarded delaney as he intoned the seaman 's prayer of interment , and then committed the canvas bag to the ocean .
the storm was abating rapidly , the evening sky clearing in the west with the golden rays of the setting sun adding a dying colour to the sullen slate blue water .
the whiteness of the canvas body-bag dimmed beneath the onrushing sea , faded at the edges , then grew smaller , greener , and was gone .
they returned to the bridge , fearful of every dark place â€” every corner , every door .
the gangway lamps seemed to give no light , only add further to the gloom of the dusk .
back in the wheelhouse , delaney faced them .
â€˜ right .
you all know the score .
as i see it we 've got two choices .
one , we get out of here now .
launch the lifeboat , take our chances , or â€¦ two , we go after whatever it is . â€™
nobody spoke immediately .
finally forster glanced at lawton for support , and drawled laconically .
â€˜ i 'm not leaving here until we 've done for that bastard .
it 's personal from now on in ! â€™
lawton nodded his agreement .
â€˜ yes , â€™ he said , â€˜ i feel the same . â€™
â€˜ nell ? â€™
delaney asked , looking at her squarely .
â€˜ i agree , â€™ she said without hesitation .
their tense , edgy faces watched delaney closely .
â€˜ we do n't know what we 're up against , â€™ delaney said , â€˜ so let's proceed with maximum caution . â€™
â€˜ trouble is , â€™ lawton said , with a frown , â€˜ there are n't enough of us to search the ship .
it can work its way past us , and hide again .
we could still be looking for it when they blow us out of the water . â€™
â€˜ that 's why we 've got to take risks , â€™ nell put in .
â€˜ lure it into a trap , somehow .
and quickly .
forster 's chuckle was mirthless .
â€˜ i do n't think this joker is going to need much encouragement . â€™
â€˜ no . â€™
delaney was momentarily thoughtful .
â€˜ what had you in mind , nell ? â€™
she pointed to the figure of a man propped in the corner , and the cylinders of oxygen in the back pack lying beside it .
â€˜ two of our number have been killed .
each time when they were on their own .
let's give it the same conditions , only this time we use that as the bait . â€™
they looked at the â€˜ man â€™ forster had found .
it was a safety suit , an advanced model of the nbc type with its own oxygen tanks .
â€˜ one in ambush , with the rest of us acting like beaters .
start at one end of the ship , making as much noise as possible . â€™
forster grunted .
â€˜ it had no trouble finding grant .
i think it 's a good idea .
and i 'll go in the suit until we reach the ambush point .
might help to draw it . â€™
they helped him kit up , nell connecting the leads from the back pack into the suit attachments .
forster 's breathing whistled out of the one-way valve .
behind the clear , wide vizor , he tried to smile .
â€˜ cosy in here , â€™ he joked .
â€˜ even got my own toilet .
bloody handy in the circumstances . â€™
delaney took the lead .
it was now light , the lamps on the gangway giving murky yellow pools that barely pushed back the inky blackness of a starless night .
at the entrance to the laboratory complex the others drew on their own masks .
ineffectual or not against lingering gases it seemed a wise precaution , even if it was only psychological .
delaney glanced back at them .
â€˜ let's make sure it knows where we are . â€™
they made noise ; slammed doors .
nell shuddered .
were unseen eyes watching them ?
was it even now shadowing them , moving soundlessly from cover to cover , like a tiger in the steel jungle ?
forster 's radio-projected voice broke into her thoughts .
â€˜ looks a good place . â€™
he was at the entrance to the secure lab zone .
â€˜ this must be the only way in , â€™ nell said .
forster was quickly de-suited .
as they set up the now empty suit with its back to the door , half slumped over a control panel , he settled down behind the curtained entrance of the showers .
delaney 's voice was hushed .
â€˜ maybe we should leave two of us here ? â€™
â€˜ do n't want to rouse any suspicions .
forster was adamant .
â€˜ after all , it might be able to count . â€™
when he did n't get any response , he patted the uzi beside him on the steel floor .
â€˜ i wo n't be unprepared like poor old grant . â€™
delaney pulled the curtain across , covering forster who cut a small slit in the opaque green plastic , widening it to give himself a better field of view .
lawton came and crouched down in front of it .
â€˜ i 've left the suit 's radio on full , â€™ he said .
â€˜ make it sound interesting if we talk occasionally . â€™
he hesitated .
â€˜ good luck . â€™
â€˜ i feel like a maharajah waiting for the tiger to pounce on the tied-up goat , â€™ forster grinned .
â€˜ i hope i do n't have to wait all night . â€™
nell shuddered .
night .
this was a night in their minds â€” a creature from the darker side of man 's intellect .
something worried her about that thought .
something hidden behind the more obvious sentiment .
after they 'd gone , forster felt the silence physically settle around him .
he 'd never been one to exercise an over-imagination , yet the conditions were like the feeling of a tomb â€” of an interment .
would he be found , he mused , a thousand years from then , a dust-covered skeleton ?
he chuckled .
and the uzi a primitive weapon , the bio suit mistaken for some sort of ceremonial armour ?
the first stunning silence gave way to the creaking of the ship and a far-off booming of the sea against the hull .
the radio on the dummy suddenly screeched into action as delaney 's distorted voice gave it life .
the thousands of tons of steel made real communication impossible .
his own radio was off .
forster settled down , only putting his eye to the slit every half minute , not continually as he had started to do .
he had a good view of the long shadowy main corridor .
the only problem was if â€” he corrected himself â€” when it came , which side turning , if any , would it use .
the further away the better .
the more time to see it approach .
the trouble was the transverse corridor just outside the room .
if the approach was that way he would get no warning at all , and it would be on top of george â€” his name for the dummy sitting like a drunken son-of-a-bitch â€” before he knew it .
if that happened , he 'd have to work fast .
what he 'd seen done to grant made forster realise that whatever it was struck with demonic speed and savagery .
in seconds , poor old george would be spread around the room like an explosion in harrod 's window , and the thing would be away .
or on him .
as if in protest , george uttered a blood-curdling , lunatic-sounding cackle , and fell fractionally forward .
forster suppressed a nervous giggle .
they reached the main deck , dropping down
in a defensive posture , eyes searching the stacked containers , trying to probe the black , jagged recesses between them .
lawton scanned upwards .
â€˜ it could be anywhere .
even back on the bridge again . â€™
â€˜ we should start in the engine room , â€™ nell suggested , shivering , â€˜ work up through the crew 's quarters , and then into the complex . â€™
confronted with the need to proceed ,
delaney took risks , plummeting feet first through the hatchways , and partly breaking his descent with the handrails , falling like a parachutist , rolling instantly deploying his uzi against â€¦
against what ?
like forster , all he could guess was that it was fast .
grant may have been lame , but â€¦ fast or silent ?
or both ?
the speed of descent must have cut down the exposure to any residual gas since he felt none of the earlier weirdness as he approached the still sealed engine room door .
pandora 's box ?
he winced at the memory as he hammered on the steel and then looked through the spy port .
in the stroboscopic view , the giant pistons were the only things moving â€” until a figure detached itself from the wall , its grey colour exactly that of the background steel .
like a chameleon , it moved out of the aisle between machines , then stopped , and became utterly motionless .
delaney 's stillness caught the attention of the others .
nell 's transceivered voice crackled in his headphones .
â€˜ what is it ? â€™
he did n't want to take his eyes from it â€” equally he wanted somebody else to see it .
to confirm .
gently as though he might disturb it , he pulled back .
â€˜ take a look for yourself . â€™
she did â€” and caught her breath .
the creature was large-headed , absurdly so , its body half man , half something lost in the primordial past .
but there could be no doubt that fundamentally it was â€¦ human .
nell knew , and not only because she was a female of the same species .
she could see in its eyes â€” intelligence .
and human fear .
but also , as a doctor , she knew exactly what it was .
she told delaney , who shook his head with revulsion .
nell would never rest until she could get closer to confirm her worst suspicions , and paradoxically it was the woman in her that provided the intensity of emotion that would let nothing stand in her way .
george , the sacrificial dummy , had n't emitted a squeak for a long time .
forster scanned the corridor once more .
it was empty .
just as it always had been .
he sat back again , eyeing the blank wall before him , confident that he 'd catch it , however good it was .
he kept wondering how it had got silk .
silk was the meanest , toughest professional he 'd ever known .
and yet he 'd disappeared , without trace .
forster was a fatalist .
he shrugged .
you could be james bond , he thought , but if something had your number on it â€¦
a gentle breeze broke the absolute silence , moving the curtain so that he had to steady it with his hand .
instantly alert , forster checked through his spy port .
nothing .
but a door had opened somewhere .
somebody , or something , had entered the complex .
it could be the others returning â€” or the start of his ambush .
â€˜ for god 's sake leave your mask on .
and that 's an order ! â€™
but delaney 's plea was in vain .
nell pulled it off , got close to the door , and shouted .
â€˜ we mean you no harm .
you can help us . â€™
when she checked through the spyhole it was standing in exactly the same spot , unmoving , like a lizard .
lawton shook his head .
â€˜ ca n't hear you .
try the ship 's system again . â€™
nell ran to the wall telephone , and pushed the digit for engine room .
the small light beneath the receiver rests showed that the line was working .
worried , delaney followed , searching her face , fearing the tell-tale signs of toxicity .
on impulse , and against his better judgment , he pulled off his own mask .
nell repeatedly pressed the button , shouted across at lawton , who was now using the spy port .
â€˜ what 's happening ? â€™
the back of lawton 's head shook , his radio-projected voice crackling .
â€˜ nothing now .
the head jerked , just the once , to the left , so i reckon it heard the â€˜ phone . â€™
he straightened up and came over , directing his question at delaney .
â€˜ we ought to get on . â€™
delaney nodded his agreement .
â€˜ leave it , nell . â€™
his tone was sharp .
â€˜ it 's not going anywhere . â€™
she squared up to him , defiantly ,
â€˜ i ca n't , john .
do n't you see ?
the poor thing is part of this madness .
if we can get to it , i can learn so much more .
and in any case , it might die if we do n't try and help it â€¦ soon . â€™
delaney averted his gaze from her , afraid of what he had seen in her eyes .
â€˜ perhaps it would be better if it did . â€™
â€˜ you do n't mean that , â€™ she said , stepping away from him .
delaney fiddled awkwardly with his mask , preparatory to putting it back on again .
â€˜ for god 's sake , nell .
all i mean is , we 've got a job to do .
and forster 's neck 's on the line .
do n't you owe it to him to come now ? â€™
she flushed , but held on to the â€˜ phone .
obviously striving to be as controlled as possible , she smiled .
â€˜ you two can manage , â€™ she said calmly .
â€˜ i can do better here , on my own .
quietly .
if i succeed it will unlock a lot of the mystery of what 's been done on titron .
and â€¦ â€™
she faltered .
â€˜ â€¦ i think we owe it to that pathetic creature in there . â€™
â€˜ pathetic ? â€™
delaney tried to play down the fear in his voice â€” fear for her .
â€˜ it might be bloody dangerous .
certainly , something on this ship is . â€™
â€˜ not this one , â€™ nell said , shaking her head with some kind of reassurance .
â€˜ i just know . â€™
lawton gestured in the gangway .
â€˜ you may not be at risk from what is in here .
what about out there ?
there 's no guarantee that what we 're hunting is going to follow the rules . â€™
nell shrugged .
â€˜ that 's a risk i 'll have to take .
i 've got a more important job here . â€™
delaney knew there was no way she would be shifted from her chosen course .
ordering her would be ludicrous under the changed circumstances , and in any event , a waste of time .
but lawton was right .
the risk from the other danger , or dangers of titron , frightened him more .
â€˜ help me secure the stairs behind us , â€™ he snapped at lawton , â€˜ as much as we can . â€™
delaney turned to nell .
â€˜ it might buy you the time you need .
but take care .
do n't be bloody foolish like i am , leaving you here .
establish contact if you can .
no more at this stage .
understand ?
and do n't try and get the door open . â€™
but nell was hardly listening .
to please him she nodded , then despite lawton 's presence , squeezed delaney 's arm .
â€˜ and you . â€™
she smiled .
â€˜ watch out . â€™
reluctantly , delaney made for the gangway .
lawton had already shifted some chairs , in readiness to form a barricade .
he gave him a hand with a large oil drum , and then another , as nell , tearing herself from her appointed task , dragged over a bench .
as they drew back up the stairs , piling on the pieces she threw up at them , lawton sniffed .
â€˜ this wo n't hold anything .
just slow it down . â€™
like forster before her , nell indicated her pistol and grenades .
â€˜ as long as there 's ti me , that 's all we need . â€™
as they descended the stairs , delaney paused , and took a last look down at her .
she smiled shyly , then turned away .
in a sense , as long as he could convince himself that she was safe , he was glad she was n't coming with them .
whatever it was they were after , it was an unknown quantity , unknown , that is , except for a lethal ferocity .
he pulled on his respirator , his mind made up to get back to her as soon as he could , for nell anderson was all he cared about now .
there it went again .
forster frowned as he looked through his spy hole .
a sound .
he could n't place it , but it reminded him strongly of something .
the corridor was empty .
it had happened three times now .
a hissing , we gas escaping , ending with a funny little squeak .
he looked at george , wondering if the sound had come from him .
satisfied that everything was as it should be , he checked his watch .
well over half an hour had passed .
they ought to be near him soon .
forster searched in a pouch and came up with a glucose sweet .
quietly he unwrapped the covering paper , then paused , as some instinct made him check again .
as he did so , the sound came nearer ; louder .
his intense scrutiny took in the shadowy and empty lengths of the corridor .
apart from some dark patches on the wall that he had n't noticed before , there was nothing to see .
his gaze came back to george , still sprawled over the control desk .
a fly landed on the empty , staring vizor , and crawled across it .
forster was sorely tempted to nip out and confirm that the noise was coming from george by twiddling the volume and tuner , but fought down the urge .
he sat back , pulled off his mask , and popped the sweet into his mouth .
it took him only seconds to notice the smell .
forster choked as the putrefying reek seemed to get right into him .
frightened that it was a gas pocket , he fumbled with his mask , and finally got it back on .
his heart was thumping .
nothing seemed to be happening , all his senses were apparently functioning normally , except â€¦ that the sweet in his mouth seemed permeated with the awful smell ; had become a slimy lump of filth .
he had to get rid of it .
forster reached for his mask , just as the hissing gas noise sounded right on top of him , ending with a little shriek .
he knew then where he 'd heard something similar before .
it was like a man breathing through a respiratory system , with some sort of one-way valve .
a shadow fell across the wall opposite , as slowly , and fearfully he turned .
the curtain was a dense , opaque greenish-yellow , and something was right behind it , a shape pressing against the humped plastic standing there looking down at him , half seen , half imagined .
his hand went out , reached for the submachine gun , his fingers tightening on the stock .
with a blood-curdling growl , the curtain was snatched aside .
forster half rolled , his uzi trembling in his hand as he got off half a clip at point blank range .
but it struck with the speed of an attacking snake .
and something else ; something he saw as the curtain tore away and he looked into the depths of the unbelievable face above him , fractionally dulled his reflexes .
friday 16 september to tuesday 20 september
once free of the knotted tentacles of the eastern suburbs , dalgliesh made good time and by three he was driving through lydsett village .
here a right turn took him off the coastal road on to what was little more than a smoothly macadamed track bordered by water-filled ditches and fringed by a golden haze of reeds , their lumbered heads straining in the wind .
and now , for the first time , he thought that he could smell the north sea , that potent but half-illusory tang evoking nostalgic memories of childhood holidays , of solitary adolescent walks as he struggled with his first poems , of his aunt 's tall figure at his side , binoculars round her neck , striding towards the haunts of her beloved birds .
and here , barring the road , was the familiar old farm gate still in place .
its continued presence always surprised him since it served no purpose that he could see except symbolically to cut off the headland and to give travellers pause to consider whether they really wanted to continue .
it swung open at his touch but closing it , as always , was more difficult and he lugged and half lifted it into place and slipped the circle of wire over the gatepost with a familiar sensation of having turned his back on the workaday world and entered country which , no matter how frequent his visits , would always be alien territory .
he was driving now across the open headland towards the fringe of pine trees which bordered the north sea .
the only house to his left was the old victorian rectory , a square , red-brick building , incongruous behind its struggling hedge of rhododendron and laurel .
to his right the ground rose gently towards the southern cliffs and he could see the dark mouth of a concrete pillbox , undemolished since the war , and as seemingly indestructible as the great hulks of wave-battered concrete , remnants of the old fortifications which lay half-submerged in the sand along part of the beach .
to the north the broken arches and stumps of the ruined benedictine abbey gleamed golden in the afternoon sun against the crinkled blue of the sea and , breasting a small ridge , he glimpsed for the first time the topsail of larksoken mill and beyond it , against the skyline , the great grey bulk of larksoken nuclear power station .
the road he was on , veering left , would lead eventually to the station but was , he knew , seldom used since normal traffic and all heavy vehicles used the new access road to the north .
the headland was empty and almost bare , the few straggling trees , distorted by the wind , struggled to keep their precarious hold in the uncompromising soil .
and now he was passing a second and more dilapidated pillbox and it struck him that the whole headland had the desolate look of an old battlefield , the corpses long since carted away but the air vibrating still with the gunfire of long-lost battles , while the power station loomed over it like a grandiose modern monument to the unknown dead .
on his previous visits to larksoken he had seen martyr 's cottage spread out beneath him when he and his aunt had stood surveying the headland from the small top room under the cone of the mill .
but he had never been closer to it than the road and now , driving up to it , it struck him again that the description â€˜ cottage â€™ was hardly appropriate .
it was a substantial , two-storey , l-shaped house standing to the east of the track with walls partly flint and partly rendered , enclosing at the rear a courtyard of york stone which gave an uninterrupted view over fifty yards of scrub to the grassy dunes and the sea .
no one appeared as he drew up and , before lifting his hand to the bell , he paused to read the words of a stone plaque embedded in the flints to the right of the door .
in a cottage on this site lived agnes poley , protestant martyr , burned at ipswich , 15th august 1557 , aged 32 years .
ecclesiastes chapter 3 , verse 15 .
the plaque was unadorned , the letters deeply carved in an elegant script reminiscent of eric gill , and dalgliesh remembered his aunt telling him that it had been placed there by previous owners in the late twenties , when the cottage was originally extended .
one of the advantages of a religious education is the ability to identify at least the better-known texts of scripture and this was one which it needed no effort of memory to recall .
as a delinquent nine-year-old at his prep school , he had once been required by the headmaster to write out in his best handwriting the whole of the third chapter of ecclesiastes , old gumboil , economical in this as in all matters , believing that writing lines should combine punishment with literary and religious education .
the words , in that round childish script , had remained with him .
it was , he thought , an interesting choice of text .
that which hath been is now ; and that which is to be hath already been ; and god requireth that which is past .
he rang and there was only a short delay before alice mair opened the door .
he saw a tall , handsome woman dressed with careful and expensive informality in a black cashmere sweater with a silk scarf at the throat and fawn trousers .
he would have recognized her from her strong resemblance to her brother , although she looked the elder by some years .
she took it for granted that each knew who the other was , and standing aside to motion him in she said : â€˜ it 's good of you to be so accommodating , mr dalgliesh .
i 'm afraid nora gurney is implacable .
once she knew you were on your way to norfolk you were a predestined victim .
perhaps you would bring the proofs through to the kitchen . â€™
it was a distinguished face with the deep-set , widely spaced eyes beneath straight brows , a well-shaped , rather secretive mouth and strong greying hair swept upwards and curled into a chignon .
in her publicity photographs she could , he recalled , look beautiful in a somewhat intimidating , intellectual and very english mould .
but seen face to face , even in the informality of her own house , the absence of a spark of sexuality and , he sensed , a deep-seated reserve , made her seem less feminine and more formidable than he had expected , and she held herself stiffly as if repelling invaders of her personal space .
the handshake with which she had greeted him had been cool and firm and her brief smile was surprisingly attractive .
he knew that he was oversensitive to the timbre of the human voice and hers , although not jarring or unpleasant , sounded a little forced as if she were deliberately speaking at an unnatural pitch .
he followed her down the hall to the kitchen at the back of the house .
it was , he judged , almost twenty feet long and obviously served the triple purpose of sitting room , working place and office .
the right-hand half of the room was a well-equipped kitchen with a large gas stove and an aga , a butcher 's chopping block , a dresser to the right of the door holding an assortment of gleaming pots , and a long working surface with a wooden triangle sheathing her assortment of knives .
in the centre of the room was a large wooden table holding a stoneware jar of dried flowers .
on the left-hand wall was a working fireplace , the two recesses fitted with wall-to-ceiling bookshelves .
to each side of the hearth was a high-backed wicker armchair in an intricate closely woven design fitted with patchwork cushions .
there was an open roll-top desk facing one of the wide windows and , to its right , a stable door , the top half open , gave a view of the paved courtyard .
dalgliesh could glimpse what was obviously her herb garden planted in elegant terracotta pots carefully disposed to catch the sun .
the room , which contained nothing superfluous , nothing pretentious , was both pleasing and extraordinarily comforting and , for a moment , he wondered why .
was it the faint smell of herbs and newly baked dough , the soft ticking of the wall-mounted clock which seemed both to mark the passing seconds and yet to hold time in thrall , the rhythmic moaning of the sea through the half-open door , the sense of well-fed ease conveyed by the two cushioned armchairs , the open hearth ?
or was it that the kitchen reminded dalgliesh of that rectory kitchen where the lonely only child had found warmth and undemanding , uncensorious companionship , been given hot dripping toast and small forbidden treats ?
he placed the proofs on the desk , refused alice mair 's offer of coffee and followed her back to the front door .
she walked out with him to the car and said : â€˜ i was sorry about your aunt â€” sorry for you , i mean .
i expect that for an ornithologist death ceases to be terrible once sight and hearing begin to go .
and to die in one 's sleep without distress to oneself or inconvenience to others is an enviable end .
but you had known her for so long that she must have seemed immortal . â€™
formal condolences , he thought , were never easy to speak or accept and usually sounded either banal or insincere .
hers had been perceptive .
jane dalgliesh had indeed seemed to him immortal .
the very old , he thought , make our past .
once they go it seems for a moment that neither it nor we have any real existence .
he said : â€˜ i do n't think death was ever terrible to her .
i 'm not sure that i really knew her and i 'm left wishing i 'd tried harder .
but i shall miss her . â€™
alice mair said : â€˜ i did n't know her either .
perhaps i should have tried harder too .
she was a very private woman , i suspect one of those fortunate people who find no other company more agreeable than their own .
it always seems presumptuous to encroach on that self-sufficiency .
perhaps you share it .
but if you can tolerate company , i 'm having a few people , mostly colleagues of alex from the power station , to dinner on thursday night .
would you care to join us ?
seven thirty for eight . â€™
it sounded , he thought , more like a challenge than an invitation .
somewhat to his surprise , dalgliesh found himself accepting .
but then the whole encounter had been a little surprising .
she stood regarding him with a serious intensity as he let in the clutch and turned the car and he had the impression that she was watching critically to see how he handled it .
but at least , he thought as he gave a final wave , she had n't asked him whether he had come to norfolk to help catch the whistler .
three minutes later he raised his foot from the accelerator .
ahead of him , trudging along on the left of the path , was a little group of children , the eldest girl wheeling a pushchair with two smaller children , one each side of her , clutching the bars .
hearing the noise of the car she turned and he saw a peaked , delicate face framed with red-gold hair .
he recognized the blaney children , met once before with their mother walking along the beach .
obviously the eldest girl had been shopping : the folding pushchair had a shelf under the seat lumped high with plastic bags .
instinctively he slowed down .
they were unlikely to be in real danger , the whistler stalked at night , not in broad daylight , and no vehicle had passed him since he left the coastal road .
but the child looked grossly overburdened and ought not to be so far from home .
though he had never seen their cottage he seemed to remember that his aunt had told him that it lay about two miles to the south .
he recalled what he knew about them , that their father earned a precarious living as a painter whose innocuous , prettified watercolours were sold in cafã©s and tourist shops along the coast and that their mother had been desperately ill with cancer .
he wondered whether mrs blaney was still alive .
his instinct was to pile the children into the car and drive them home but that , he knew , was hardly sensible .
almost certainly the eldest child â€” theresa , was n't it ? â€” had been taught not to accept lifts from strangers , particularly men , and he was virtually a stranger .
on an impulse he reversed the jaguar and drove quickly back to martyr 's cottage .
this time the front door was open and a swathe of sunlight lay across the red-tiled floor .
alice mair had heard the car and came out to him from the kitchen , wiping her hands .
he said : â€˜ the blaney children are walking home .
theresa is wheeling a pushchair and trying to cope with the twins .
i thought i could offer a lift if i had a woman with me , someone they know . â€™
she said briefly : â€˜ they know me . â€™
without another word she went back into the kitchen then came out to him , closed the front door after her without locking it and got into the car .
putting it into gear , his arm brushed her knee .
he was aware of an almost imperceptible withdrawing , more emotional than physical , a small delicate gesture of self-containment .
dalgliesh doubted whether that half-imagined recoil had anything to do with him personally , nor did he find her silence disconcerting .
their conversation , when they did speak , was brief .
he asked : â€˜ is mrs blaney still alive ? â€™
â€˜ no .
she died six weeks ago . â€™
â€˜ how are they managing ? â€™
â€˜ not particularly well , i imagine .
but ryan blaney does n't welcome interference .
i sympathize .
once he lets down his defences half the social workers in norfolk , amateur and professional , will move in on him . â€™
when they drew up beside the little band it was alice mair who opened the car door and spoke .
â€˜ theresa , here is mr dalgliesh to give you all a lift .
he 's miss dalgliesh 's nephew from larksoken mill .
one of the twins had better sit on my lap .
the rest of you and the pushchair can fit into the back . â€™
theresa looked at dalgliesh without smiling and said a grave thank you .
she reminded him of pictures of the young elizabeth tudor , the same red-gold hair framing a curiously adult face both secretive and self-composed , the same sharp nose and wary eyes .
the faces of the twins , softer editions of her own , turned towards her questioningly then broke into shy smiles .
they looked as if they had been dressed in a hurry and not very suitably for a long walk on the headland , even in a warm autumn .
one wore a tattered summer dress in pink spotted cotton with double flounces , the other a pinafore over a checked blouse .
their pathetically thin legs were unprotected .
theresa was wearing jeans and a grubby sweat shirt with a map of london 's underground across the front .
dalgliesh found himself wondering if it had been brought back from a school trip to the capital .
it was too large for her and the wide sleeves of limp cotton hung from her freckled arms like rags thrown over a stick .
in contrast to his sisters , anthony was over-clad , a bundle of leggings , jumper and a padded jacket topped with a woollen helmet with a bobble pulled well down over his forehead , beneath which he surveyed their busyness , unsmiling , like a stout imperious caesar .
dalgliesh got out of the jaguar and tried to extricate him from the pushchair , but the anatomy of the chair momentarily defeated him .
there was a bar beneath which the child 's rigid legs were obstinately stuck .
the solid uncooperative bundle was surprisingly heavy ; it was like trying to manoeuvre a firm and rather smelly poultice .
theresa gave him a brief , pitying smile , dragged the plastic bags from beneath the seat then expertly freed her brother and settled him on her left hip while , with the other hand , she collapsed the pushchair , with a single vigorous shake .
dalgliesh took the baby from her while theresa helped the children into the jaguar and commanded with sudden fierceness , â€˜ sit still . â€™
anthony , recognizing incompetence , grasped dalgliesh 's hair firmly with a sticky hand and he felt the momentary touch of a cheek , so soft that it was like the fall of a petal .
throughout these manoeuvrings alice mair sat quietly watching from the car but made no move to help .
it was impossible to know what she was thinking .
but once the jaguar had moved away she turned to theresa and said in a voice of surprising gentleness : â€˜ does your father know that you 're out alone ? â€™
â€˜ daddy has taken the van to mr sparks .
it 's due for its mot test .
mr sparks does n't think it 's going to pass .
and i found we 'd run out of milk for anthony .
we have to have milk .
and we wanted some more disposable nappies . â€™
alice mair said : â€˜ i 'm giving a dinner party on thursday evening .
if your father agrees , would you like to come and help with the table like you did last month ? â€™
â€˜ what are you going to cook , miss mair ? â€˜
â€˜ put your head close so that i can whisper .
mr dalgliesh is going to be one of the guests .
i want it to be a surprise . â€˜
the pale golden head leaned forward towards the grey and miss mair whispered .
theresa smiled and then nodded with serious satisfaction in a moment of grave feminine conspiracy .
but next morning ruth awakened early and , leaving miss beard to her gentle dreams , dressed quickly and hurried out of the house .
it was another golden day .
she still retained her english habit of noting each day 's weather , always expecting changes , marvelling at the hot sunny days which followed one after the other , almost with monotony .
when she reached the plateau she remained standing , watching for joss barnet , waiting for the moment when she would see him riding towards her .
there was no longer any need for her to be
â€˜ discovered â€™ .
her sole purpose in being there was to meet him and she was content that he should know it .
he was late this morning .
or was she earlier than she thought ?
had she misjudged the time ?
no matter .
she was happy to wait for him , certain that soon she would see him riding towards her .
then as the minutes passed and there was no sign of him , she considered that perhaps he had overslept .
it could happen .
or had his horse gone lame , cast a shoe ?
she sat down and prepared to wait as long as was necessary .
she knew that in the end he would come .
after a few more minutes she became restless , and stood up again , her eyes searching the slope of the hillside and the valley below , trying to determine whether some small movement down there was a man on horseback or merely a trick of her imagination .
should she set off down the hill to meet him ?
but perhaps he would come by another route and then she would miss him .
at the end of what she reckoned must be an hour , she faced the fact that he was not coming .
she dropped to the ground again and lay down , burying her face in the sweet-smelling grass .
she had been mistaken ever to think that he would come .
she had let her overwhelming desire feed her imagination ; had read something into his words , his looks , his actions , which had not been there at all .
her face burned with the shame of it .
such was the feeling joss barnet had aroused in her , that not for one moment did it occur to her to blame him for anything .
it was all her fault .
sick at heart , she wept .
then she dried her eyes on the hem of her petticoat and went slowly back to the house .
â€˜ so you 've decided to put in an appearance ? â€™
cook said .
â€˜ i do seem to recall something about you offering to help me with the party preparations .
but of course if you 've changed your mind â€¦ â€™
â€˜ i have n't , â€™ ruth snapped .
â€˜ i 'm ready to start now .
i do n't want any breakfast . â€™
â€˜ hoity-toity !
what 's the matter with everyone this morning ? â€™
cook demanded .
â€˜ there 's sean o'farrell and the master left in a hurry this hour past for new york city , both without a bite inside them â€” and now you . â€™
â€˜ gone to new york ? â€™
â€˜ that 's what i said . â€™
with mrs cranbrook 's words ruth 's appetite immediately returned .
so he had not failed her after all !
how could she have thought that he would ?
something unforeseen and urgent had happened , since sean had obviously known of it yesterday afternoon , and there had been no opportunity for him to inform her .
relief surged through her like a physical infusion of new blood .
â€˜ i 've changed my mind , â€™ she said .
â€˜ i would like some breakfast .
suddenly i 'm hungry .
when will they be back ? â€™
â€˜ sean ?
how should i know ?
i do n't understand business .
what i do understand is that if the master 's not home for the party tomorrow , the mistress wo n't be pleased â€” and that 's putting it mildly .
do n't you dawdle over your breakfast then , not if you intend to make yourself useful .
there 's plenty to be done . â€™
ruth worked all that day as though she had the strength of ten .
they prepared chicken pies , the pastry as light as ruth 's heart , turtle soup , a haunch of venison , jellies , blancmanges , syllabubs , trifles , and a host of other dishes , with still more to be done on the day of the party itself .
mrs cranbrook unbent so far as to show approval .
â€˜ you 've done very well , â€™ she conceded .
mrs carson , knowing how much was involved , had excused ruth from all other duties until anna 's bedtime hour .
and now it approached .
she took off the voluminous apron cook had lent her and went in search of her charge .
anna was in tears .
â€˜ we 're going home , â€™ she sobbed .
â€˜ i do n't want to go back to mrs gutermann 's .
i want to stay with edward .
i want to live with him for ever and ever ! â€™
ruth could think of few worse fates , but her stomach lurched at the thought of leaving millfield .
â€˜ how do you know we 're leaving ? â€™ she asked .
â€˜ who told you ? â€™
â€˜ miss fitch , â€™ anna wailed .
â€˜ i do n't like miss fitch .
i hate her !
i daresay she wants me to go ! â€™
â€˜ perhaps she 's mistaken , â€™ ruth said , though she doubted if miss fitch was ever wrong .
â€˜ we 'll ask your mama the moment she comes in . â€™
â€˜ i 'm afraid it 's true , â€™ mrs carson told them .
â€˜ of course we were only invited for ten days or so . â€™
ruth had lost count of time .
to her , the long summer days had stretched ahead , world without end .
â€˜ we are going to leave on sunday , â€™ mrs carson went on .
â€˜ not too early in the day , since i daresay we shall all be tired after tomorrow 's party . â€™
â€˜ anna tells me she never wants to leave edward , â€™ ruth said after the child had gone to sleep .
mrs carson smiled indulgently .
â€˜ dearest anna !
she 's a little young for a holiday infatuation , but we all have them sooner or later .
thank goodness they never last !
and the more intense they are , the shorter the duration , so anna should soon be over it . â€™
â€˜ will mr barnet be back for the party ? â€™
ruth asked .
â€˜ i expect you mean will o'farrell be back , â€™ mrs carson said .
â€˜ and the answer is , i do n't know .
mrs barnet tells me that she expects her husband when she sees him .
it 's a fact that american men seem to put business before everything .
thank goodness englishmen are not like that ! â€™
next morning ruth was down in the kitchen early , eagerly hoping to find sean there .
he could well have returned late at night and she not heard him , though she had stayed awake for a long time , listening for the sound of the horses , the carriage wheels on the drive .
there was no sign of sean but mrs cranbrook was already at work .
â€˜ i hope you 're ready to help me , â€™ she said .
â€˜ everybody is busy with this and that â€” as if food was n't the most important thing ! â€™
â€˜ i 'll help , mrs cranbrook , â€™ ruth agreed .
â€˜ they 're not back then ? â€™
she tried to sound nonchalant .
â€˜ not back ?
oh , you mean o'farrell and the master ?
not that i know of .
there 's no telling when they â€˜ u return .
sometimes they 're gone for three or four days at a time . â€™
â€˜ but surely â€¦ with the party ? â€™
mrs cranbrook shrugged .
â€˜ he 's a law unto himself , the master .
not for the likes of you and me to question why . â€™
the heart had gone out of the day .
ruth fetched and carried and stirred and whipped , praying every moment that joss barnet would return before they left millfield next day .
but when the day had dragged to evening â€” in spite of all there was to do the time now passed slowly â€” and still there was no sign of the two men , she began to lose hope .
in the evening , bone-tired , she left the kitchen and went to put a reluctant anna to bed .
then she turned to helping mrs carson .
she brushed her mistress 's hair and piled it on top of her head in a cluster of curls , carefully and meticulously arranged to look quite casual .
it was a style ruth had devised herself and mrs carson was delighted with the result .
â€˜ it looks so different , â€™ she said .
â€˜ you really are quite clever at this , ruth .
and now for my dress . â€™
she looked beautiful in the yellow satin , the low-cut bodice tight against her slight figure , the skirt billowing out .
but ruth had no heart either to appreciate or to envy her mistress .
her spirits were at their lowest ebb .
mrs carson gave her maid a sharp , compassionate look .
she thought she knew the cause of this mood and in a way she was glad to see it .
at least it showed that the girl 's mind was working in the right direction .
â€˜ do n't worry , ruth , â€™ she said kindly .
â€˜ i dare say o'farrell will be back tomorrow before we leave .
and if not , there is always new york when the barnets return in the fall .
and now i sha n't need you again this evening , so apart from looking in on anna from time to time , you may do just as you please . â€™
had she not been so downhearted ruth would have enjoyed herself .
but she had given up all hope of joss barnet returning that evening and nothing else in the world mattered .
the party scene was pretty enough .
coloured lanterns hung in the trees which fringed the lawn and bordered the lake beyond .
torchlights , flaring against the night sky and reflected in the water , had been set up wherever it was suitable .
already the orchestra had begun to play and the elegantly dressed to appear .
ruth had no heart for it .
she climbed the stairs to her room , then undressed and went to bed , wetting the pillow with her tears which , held back all day , now flowed unchecked .
her only comfort was not to have miss beard in her room , to be able to suffer in solitude .
though she thought sleep would never come , eventually it did .
she fell asleep to the sound of music drifting upwards from the drawing-room .
when she wakened it was still dark , the orchestra still playing , though it was not that which had aroused her .
penetrating her sleep she had heard the faint click of the door latch , and then the familiar squeak of the hinge as the door to her room slowly opened .
she raised herself on one elbow , blinking her eyes , trying to see in the darkness .
but enough light came from the landing on to which the door opened to silhouette the man standing there .
it was joss barnet .
shock made her cry out , and he closed the door and moved towards her in quick strides , putting his hand across her mouth to stop-her scream .
then he sat on her bed and , without a word from either of them , she went willingly into his arms and was held close in his embrace .
she felt his heart beating strong and fast against hers .
they stayed like that for a long moment and then he said , â€˜ light the candle . â€™
â€˜ i ca n't , â€™ she whispered .
â€˜ someone will see the light under the door . â€™
â€˜ no matter if they do , â€™ he said .
â€˜ they will not think of me here .
only my coachman knows i am home .
i have not yet joined the party . â€™
â€˜ you came to me first ? â€™
she could hardly believe it .
he would not tell her , this funny bewitching little english girl , that he had come to her first because he could not keep away from her .
she had been on his mind since the morning he had seen her from his horse ; frightened yet defiant , sparking with anger .
almost , but not quite , she had come between him and the work he had had to do in new york city .
the moment the work was done he had ordered his coachman to drive him back to millfield as fast as the horses would go .
â€˜ light the candle , â€™ he repeated .
ruth 's fingers trembled as she obeyed him .
then she lay back on her pillow and they looked at each other as if it was for the first time .
he traced the contours of her face with gentle fingers , outlining the curve of her mouth , stroking her temples .
without any hurry , in spite of the impatience which had brought him here , he caressed the length of her neck and the slope of her shoulders .
from out of nowhere , ruth remembered dick parker : but not , this time , the pleasure of her union with him , only the pain it had brought her on the christmas eve following .
and now although her whole body cried out for fulfilment and she longed for joss barnet to complete what he had surely come to do , she knew that she must not let it happen .
she turned her face away from him , pushed his hand from her .
â€˜ no ! â€™ she cried .
â€˜ you must not ! â€™
he gave not the slightest sign of having heard her , continuing to stroke her neck , and now inserting his fingers under the neckline of her nightshift .
she tried again to push him away .
â€˜ please !
please do n't ! â€™ she cried .
it was surprise which made him stop for a second .
he smiled at her , an unexpectedly tender smile .
â€˜ i wo n't hurt you , â€™ he said .
â€˜ do n't be afraid . â€™
â€˜ i 'm not afraid of being hurt . â€™
â€˜ then what â€¦ ? â€™
â€˜ i 'm afraid of afterwards , â€™ she said hesitantly .
â€˜ if i were to have a child .
it would be the end of the world for me . â€™
â€˜ but you wo n't , â€™ he assured her .
â€˜ i 'll see to that .
i 'm not totally callous . â€™
â€˜ you promise ? â€™
â€˜ i promise . â€™
she lay quiescent and felt his strong fingers , quicker now , move to unfasten the buttons of her shift one by one .
and when he had undone her gown , and had difficulty in lifting it over her head , she raised herself from the pillow and helped him to take it off .
then he pulled down the sheet , which was all the bedclothes she had needed on that warm night , and she lay naked before him .
she observed him without shame as he looked at every part of her .
her pleasure was in him , and in his delight of her .
when , at last , he stripped off his clothes and came into her , it was as if this was the moment to which all her life had been leading .
he was a skilful lover : tender and gentle in the beginning , then powerful , persistent , rough almost â€” until , his passion rising in harmony with hers , the climax came like the bursting of a thousand stars , like the beginning and ending of the world .
afterwards they lay quietly side by side , not speaking , until he said , â€˜ i must go . â€™
â€˜ not yet , â€™ she begged .
â€˜ you ca n't leave me yet . â€™
she turned over and lay on top of him , trying to pin him down with her own slight weight , and he began to fondle her and she him , and almost at once they were making love again .
â€˜ you are a sorceress , â€™ he told her when it was all over .
â€˜ an enchantress .
women as tempting as you should be kept out of the sight of mortal men . â€™
â€˜ you 're not a mortal man , â€™ ruth said .
â€˜ you 're a god ! â€™
he laughed out loud .
â€˜ hush ! â€™ she cautioned .
â€˜ someone will hear you . â€™
â€˜ i 'm a real man all right , â€™ he said .
â€˜ as i 've just proved to you .
and would again if time allowed . â€™
then he stood up and quickly began to dress .
â€˜ i must go and do my duty as a host for what 's left of the night . â€™
â€˜ do n't leave me , â€™ she begged .
â€˜ please stay ! â€™
he looked at her in surprise , spoke brusquely .
â€˜ but of course i must go .
there 's no question . â€™
long afterwards ruth realised that this was the moment when she had learned that she could never come first with him .
however much he might desire her , she would have no more than the allotted space in his life .
â€˜ when am i going to see you again ? â€™ she asked .
that , also , was the wrong thing to say .
â€˜ i ca n't make plans , â€™ he said sharply .
â€˜ but we leave tomorrow ! â€™ she exclaimed .
that took him by surprise .
â€˜ the deuce you do !
well i shall see to that .
my wife will extend the invitation to the carsons .
i take it they 're not promised elsewhere ? â€™
â€˜ oh no , â€™ ruth said .
â€˜ we 're going back to new york city . â€™
he finished dressing , then came and held her by the shoulders , kissing her lightly on the mouth .
as he was leaving he turned around and threw a small box on to the bed .
â€˜ from the city , â€™ he said .
â€˜ you see that i had you in my mind ! â€™
he was out of the room before she could open the box , a dark blue leather affair , lined with white velvet , against which lay a fine gold chain with a small oval locket set around the edge with seed pearls .
she gasped in amazement .
it was without doubt the most beautiful thing she had ever owned , or ever would .
such delicacy , such refinement !
her fingers trembling with excitement , she fastened it around her neck .
it should remain there for ever .
she would never take it off .
ellen and i lingered on in mama sipcott 's for another hour and a half ; indulging in the sailor 's shorebound pastime of planning the perfect voyage .
we decided that masquerade would sail from the bahamas to panama , and thence to the galapagos where we would find darwin 's giant tortoises .
then we would sail south to easter island to explore the mysterious statues before going to the mutineers ' refuge on pitcairn island .
after that we would go to tahiti , and i saw the excitement grow in ellen as she realised that these plans were so close to coming true .
it was an excitement that matched my own , for i had never sailed the south seas and i had long dreamed of that scatter of tiny , magically named islands strewn across one third of a globe .
by the time we had drunk our third bottle of wine ellen and i had long reached new zealand and were already sailing north towards new caledonia .
we were happy .
we caught the bus back to ellen 's apartment and collected her clothes and notebooks .
she was moving back on board wavebreaker in preparation for the next day 's early departure .
i carried her luggage to the yard , noting that even ellen 's strident feminism evaporated in the face of two heavy bags and tropical heat .
once in the boatyard ellen ran ahead of me , evidently eager to reach wavebreaker 's air conditioning .
then , as she reached the dock 's edge , she suddenly checked .
â€˜ what on earth is that ?
oh , no ! â€™
she began to run again .
when i reached the water 's edge i understood her dismay .
a large sports-fishing boat was moored alongside wavebreaker , but moored so crudely that whoever had brought the powerboat alongside the schooner had not bothered to put out fenders , but instead had gouged long ugly gashes in wavebreaker 's white paint .
yet even the gashes were not so ugly as the expensive boat that had caused them .
there was nothing wrong with the boat 's lines , which were sleekly functional , but her long powerful hull , her upperworks , and even the interior of her capacious working deck had all been painted with a wartime dazzle paint .
the seemingly random and jagged-edged pattern of blue , black , silver , green and white had been designed to disguise a boat 's shape from the prying eyes of u-boat captains , so it seemed somewhat fanciful to thus camouflage a pleasure boat in the bahamas .
this boat was called dream baby , and she was clearly an expensive infant for rods and whip-aerials and outriggers splayed from her upperworks like the antennae of some outlandish insect .
she boasted a harpoon walkway , a flybridge , and , above the highest wheel-platform , an aluminium canopy which held a radar aerial .
the fighting chair on her aft deck had thick white leather straps giving it the appearance of a padded electric chair , while the dazzle paint gave the boat an oddly military look that was completed by the number 666 that was painted on her bows in silver-edged black numerals like those warships use to display their commissioning numbers .
the boat 's wrap-around windscreens were made of black polarised glass which only added to dream baby 's ugly air of menace .
ellen , unencumbered with luggage , had already reached wavebreaker and taken two plastic fenders from a locker .
she swung lithely down to dream baby 's gaudily painted deck and cushioned the two hulls .
â€˜ how bad is the damage ? â€™
i called down to her when i reached wavebreaker .
â€˜ it 's scraped back to bare metal ! â€™
â€˜ i 'll give it some paint . â€™
wavebreaker 's hull was made of steel and , while such hulls are marvellously strong and safe , they are soon weakened if their steel is exposed to salt air .
i had to paint the gashes as soon as possible so that rust would not begin to bite into wavebreaker 's long sleekness .
ellen looked around the oddly painted powerboat .
â€˜ you 'd think someone rich enough to own a rig like this could afford a pair of fenders . â€™
â€˜ who cares ?
just cut the damn boat loose , â€™ i said vengefully .
ellen ignored my advice while i , obedient to the rule that if a job needed doing then do it without delay , found a pot of white paint and dug through the locker for a clean brush .
then , from behind me , an unfamiliar voice sounded : â€˜ oh , ring my bells . â€™
it was a man 's voice ; drawling and lazy .
i twisted around and almost blinded myself by staring straight into the sun , but then , through the dizzying glare , i made out the long silhouette of a tall man who seemed , incongruously , to be dressed in a long , transparent dressing gown .
he was emerging in stately fashion from wavebreaker 's companionway and , though i could see he was tall and lanky and had a ponytail of hair , i could make out no details of his face .
â€˜ who the hell are you ? â€™
i demanded .
the man ignored me , walking instead towards ellen who , dressed only in shorts and t-shirt , was climbing long-legged over wavebreaker 's rail .
â€˜ be still my restless heart , â€™ the man had a strong , caressing voice and the slow luscious accent of america 's deep south .
â€˜ dear lady , dear lady , to think that i might have lived my whole life through and never seen you .
oh , lay me down , just lay me down . â€™
ellen , usually so quick with a scornful reply , just stood and stared at the elegant stranger who stopped one pace away from her , took her hand , then bowed above her fingers .
he kissed the air a fastidiously polite inch above her knuckles , then closed his eyes .
â€˜ dear sweet lord above , i do thank thee for thy kindness in showing me this lovely woman before i died . â€™
to my astonishment and chagrin ellen left her hand in his as he opened his eyes and smiled at her .
â€˜ my name , â€™ he stroked her with his voice , â€˜ is jesse isambard sweetman .
and who , dear creature , are you ? â€™
ellen still said nothing .
i had straightened up and moved aside so that the sun no longer dazzled me and i could see sweetman properly , and what i saw i did not like .
his face was old and young , sardonic and knowing , amused and handsome ; the face of a man who has seen the world 's wickedness and knows how to match it with his own .
his long black hair was tied into its ponytail with a velvet ribbon , his skin was parchment pale , and his eyes dark .
i put his age at forty , but even among men twenty years younger he would have been accounted handsome , and he knew it , for his expression showed both confidence and amusement as he continued to hold ellen 's hand , and he showed even more amusement when she suddenly realised just what liberty she was thus granting him and jerked her fingers swiftly away .
thus released , jesse sweetman turned to look at me .
the dressing gown had proved to be a long , stylish , ankle-length duster coat which was loosely woven from a delicate white cotton .
beneath the filmy topcoat he wore a black shirt and black trousers that were tucked into tall black boots .
it was a dramatic and impractical outfit of a kind i only expected to see on the male models who posed in the more outlandish fashion magazines that our rich clients brought aboard wavebreaker , yet jesse isambard sweetman managed to wear the elaborate style with an elegant insouciance .
the only incongruous note was a cheap round badge , enamelled in red and yellow , that he wore on his shirt , which bore the legend â€˜ just say no ! â€™ .
â€˜ you must be nicholas breakspear , â€™ he said carelessly , as though he did not much care whether i was or not .
â€˜ is that gaudy piece of junk your boat ? â€™
i gestured to where dream baby 's aerials showed above wavebreaker 's gunwale .
sweetman turned and pretended to notice the sports-fishing boat for the first time .
â€˜ no , â€™ he said helpfully , then bestowed a patronising smile on me .
â€˜ you look so like your father .
it 's really uncanny . â€™
â€˜ did you bring that boat here ? â€™
i persevered .
â€˜ oh , indeed i did , â€™ he said brightly , as though he merely indulged a rather dim child 's curiosity .
â€˜ your mother was malise fielding , am i right ?
or are you lucy de sills â€™ son ? â€™
â€˜ why the hell did n't you use fenders when you tied alongside ? â€™
he sighed , intimating what a bore i was being .
â€˜ i did not use fenders , breakspear , because i despise precautions .
precautions are the symptoms of small and fearful minds .
precautions will not conquer empires , they will not build great cities , they will not transmute dreams into gold or carry men across wide oceans , and precautions will not , emphatically not , win fair ladies , â€™ and here he turned to ellen and lasciviously dropped his gaze to her long bare legs .
ellen twisted away and sweetman laughed at her obvious discomfiture , then , as coolly as though he owned wavebreaker , he stepped down into the central cockpit where he first brushed at , then sat on , one of the white cushioned seats by the ship 's wheel .
â€˜ i 've had a look round the boat , â€™ he said very coolly , â€˜ and i approve of her .
so tell me the cost of a week 's charter . â€™
â€˜ the man you want to see , â€™ i said , â€˜ is called matthew mcillvanney and his office is the pink building with the outside staircase .
he 's not here this afternoon , but you can doubtless telephone him next week . â€™
sweetman took a pair of polarised sunglasses from his shirt pocket and put them on before inspecting me again .
he did not seem to like what he saw .
â€˜ you 're really not being noticeably helpful , â€™ he said after a pause , â€˜ so let us try again shall we ?
would you please tell me the high season price for one week ? â€™
â€˜ how many passengers ? â€™
ellen asked before i could refuse to answer .
sweetman paused again , this time to light a long pale blue cigarette with a slim gold lighter .
he shrugged .
â€˜ two , four , six passengers ?
does it really matter ? â€™
â€˜ one week in high season costs ten thousand us dollars for two people , and every extra couple is another thousand bucks . â€™
ellen 's voice was cold , as though she disliked satisfying his curiosity .
â€˜ and to those prices you have to add the boat 's running costs . â€™
â€˜ which are ? â€™
sweetman asked carelessly .
â€˜ a lot . â€™
ellen said flatly .
â€˜ you 're talking fuel , food and liquor , plus any toys you might want aboard like scuba equipment , snorkels , jet-skis or sailboards . â€™
sweetman drew on his fancy cigarette , then blew a plume of smoke into wavebreaker 's rigging before smiling lazily at ellen .
â€˜ and tell me , sweet creature , do you count as a toy ?
or are you a part of the initial ten thousand dollars ? â€™
â€˜ get off the boat , â€™ i said .
â€˜ shut up . â€™
he turned on me like a snake .
â€˜ you 're nothing but a hired hand , breakspear , so shut the fuck up . â€™
he glanced at the paint pot and brush that i was still holding .
â€˜ go and paint something .
be useful . â€™
he stared into my eyes , challenging me to defy him , and when i did not move he looked back to ellen .
â€˜ i asked you a question , dear heart .
please be so good as to answer . â€™
â€˜ get off this boat , â€™ i told him , but my anger only amused sweetman who unfolded his long thin legs from the cushioned thwart .
â€˜ dick off , â€™ he said to me .
i was surprised that he so eagerly sought to confront me .
i am not a small man , nor am i a weakling , yet the thin sweetman seemed unconcerned as i jumped down into the cockpit .
then i saw why he was so confident .
he put a hand into a pocket of his elegant duster coat and brought out a small .22 pistol that he pointed at my face .
â€˜ a ladies â€™ gun , â€™ he said , â€˜ but remarkably effective at close range . â€™
â€˜ nick ! â€™
ellen called warningly , as though i might not have seen the gun .
the gun 's threat had not stopped my advance .
i was calling sweetman 's bluff , confident he would not dare pull the trigger , and equally confident that my marine training would let me turn him into mincemeat .
i was also half drunk , and thus filled with the dutch courage offered by mama sipcott 's worst white wine .
sweetman stood .
there was , at last , a look of alarm on his face , and i could see him wondering whether he really would have to pull the small trigger .
he held the gun pointed at my eyes .
the picture , very like the one rufus fletcher had taken in the summer of 1976 , occupied the screen for about fifteen seconds .
the whole item was allowed no more than four times that in the bbc 's sunday evening news broadcast at 6.30 .
the other forty-five seconds were taken up by a policeman talking to a reporter about having nothing to say except that there would be an inquest .
but shiva and lili manjusri saw the picture and so did rufus fletcher .
adam verne-smith , unwinding in puerto de la cruz , did not of course see it .
he did not even see an english newspaper .
they were expensive to buy and came a day late .
he did not want to be reminded of home and the only paper he even glanced at was the international herald tribune , a copy of which anne found on the beach .
his father , at home in edgware , said to his wife :
â€˜ good god , wyvis hall , as i live and breathe . â€™
beryl verne-smith peered , but the picture immediately vanished .
â€˜ yes , i suppose it was . â€™
the policeman talked , the reporter trying to jog him into revelations and failing .
in the background , autumnal trees could be seen and a church on the summit of a low hill .
lewis verne-smith sat shaking his head , less as a gesture of denial than of a generalized despair at the state of the world .
it was not that unpleasant memories were evoked , for these were always with him , his existence was inseparable from that old bitterness , but that a sight of the house , even the glimpse of a photograph , revived the precise feelings he had had â€” why , it must be getting on for eleven years ago .
â€˜ ten and a half , â€™ said his wife .
â€˜ i shall have to get in touch with the police .
no two ways about it , i shall have to get in touch with them . â€™
â€˜ not this evening , surely ? â€™ said beryl , who wanted to watch mastermind .
lewis said nothing .
the room in which they were sitting underwent the curious shrinking process to which it was subject whenever he was reminded of wyvis hall or his uncle hilbert or even if the county of suffolk were mentioned .
suddenly it grew small and poky .
the brick side-wall of his neighbour 's house seemed to have moved itself four or five feet further towards the dividing fence , so that it loomed offensively .
lewis got up and pulled the curtains across with a pettish jerk of his hands .
â€˜ should n't you wait until adam gets back ? â€™
beryl said .
â€˜ why ?
what would that be in aid of ? â€™
beryl meant that adam had been among the previous owners of wyvis hall while her husband had not , but she knew better than to point this out .
â€˜ there is no one living knows that lovely place better than 1 . â€™
â€˜ that 's true . â€™
â€˜ i sha n't wait till adam returns , â€™ lewis said in that manner that had once led his daughter to call him the frog footman ,
â€˜ but i shall wait until tomorrow . â€™
men and women do not usually put their baser feelings and intentions into words , not even in the deep recesses of their own minds .
so lewis did not say , even to himself , when he was privately considering trying to get hold of his son in tenerife , that he disliked adam and would have been pleased to spoil his holiday .
instead , he rationalized his thoughts and justified himself adam probably â€” indeed , almost certainly â€” knew nothing about the find in the pine wood , but adam had once owned the house and had thus taken on a responsibility .
he could not shed that responsibility just because he had sold the place .
lewis would have agreed with oscar wilde that our past is what we are .
we can not rid ourselves of it .
therefore it was adam 's duty to come home and face the music , even though this might be no more than a short blast on a tin whistle .
but he had no precise idea where adam was and he did not think adam 's travel agent ( a personal friend of the young verne-smiths ) would tell him .
some excuse would be made for not telling him .
lewis 's bark , anyway , was always worse than his bite .
he had virtually no bite , as he had once overheard adam say to bridget , and heard it with helpless chagrin .
â€˜ a bloody good thing or our childhood would have been a misery instead of just a bore . â€™
lewis walked into his local police station in edgware on monday morning .
they seemed surprised to see him but not astonished .
the suffolk police had begun hunting up previous owners of wyvis hall and they had been alerted that a verne-smith lived in their area .
there were , after all , only two in the london phone directory .
this might be a bonus .
he was asked to wait and then shown into a room where a detective sergeant prepared to take a statement from him .
with busy pomposity lewis dictated it to a typist and would have gone on and on had he not been diplomatically restrained .
â€˜ wyvis hall , nunes , suffolk , and the twenty acres of land surrounding it were the property , through his marriage , of my uncle , hilbert verne-smith .
they came into the possession of my son hilbert john adam verne-smith under my uncle 's will , bypassing myself , though my son was no more than nineteen at the time of my uncle 's death .
being an undergraduate at the time , my son naturally never considered actually residing in the house .
he was in agreement with my suggestion that the property be sold and before he returned to college in the autumn of 1976 , he took my advice and placed house and lands in the hands of an estate agent .
â€˜ country properties were not selling well at the time .
â£45,000 was the asking price and i was not surprised that the sale , so to speak , hung fire .
however , in the spring of 1977 an offer was made , which my son accepted .
this sale later fell through and it was not until the following august that wyvis hall was finally sold to a mr and mrs langan for the much improved figure of â£51,995 .
â€˜ as far as i know , my son 's personal acquaintance with wyvis hall was confined to my uncle 's lifetime when 1 , my wife and son and daughter frequently stayed with him .
after my uncle 's death in april 1976 he visited wyvis hall on perhaps two , or at the most three , separate occasions simply for the purpose of looking it over and reaching a decision about the disposal of furniture and effects .
â€˜ i suppose it is possible that squatters or other vagrants took possession of the house between the time of my uncle 's death and the sale of the property .
certainly my son never let it or allowed anyone to occupy it on either a temporary or permanent basis .
â€˜ my son is at present on holiday in tenerife with his wife and daughter .
i can not say precisely when i expect him to return , though i should suppose in about a week from now . â€™
it was all very small and quiet and low-key .
the snippet in rufus 's monday morning newspaper measured just an inch in depth .
it answered the question he had asked himself and told him that the bones of a very young child had been found as well as those of a young woman.
this was not a shock .
how could it be otherwise , since this was wyvis hall and the pine wood and the animal cemetery ?
to photograph the house for the news last night the cameraman must have stood just where he had stood himself , on the edge of the lawn with his back to the cedar tree .
a popular .
mass-produced camera he had used , but quite a good one .
one thing about zosie 's pilfering , she never stole rubbish .
he had taken a picture of her after that and one of the animal cemetery .
â€˜ why is the grass always so short up here ? â€™
adam had asked .
â€˜ rabbits , i expect . â€™
â€˜ why ca n't bloody rabbits come and eat my lawns ? â€™
adam always referred to â€˜ my lawns â€™ , â€˜ my house â€™ , â€˜ my furniture â€™ .
it had got up rufus 's nose a bit , though adam had a perfect right to do this .
it was his , all of it , and it went to his head rather .
nineteen-year-olds seldom inherit country mansions , after all .
it must have been some time in august when i took those pictures , rufus thought , and a couple of weeks later it was all over .
coincidentally , as the community and their lives together broke up , so did the weather .
it was raining intermittently all the time they were in the cemetery , the pines bowing and shivering in the wind .
sometimes they had had to stop and take shelter under the closely planted-trees .
if the weather had held and still been hot and dry would they have dug deeper ?
probably not .
in spite of the rain , the earth was still as hard as iron .
a sheet of rain had come down then , a hard , gusty shower , while they were laying the squares of turf back in place , and adam had said something about the rain making the grass grow quickly , the rain being on their side .
â€˜ we should all go our separate ways as soon as we can , â€™ rufus had said .
â€˜ we should pack up now and go . â€™
the spade and the fork they had hung up among the other tools in the stables .
they had packed and adam had locked up the house .
at some point rufus himself had taken the things out of the fridge and left the door open to defrost it .
adam closed the front door and stood there for a moment as if he could not wrench himself away .
so much of its beauty had been stripped from it by the whipping winds .
and by the neglect of the long hot summer .
a sudden gust of rain dashed against the red bricks that were already stained in patches by water .
the house that when he first saw it had seemed to float on a raft of golden mist , now lay in a wilderness , amidst ragged grass and straggling bushes and trees dead from the heat .
dirty grey clouds tumbled across the sky above the slate roof , now the only thing that shone , glazed with rain .
but rufus admitted to himself that the beauties of nature and architecture had never meant much to him .
it was the heat and sunshine and privacy he liked .
and now he longed only to get away .
they all got into goblander and he drove away up the drift , adam next to him , the others in the back .
the drift had become a tunnel of overgrowth that dripped water on to the roof of the van .
none of them allowed their eyes to turn towards the pine wood .
at the top they came out into uncompromising , bright grey light , the bleak , hedgeless lane , the flat meadows where here and there stunted trees squatted like old men in cloaks .
adam 's simile , not his , thought rufus with a grimace .
no one asked where he was taking them .
no one spoke .
adam had hilbert 's old golf-bag stuck between his legs and rufus guessed the gun was inside it .
they must have gone a good two miles before they met another car .
rufus overtook a bus going to colchester and dropped the two in the back so that they could catch it .
he took adam on to sudbury for him to catch a train there and at that point they parted .
adam got down from goblander and said ,
â€˜ for ever and for ever , farewell , rufus . â€™
which was probably a quotation from something , though rufus did not know what and thought fastidiously that it was in bad taste , histrionic , though just like adam .
â€˜ take care , â€™ said rufus , and not looking back any more than he had done when they returned from the cemetery , drove off round the town he had got to know so well , over the stour bridge , into essex , heading for halstead and dunmow and ongar and london .
he never had seen any of them again .
there had been no need to pretend , to turn aside .
briefly , starting his fifth year in medical school something over thirteen months later , he had wondered if shiva manjusri would be one of the incoming freshmen .
but no , his intuition had been accurate .
at any rate shiva 's face was not among the several brown faces .
as for the others , avoiding them had presented no problems .
would they get in touch with him now ?
no contingency plans had been made for this eventuality .
so long as there was no hunt for a missing girl they had felt themselves reasonably safe .
their minds had not reached out to the terror of what had in fact happened .
none of them had been the kind of people who could have imagined devotion to a pet animal or according to it funerary rites .
it was shiva who had proposed the site .
they had congratulated him on his ingenuity .
ten years â€¦
an ovarian cyst , nothing to get upset about , rufus told ms beauchamp .
she was thirty-two , an editor with a distinguished publishing house , married to an investigative journalist .
as yet they had no children , but she wanted four , she told rufus .
â€˜ no reason why you should n't . â€™
he had another glance at her notes .
â€˜ in fact , a peculiarity about this condition is that it seldom if ever occurs in a woman who 's had a baby . â€™
â€˜ my god , â€™ she said , putting her coat on , .
'and there was 1 , making my husband 's life a misery , sure i 'd got the dreaded c. â€™
they all thought they 'd got the dreaded c , poor things .
you could n't blame them .
rufus took her â£40 off her by the reception desk , having set in train the arrangements by which she would be admitted to a fashionable west end clinic , with rufus , her surgery and her hospitalization ultimately paid for by some provident association to which she and her husband subscribed .
rufus shook hands .
he walked back to his consulting room , dying for a cigarette .
this was unlike him .
he could usually get through quite easily until after lunch .
he thought , i know what my idea of heaven would be , if by heaven we mean a place of bliss in which to pass eternity : a sanctuary where one might chain-smoke without impairment of breathing , destruction of the lungs or damage to the heart , light each fresh cigarette from the glowing butt of its predecessor , and drink ice-free but hundred-proof chilled vodka laced with two drops of angostura and a gill of newly opened perrier endlessly , with increasing euphoria until a peak of joy and ease was reached but without any sub-sequent nausea or pain or dehydration or oblivion â€¦
sitting alone , he lit his cigarette , the first of the day , and there came that faint swimming in the head , a tautening of the gut .
he closed his eyes .
if it comes to light that i was in that house with adam and the others , he thought with cold clarity , if someone tells the papers , or the police and thence the papers , that i was there during the summer of 1976 , living there , it will be all up with me .
i will lose my practice and my reputation and everything that i have and can look forward to , if not my liberty .
and without the rest i sha n't care about my liberty .
it would be bad enough if i were a g p or an expert in some other branch of medicine , an orthopaedic surgeon , for instance , or an ear , nose and throat man , but i am a gynaecologist , and it is the bones of a young woman and a baby that have been found there â€¦
what worried woman would come to me ?
what mrs strawson or ms beauchamp ?
what gp would send her to me ?
if i were innocent , thought rufus , i know very well what i would do .
i would pick up the phone and phone my solicitor and ask to come and see him and get his advice .
he might advise me to make a statement to the police which i should of course do under his guidance .
but i shall not do this because i am not innocent .
i shall sit here and wait and sweat it out and look the facts in the face , trying to anticipate the worst that can happen .
the wonderful thing about the human mind , adam thought , is the way it copes when the worst happens .
beyond that worst happening you think there can be nothing , the unimaginable has taken place , and on the other side is death , destruction , the end .
but the worst happens and you reel from it , you stagger , the shock is enormous , and then you begin to recover .
you rally , you stand up and face it .
you get used to it .
an hour maybe and you are making contingency plans .
for what had happened was not the worst , you realized that .
the worst was yet to come , was perhaps always yet to come , never would actually come , because if it did you would know it , that would be reality , and there would be nothing then but to kill yourself .
quickly .
now that he was able to , he assembled what had happened and laid the facts before himself .
they had dug up those bones at wyvis hall and had decided it was murder they were investigating .
bones , skeletons , bodies , do not bury themselves .
those were the facts , as far as he knew them up to this moment .
he would know more , much more , in the days to come .
what was certain was that he could no longer use the escape key .
it was defunct .
the passages it cancelled had , in any case , as in certain programmes , not been lost but stored on some limbo disc from whence they must now be retrieved .
adam sat in his parents ' house , drinking tea .
there must be a total retrieval now , the one good thing about which was that it might banish his dreams .
he was aware of a slight feeling of sickness and of cold , an absence of hunger , though he had been feeling quite hungry when he got off the plane .
anne sat next to him on his mother 's cretonne-covered settee and abigail lay on a plaid rug on the floor , kicking with her legs and punching with her arms .
his mother kept poking toys which she did not want at her .
a passage from a novel by john o'hara came back to adam .
he had memorized it years ago in the ecalpemos epoch : â€˜ the safest way to live is first , inherit money , second , be born without taste for liquor , third , have a legitimate job that keeps you busy , fourth , marry a wife who will cooperate in your sexual peculiarities , fifth , join some big church , sixth , do n't live too long . â€™
apart from the last one which he had n't got to yet and the penultimate one which seemed to apply in america more than here ( here he had joined the golf club ) he had complied with all the rest .
or his nature and luck had complied for him .
nemesis had still come down like the wolf on the fold .
he had not wanted to come back here .
but there had been no spirit in him , the shock of what his father told him had been too great .
â€˜ something that will interest you , adam , something to make you sit up .
they 've dug up a lot of human bones at my old uncle 's house â€¦ â€˜
by the time he had rallied and got himself together and was thinking of things to say to the police it was too late and they were heading north .
anne was furious .
when lewis said to come back with him and eat there adam had got a kick on the ankle from anne and another kick when he had n't replied .
he had turned on her and said with cold savagery , â€˜ for fuck 's sake , stop kicking me , will you ? â€™
he expected his father to rise and say something about that being no way to speak to one 's wife or not in front of the child , he was capable of that .
but he had said nothing , only looked subdued , and adam realized why .
his own terrible fear and anger had communicated itself to his father and shown him what the better part of valour was : keeping silent .
having put the cat among the pigeons , made mischief in his special way , he was lying low now and waiting .
the old bastard .
adam only wished uncle hilbert had left him wyvis hall and then there would have been no ecalpemos , no zosie , and no deaths .
and adam could n't see he would have been much worse off .
he and anne would be living in a house like this one , rather than that neo-georgian palace .
children , after all , he thought , looking at abigail , were happy wherever they were , so long as they were loved â€¦
his parents had not asked him what sort of holiday he had had or how the flight had been .
the conversation was exclusively on the subject of the discovery at wyvis hall .
adam did not know whether to be glad or sorry he had not obtained an english newspaper while away .
if he had done the shock would have been less but on the other hand , his holiday would have been spoilt .
he would have liked very much to be alone .
of course he knew there was no possibility of this , now or when he returned home , for when you were married you never could be alone .
presumably that was the point .
what was he going to tell anne ?
how much was he going to tell her ?
he did n't know .
none of it , if he could help it .
they sat at the table in the dining area to eat an absurdly early high tea .
lewis asked him if he could remember the day when he heard he had inherited wyvis hall and had walked in here and astounded them with his news .
â€˜ he had a beard then , anne . â€™
lewis 's subdued air had changed to one of high good humour .
â€˜ you would n't have recognized him , he looked like john the baptist . â€™
adam could remember very well but he was n't going to say so .
â€˜ what a funny thing , â€™ said lewis .
â€˜ we had ham salad that day too .
what a coincidence !
oh , yes , i 've been meaning to ask you , who was it looked after wyvis hall while you were in greece ? â€™
adam could eat nothing .
the other time , he remembered , it was his father who had n't been able to eat .
he did n't know what lewis meant about someone looking after the house but no doubt he , adam , had at the time concocted some tale to keep his father quiet , to keep him away even .
â€˜ someone from the village , you said , â€™ lewis persisted .
â€˜ how can i remember that far back ? â€™
â€˜ the police will want to know .
it may be of vital importance . â€™
â€˜ are n't you going to eat your meat , dear ? â€™ said beryl .
abigail , who had been put upstairs in one of the bedrooms to sleep , set up a wailing sound .
adam was on his feet at once .
â€˜ i think we should go . â€™
they had to wait until his father was ready .
adam would have preferred to phone for a hire car but lewis would n't hear of it .
anne sat in the front in the passenger seat while adam was in the back with abigail .
if his father could have found out what flight they were coming on , the police certainly could .
it was possible they might be waiting for him .
they would wish to interview every former owner or occupant of wyvis hall .
he looked again at the newspaper account of the adjourned inquest that his father had saved for him .
it would be owners and occupants of wyvis hall between nine and twelve years before that they would wish to interview , and those were great-uncle hilbert , who was dead , himself and ivan langan to whom he had sold the house .
as for other occupants , how would they know who else had lived there ?
it was ironical that ten days before he had seen shiva at heathrow .
the encounter he now saw as an omen , a shadow cast by a coming event .
what would that event be ?
adam did not want at this point to speculate , it made hiâ€“ feel sick .
he turned the newspaper over so that he could not see that headline and those paragraphs .
in high spirits , his father was talking about the immense advances made in forensic science in recent years .
as soon as they got home , anne started getting abigail to bed .
their cases humped upstairs and put into the bedroom , adam looked rufus fletcher up in the phone book .
he was in there twice , at a wimpole street number and again at an address in mill hill : rufus h. fletcher , mb , mrcp .
all these years then , or for some of them , rufus had been living three or four miles from him .
he could n't look shiva up because he could n't remember his surname .
women marry and change their names , he thought , there was no point in pursuing that one .
of course he could look up robin tatian but where , really , would that get him ?
he was reaching-for the blue directory when anne came back with abigail in her arms , so adam took her and carried her back to bed himself and tucked her in and kissed her .
she was almost asleep .
he wondered if rufus had children and if so did he worry about them coming to terrible harm the way adam worried ?
was his whole life affected by what had happened at ecalpemos ?
adam might have escaped the file memories for years , suppressed them and jerked violently away from them , but he had never been able to pretend he was unscathed by those events .
sometimes he felt that he was the person he was because of them and acted the way he did because of their effects .
he sat by abigail 's cot , not wanting to remember , but knowing that now he must .
there was nothing in his house to remind him of ecalpemos .
everything that was left , everything he and rufus had n't sold , had gone to ivan langan with the house .
for a song , too , because he had not been able to bear the thought of going back , meeting a valuer , walking about the house , picking things off shelves and out of cupboards .
only once had he returned after they all left and that had been bad enough , like a dream â€” no , like stepping into the set and scenario of some frightening film , a hitchcock movie perhaps .
he asked the taxi he had taken to put him down at the top of the drift and he had walked to the house .
it was almost a year since he had been there and in that time nothing had been done , nothing had been touched .
from the pine wood he simply averted his eyes â€” till later .
the drift was thickly overgrown , a dank tunnel out of whose bushy sides the tendrils of brambles and briar roses caught at his clothes .
one of these whipped back at him and as he caught at it a thorn drove into the fleshy pad of his finger .
that thorn had been there , festering , for months .
a dull cool summer it had been , as different as could be from the year before .
no golden light bathed the red brick of the house .
it no longer looked mellow .
beautiful , yes , but severe somehow and , to adam 's heightened awareness , reproachful .
he found himself encouraging , fostering , the scenario illusion .
only thus , only by pretending unreality , pretending this was a part he acted , could he go on , cross the wild , shaggy grass , go past the black-branched cedar tree , arrive at the porch set in its four doric columns and insert his key in the lock .
conclusion
task analysis has not and can not be reduced to a set of standardised procedures which the aspiring analyst could acquire in a formal training course .
the techniques just described are no more than guidelines in what remains the creative art of studying and describing what an experienced worker is doing or will be required to do .
the danger in being too rigid is that justice will not be done to the flexibility and complexity of human performance .
the danger of being too flexible is that the ergonomists will have an inadequate basis from which to design interfaces , training courses and other operator aids .
if a comprehensive task description can be completed then it is legitimate to enquire why the task can not be allocated to a technical device rather than a human being .
yet without a reasonably comprehensive task description the total system performance may be unreliable or unpredictable .
there is a necessary compromise which can only be arrived at in the context of a particular system .
as mentioned earlier there are always the twin problems of how to get the information and how to present it .
it is sometimes easier to proceed on the basis of : â€˜ if i were doing the job this is how i would do it â€™ , but this can be delusory even for analysts who have past experience as operators .
for analysts who are designers creating a new task there may be no alternative , but any task description arrived at by this method should be checked against the behaviour of real operators as they gain experience .
a particular difficulty about task synthesis is that there is no easy way of confirming completeness .
a task description which is part of a design process should be fully â€” documented in terms of the origins of information , the assumptions made and the methods used .
the standard method of producing task descriptions is to write all the separate sub-tasks at various levels on cards and then assemble the cards in a network .
there is a temptation to make these final diagrams very large , but often it is more useful to separate into small units with cross-referencing .
the optimum size seems to be a3 , this is easily copied and circulated but is large enough to contain considerable detail .
the procedure can be computerised , there are programmes available for the easy production , manipulation and storage of block diagrams with useful cross-referencing facilities .
there is an inherent difficulty in that often the main dividend from a task analysis is from the act of obtaining it .
those not involved find it difficult to gain very much from a presentation of a task description .
like reference books , they have to be used rather than read .
task analysis can be very expensive in skilled manpower , but in looking at cost/value it is important to include in value the increase in mutual understanding which occurs when a multi-disciplinary team conducts the analysis .
if such a team is used the required man-hours can be optimised by using the delphi method rather than a long series of group meetings .
political , economic and social issues which arise in conducting task analyses are discussed in the context of job analysis ( p. 148 ) .
application
man-power planning
the â€˜ human resource â€™ concept of man-power as the central profitâ­m_generating asset of any organisation has made some progress over the past twenty years .
there was particular interest around 1970 when companies were prosperous , stable and innovative ( ipm , 1972 , patten , 1971 ) .
the objective is to revise and almost reverse the traditional accountancy concept of man-power as a resource consuming factor requiring regular payments , overheads in the form of heated , lighted , equipped workspaces and so on .
from the narrow accountancy viewpoint , people are a cost and it is desirable to keep this cost as low as possible .
in these terms it is very difficult to justify , for example , sending a member of staff on a training course .
the training requires expenditure and so also does the replacement for the person away .
where is the return ?
the return is actually in the improved human resource but this is not readily measurable in terms which accountants use .
there have been two attempts to reduce human resources to this form of measurement ( giles and robinson , 1972 ) .
one is to acquire a human asset multiplier for each level of staff .
the multiplier for manual staff might be unity but it increases with staff level and becomes three or more for management .
the other is to add together all the personnel costs for each kind of worker from the original job advertisement through to the retirement or redundancy payments .
the first does attempt to obtain a value , the second remains essentially a cost and not a value .
it would be unduly optimistic to assume that management skills have risen to a level such that costs undertaken can be assumed to be equivalent to value .
a less direct measure which is applicable only to the most senior management is to observe the fall or rise of the share price when a particular executive leaves or joins a company .
this can be very high , for a large company a change in market value of millions of pounds is not unusual .
the most serious consequence of the accountancy view of man-power is that high level policy decision-making does not give this factor sufficient weight .
for example , the main board of a company will have complete details of cost and values of physical resources such as buildings and equipment but relatively scanty data about the man-power which is their most important asset .
indeed it will be described almost entirely as a liability because the costs will be known .
similarly , broad factors such as the state of morale will again only be described by negative features such as absenteeism , stoppages , strikes , low quality output and so on .
it is obvious that company output and projects must reflect the man-power and its performance level , but , if this is acknowledged at all , it is only in brief verbal terms within , for example , the chairman 's annual report .
the obsession , of current management , with measurement and the reduction of every variable to numbers for ease of computer manipulation has worsened the situation .
unfortunately there is no easy remedy .
human resources are too complex a variable to be easily susceptible to measurement beyond the level of counting heads and trades .
key variables such as the quality of staff at any level and the current morale are only expressible in general verbal descriptive terms .
it is generally accepted ( p. 145 ) that â€˜ hygiene â€™ type variables such as pay and working conditions can , if they are inappropriately specified , depress morale and motivation but they will not in themselves result in very high levels of these parameters .
morale and motivation are influenced more by conditions of work in the sense of work variety opportunities and attitudes of management .
these factors are worthy of emphasis because in practice they are still dealt with very badly in many organisations and yet it takes little trouble or expertise to make an enormous difference .
for example , very few senior managements take the trouble to keep workers fully informed about policies and likely changes .
the result is excessive reliance on rumour and continuous speculation which is not only time-consuming but is also highly deleterious in morale terms .
the two human factors which can be unambiguously measured are age and sex .
the age distribution of a work force is always an interesting and important source of information .
for most purposes a rectangular distribution is the most desirable because it provides the appropriate mix of youthful enthusiasm and ageing experience .
it also makes for regular changes as staff retire and are replaced .
many distributions show a peak in a particular age group mainly associated with taking on a large number of young people when the organisation was started or reorganised , this is not desirable because it leads to excessive competition for promotion at particular stages .
these comments are obviously most relevant for work forces where there is little tendency to move out , this is characteristic of a surprisingly large number of organisations in european countries and in japan but much less so in the u.s.a.
stable work forces have their advantages in terms of familiarity with the enterprise and its peculiar needs but they do result in problems if the market for the products is erratic or otherwise unpredictable .
this is particularly so in high technology e.g. design and construction of ships , aircraft , power stations and chemical plant , where the product unit is large and expensive and the variety of required expertise is extensive .
some peaks of demand can be dealt with by using consultants , but they tend to be expensive and do not always fit well with ill-defined but important factors such as the favoured style of the organisation .
in well ordered systems it may be possible to calculate the length of in-house experience required to achieve the required level of expertise in particular topics and compare this with the lead time for particular product requirements .
given time available to train new staff it is not necessary to keep more than a nucleus in that particular expertise .
on the other hand , if there is usually insufficient notice of need it may be necessary to keep staff who have periods with little to do between projects .
it is also desirable to have the possibility of shifting staff between design and operational duties .
this not only provides flexibility in the use of man-power , it also improves communication .
these real difficulties of man-power utilisation are such as to force many organisations to become larger and larger if they are to remain economic .
size provides a cushion to the vicissitudes of markets but it creates other problems .
for example , difficulties of communications and in particular , how to inculcate the feeling within each individual that he and his performance are important to the organisation .
this is considered in more detail in chapter 3 .
human resources should be fundamental to subjects such as ergonomics which are essentially people-centred but the concept remains procedurally undeveloped at any level from a continent through countries , regions and companies down to particular working systems .
this is one reason why policy makers never seem to take account fully of the people affected by their decisions .
the design of procedures
the increased importance of standardised informational support for both machines and operators has led to the concept of procedures as a separate design issue within a system ( fig. 1.30 ) .
much of this information can be incorporated in computer programs but there is also a need for extensive printed paper for the use of the operator .
this takes three main forms : checklists , routines and knowledge-texts .
the terminology in this field is not standardised .
software might be restricted , as in this book , to computer programs but it is sometimes used as the generic term to include all sources of information .
procedures is sometimes used for what are here called routines and sometimes to indicate all the operator 's information support except software .
the situation is further confused when some but not all the operator information support is itself computer-based .
sometimes the term firm-ware is used .
however whatever the terminology used there is a requirement for design effort .
the quality of procedures would be much improved if designers followed some simple guide-lines ( table 1.16 ) .
many documents are written on the implicit assumption that the reader is much like the writer in terms of expertise and style of thinking .
similarly it is assumed that the conditions under which the reading will take place are the same as those of writing which are usually a clean well-lit office .
they may have to be read in the open air , in rain and darkness or within a plant under oily , cramped , poorly lit conditions .
the user probably has limited expertise and he may be working under various stress conditions .
the material on which the information is printed , the typeface used , the sequence , the structure and the format generally should reflect the conditions of use , ( easterby and zwaga , 1984 ) .
all these things can be achieved if it is acknowledged that all procedures should a validated by users under the normal conditions of use .
checklists
checklists are used in the pre-start mode , for routine maintenance and for fault-finding .
they normally take the form of a series of questions or statements which the operator uses to guide and structure his inspection of the hardware and other system components .
the sequence is dictated by the optimal order in which actions should be taken , for example in starting up an aircraft .
there are many situations when the order is of no great consequence , for example a safety audit of a new machine , and in this latter case some logical structure is needed .
as mentioned above , the logic of the design may not be the optimal basis if the way the operator thinks and acts is different .
baker ( 1984 ) suggests that four kinds of shortcoming emerge when checklists are validated in the real situation .
the operator may deviate from the listed procedure because it may require excessive moving about or because he is interrupted by the requirements of other tasks .
systematic use of a checklist often reveals faults in work design such as inadequate access , visibility and labelling .
the checklist itself may be inconsistent , incomplete , imprecise or ambiguous .
finally the checklist may have reprographic limitations such as inadequate vertical or horizontal structure , poor typefaces and insufficient linking of requirements , descriptions , remarks and tick-off points .
the international ergonomics association developed a general ergonomics checklist which is reproduced in edholm ( 1967 ) .
there is a deceptive simplicity about such lists which requires extensive effort to ensure a comprehensive but coherent content .
the context is , of course , the context of ergonomics as conceived by the designers of the list .
routines
a routine is the most common form of instructional material .
the reader is required to follow a series of steps which might , for example , introduce a change in the performance of a complex system .
normally routines are single chains of instructions although it is possible to have some conditional branching .
each step should be simple and complete in itself â€” preferably with some indication that successful completion has been achieved , for example the appearance or the change of colour of a signal light , or the noise of a motor starting or a change of pressure which indicates that there has been a change in the flow of some material .
as mentioned earlier a routine can often be regarded as a written task description .
by definition and design intention routines are inflexible .
the user is intended to behave exactly according to their instruction .
no great skill or intellectual effort is required , which is one way of saying that the human operator is being under-used , but the purpose of a routine is usually to avoid common human error such as omitting a step or reversing steps .
in general the value of formal routines is precisely that the operator , left to himself , will not normally function in such a systematic sequential manner .
knowledge texts
knowledge is contained in documents which may vary from single sheet presentations to large manuals .
as instructional material it is indirect in that the reader is not necessarily told what to do , as in a routine .
rather he is informed about the situation and the purpose of informing him is to provide a knowledge base from which he can work out his own actions .
nevertheless , the relevant action remains important and the knowledge provided should be carefully and stringently selected .
it is too easy to follow the academic tradition and provide knowledge for its own sake .
the â€˜ need to know â€™ criterion is crucial because unless it is applied , the operator can be overburdened with unnecessary material .
correspondingly the material should be structured in terms of how it is most likely to be used .
in this context the operator requires a guide for action and not a scientific text-book .
it is invariably better to provide material diagrammatically , systematically or at least in well-structured short paragraphs rather than in flowing prose .
consider for example how readily information about the relative position of streets is available from a map of a town centre rather than a verbal description of all the streets .
such a map will enable the reader to work out for himself how to get from one location to another within the town .
note the enormous flexibility compared with a routine which would tell him only how to get from one particular point to another .
a second important difference is that if he misses his place in a routine he will be totally lost , whereas if he happens to go in the wrong direction while using a map he is still able to make whatever correction is necessary .
however the map does require more intellectual effort than does the routine not only in making decisions about how to proceed but also in filtering out the required information from the massive irrelevance ( for a particular task ) which is equally available .
thus , one would expect the use of the maps to be slower than the use of routines with the human performance being more versatile but less predictable .
with two-dimensional representations such as maps it remains important to avoid too much homogeneity and provide substructure in the form of main roads and key buildings or other features such as rivers .
see , for example , fig. 5.3
manuals which may contain maps , schematic diagrams and other materials warrant separate consideration .
the design of manuals
a manual is usually in the form of a book or booklet which is sent with the hardware from the maker to the customer .
it is part of the communication package from the designer to the user .
thus it is a particular form of job aid which provides the operator with information on a system and its performance .
the standard of manual design has traditionally been very low for several reasons .
for this purpose , the designer is too familiar with the product and he rarely takes the trouble to find out what the user really needs to know .
often the manual has to be provided hurriedly at the end of a project when the budget is running out , and it is regarded as a tiresome chore still required after the essential design work has been completed .
the problem is particularly acute for computers .
manuals for cars , machine tools and so on are poor but at least it is possible to observe the mechanisms and their functions .
most computer operators do not know or wish to know about the mechanisms , and in any case these are not accessible to vision and manipulation .
the computer operator is entirely dependent on the manual , at least in the early stages of gaining familiarity with the system and its functions .
he is usually very badly served although the principles of manual design are well known .
for most systems the manual is best divided into parts as indicated in table 1.17 .
the first part should be a general introduction which orientates the readers towards the system , its purpose , its functional structure and mode of operation and its performance limits .
this should be followed by a separate section on how to set the system up in the first place and how to check that it is working properly .
if it is fairly small it may be necessary to describe how to unpack it , fix it into position , connect it to power supplies and start it up .
if it is large , the emphasis will be on the start up procedure .
the section describing the operation of the system should cover not only how the system operates but also how the user can operate it .
extensive use of line drawings , schematic diagrams , algorithmic lists is desirable , and where prose is used this also should be structured into short sentences with meaningful separation into paragraphs .
the maintenance section should indicate what , if anything , the operator is expected to do and the symptoms which indicate that more specialist maintenance skills are required .
tables subdivided into faults/reasons/m_remedies can be extremely helpful .
parts lists including description reference numbers and sometimes drawings are necessary if the user is expected to deal with his own replacements .
a standard fault is to assume that the reader is familiar with the jargon which the designer habitually uses .
a glossary of terms and acronyms used can be very helpful not only to the reader but also to the writer who is forced to consider carefully how he is using various technical terms .
finally , all manuals should end with an index which supplements the table of contents at the beginning .
attempting to integrate under fives
policy in islington , 1983â€“8
margaret boushel , clare debenham , lisa dresner and anna gorbach
during the 1980s margaret boushel , claire debenham , lisa dresner and anna gorbach worked in the london borough of islington within social services for pre-school children .
this chapter is an account of the way they perceived attempts to develop integrated provision for under fives and the barriers in attitudes and systems which were encountered .
the first section provides an overview of provision and services in 1983 .
the next section describes attempts to create a clear under-fives policy .
the third section looks at the faltering progress towards integrated services .
the fourth section examines the formidable barriers that were posed by reorganisation of social services , local authority cuts and the demise of the inner london education authority .
the chapter concludes with a mixture of resignation and determination .
background : under-fives services in islington , 1983
islington is a multi-ethnic , inner city london borough with a child population of 29,000 .
in 1982 , 44 per cent of under fives in islington had the use of an under-fives facility , 29 per cent on a full-time and 15 per cent on a part-time basis .
between 1982 and 1988 provision gradually increased , so that by 1988 there were 12 children 's day centres , about 70 playgroups and 350 assisted child-minding places funded partially or totally by the social services department , and 1,075 full-time and 824 part-time places in nursery schools funded by the inner london education authority .
the beacon nursery , a local mencap project , offered care five days per week to children over one year of age categorised as having severe learning difficulties .
unlike council day centres , playgroups or community nurseries , the beacon nursery was free .
children were collected from home by special bus and places were available on demand .
the beacon had been in existence for many years and in the past had catered for up to thirty children with a wide range of disabilities and needs .
by 1983 it had half that number on roll .
since 1983 numbers at the beacon continued to fall as it was increasingly seen as a resource for children with severe and multiple disabilities .
in addition the elfreda rathbone organisation , a voluntary organisation helping people with learning disabilities , ran a free day nursery in the borough for a small number of children with learning difficulties .
some integrated services emerged in the early 1980s â€” one playscheme was developed through a parent 's initiative , and an integrated adventure playground was established by a voluntary organisation .
workers from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported a local special school in integrating under fives into a playgroup .
in addition to its mainstream schools , the borough included five special schools providing primary and secondary education to children with special needs from islington and neighbouring boroughs â€” one for children with moderate learning difficulties , one for children with severe learning difficulties , one for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties , one for autistic children , and one for children with physical disabilities .
in 1983 three of these offered nursery places to children from the age of 2 .
the children using all of these services came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds , though rarely was this actively and positively reflected in the type of care provided or the ethnic background of their carers .
residential units
by 1983 residential services were designed with â€˜ care in the community â€™ in mind , but most were based in specialist settings .
for example , field end house had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with learning difficulties , and was designed to offer respite â€˜ round the clock â€™ care .
parents had fought for this as a local resource to prevent the need for children to be placed in long-stay placements far from home .
by 1988 field end had been joined by another specialist children 's respite care unit at leigh road .
the social services department also provided thirteen short-term and long-term residential units for children in care ( by 1988 their number had been reduced to eleven ) , none with wheelchair access and only one with any experience of caring for children with learning difficulties .
the community health team
the community health team had major responsibility for assessing children and recommending provision .
it included physiotherapists , occupational and speech therapists , doctors , psychologists and a specialist health visitor .
they were joined in the network by specialist teachers , funded by the ilea and based in the special schools , who visited children at home before they were due to start school .
this group of people met on a regular basis to coordinate services and discuss professional issues .
discussion of services to individual children also took place .
this included deciding between day care or school , and parents ' attitudes to different options .
often a member of the group was delegated to advise parents on a course of action .
the community health team aim was to ensure a place of treatment for children from the earliest possible age , to enable them to develop to their fullest potential .
they were , however , an all-white group , operating without directly involving parents and were generally committed to specialist care in the community .
they gave support to the beacon and elfreda rathbone nurseries and most members saw these settings as the best places to â€˜ treat â€™ children .
because of their early contact with parents they often had considerable influence in steering parents towards specialist provision .
the special services team
in the early 1980s social workers were funded jointly by the ilea and islington social services department to work with children attending two special schools and two specialist units for â€˜ partially hearing â€™ children .
these social workers were based in the borough 's special services team .
they all worked with some under fives attending the schools they covered .
they were aware of a number of pre-school children who did not have adequate access to resources or support when parents and professionals were becoming aware of the possible extent and implications of the disability .
when a vacancy arose within this group of social workers in 1983 it was decided to appoint someone specialising in work with under fives with special needs .
this might have had the effect of drawing families into the specialist system at an earlier stage .
instead , for a number of reasons , it proved to be a key step in the development of the debate about integration in islington .
first , the post was not attached to any specialist institution .
there was an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely with the beacon nursery .
second , the worker had an alternative peer group of under-fives workers who were key figures in controlling access to all other under-fives facilities .
third , the worker was committed to the idea that treatment of a medical or disabling condition should not take precedence over the child 's social , emotional and cultural needs .
there was now a new worker in the network who also made an early relationship with families but who could present a broader choice of day care to parents .
attempting an integration policy
the labour council , elected in 1982 , had as a stated policy aim that every child whose parents so wished was entitled to a pre-school place of some sort .
this led to the initiation of an under-fives review .
the review team , set up under the auspices of the social services committee , included councillors , senior departmental management and representatives of the children 's day centre organisers and under-fives social workers in its membership .
it proposed a network of under-fives centres throughout the borough â€” an idea which the under-fives workers had been anxious to promote for some time .
day care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the children 's day centres which would also provide information , support and resources to parents .
the review had made no mention of children with special needs .
the specialist social worker and another under-fives worker with a personal interest in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources for these children .
they interviewed parents , specialist professionals and mainstream day-care workers and they designed a questionnaire which was completed by workers in a large proportion of mainstream council services and voluntary organisations , as well as by some child-minders .
broadly , the survey confirmed that parents of children with special needs had not been given a real choice of placement , and that they had to fight hard for mainstream provision if this was their choice .
parents wanted to be part of the decision-making and did not feel that they were .
many commented on lack of information about the range of facilities on offer .
one afro-caribbean woman described how she felt that she was never given a choice of provision for her son , and objected to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good .
she fought hard to get him a part-time playgroup place in the group his older brother attended .
because the group had known her and her children for some time they agreed to â€˜ have a go â€™ and the placement went ahead .
she commented :
i had to fight every step of the way for this .
no one told me about it , and no one wanted him to have it .
i knew it was right for him â€” this is where he learnt to join in and be like other children .
it does n't matter that he 's not like them .
i know what is right for my child , but i 'm not supposed to say .
parents also wanted an increased availability of specialist â€˜ therapy â€™ time , but wanted it to be used in a more flexible way .
some parents were very worried that more integrated settings would lead to lack of attention for children with special needs .
definitions of â€˜ special needs â€™ varied widely in the questionnaire responses â€” some defining it as children with disabilities , some including children with behavioural and emotional problems and some including children whose first language was not english .
this made the survey difficult to interpret .
the findings were documented in a report a place for all our children ( ccuf 1983 ) and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special needs , with suggestions for how these might be overcome .
these ideas were informed by a paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local mencap group , who had previously tried to generate the debate within the community health service through the mencap committee .
the conference : â€˜ a place for all our children'
as a result of this work the coordinating committee for under fives ( ccuf ) , an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector groups and individuals providing a service to under fives , decided to organise a conference to look at the issues of integration of special needs children within mainstream provision .
prior to the conference various groups met to produce short contributions to the debate .
these included parents , under-fives workers , specialist workers , children 's day centre organisers and playgroups organisers .
each of these groups came up with a list of proposals which were sent to everyone attending .
about 230 people attended the conference , held in april 1985 .
workshops facilitated by the speakers and the conference organising group examined integration policies , overcoming practical problems for children in integrated provision and available sources of information .
the conference made the following recommendations :
1
for a formal , universal information system , covering local and specialist resources .
2
for children 's needs to be considered with parents and their wishes acknowledged and recognised .
3
for employment of extra staff where needed , and employment of peripatetic special needs workers .
4
for availability of money for equipment , toys and adaptations .
5
for enhanced payments to child-minders caring for children with special needs .
6
for priority status for children with special needs in order to facilitate access to ordinary provision .
7
for training facilities for staff in ordinary provision , specialist provision and child-minders .
8
for greater communication and sharing of resources between ordinary and specialist provision .
9
for therapeutic and professional staff to reflect the cultural backgrounds of the children , and that for all children , including those with special needs , their day-care environment and activities to express a consciousness of the multicultural society in islington .
it was made clear that all of the above areas needed funding from health , education and social services before they could be implemented .
finally , it was felt that unless the attitudes of advisers and information-givers became more positive towards integration , none of the recommendations could be effective .
( d ) warfare and crusades
the poet marbod of rennes celebrated ( in latin ) the vengeance which would befall a wicked castellan and his troops :
the poem highlights two important twelfth-century developments : the use of force in punishing aristocratic crime ( the fruit of princely peace-keeping ) , and the increasing significance of siege-engines in warfare .
intellectuals claimed a formative influence in the second too : john of marmoutier declared that monks from his own monastery had read vegetius ' de re militari to geoffrey le bel when he was investing the castle of a rebellious castellan , and ascribed his success to their advice on firebombs .
but common sense may have been more important than learning in perceiving the vulnerability of most castles to â€” battering-rams and catapults ; for even in 1100 they were , as a rule , primitive structures .
siege-engines demanded on the one hand skilled operators , and on the other a plentiful supply of unskilled labourers to move the necessary materials .
this effectively restricted their use to the wealthy and to those whose claim to assistance under the ban was incontrovertible .
equally , the improvements in fortification needed to withstand their effects â€” thick stone walls , inner as well as outer defences â€” required incomes greater than those of simple lords .
the net effect was that , given dedication , princes â€” louis vi , geoffrey le bel , alphonse-jourdain â€” could subdue rebellious castellans within their own demesnes , and could build castles of their own which were impregnable to all but lengthy and sustained attack .
henry ii 's castle at chinon , where the treasury of anjou was situated , was the model for its generation , with its halls , upper chambers , tower , and curtain walling , set on a high point above a strategic crossing of the loire .
it could be copied only either by those of nearly equal wealth or by those who could concentrate their resources chiefly on defence â€” princes , great bishops or , in the south especially , towns .
all others became vulnerable .
john of salisbury 's comment that not only the towns but also the fortresses of gaul feared henry i of england was revealing of the new situation .
similarly , campaigning in the field imposed an increasing financial burden .
the treaty between robert ii of flanders and henry i of england , renewed by their successors , stipulated that each knight supplied to the english king should bring three horses with him â€” this at a time when a horse represented a major investment .
then knightly armour grew more elaborate and costly throughout the century .
and though some knights might be supplied free by feudal service , household ones had to be maintained by their lords , mercenary ones needed pay , and those with money-fiefs constituted a regular charge on the treasury .
besides , away from their home base , knights were useless on their own .
in open battle and in the plundering expeditions that constituted the normal form of aggressive warfare , they needed the backing of archers , both mounted and on foot , and of numerous infantrymen .
the usual source of supply was town militias â€” suger mentions those of rheims , chã¢lons , laon , soissons , orlã©ans , etampes , and paris in the royal army of 1124 .
but they might have to be supplemented by mercenaries from flanders and the low countries , where the rapidly expanding population forced large numbers of young men into military careers .
in the eyes of the faithful , these â€˜ brabanters â€™ , with their freebooting and lack of discipline after the end of campaigns , were as dangerous as heretics ; in 1171 frederick barbarossa and louis vii agreed to expel them from their lands .
their value in battle , as shields behind which the knights could shelter before they launched their charge , ensured their continued employment by those who could afford them â€” notably henry ii of england .
but the hatred they aroused meant that they were liable to be brutally slaughtered if captured afterwards .
inevitably , therefore , war on the grand scale as fought by princes bore little resemblance in practice to the feuds of lesser men .
the divergence was sharpened by the application of a theoretical distinction , the fruit of augustinian theology , amplified as the century went on by canon and roman law reference ; princes pronounced their campaigns just wars ( fought against aggressors with the aim of re-establishing peace ) or public wars ( declared by a competent authority in the public interest ) , while they condemned the wars of lesser men as infractions of the peace .
geoffrey martel had perceived the propaganda potential of public war as early as the mid eleventh century ; later it enabled henry the liberal of champagne to claim the military service of all lords within his county , a reapplication of the carolingian ban .
so it could be a powerful weapon .
yet the logic of the definition suggested that it would benefit especially kings , whose competence to declare war could not be impugned : thus thibaud of blois failed to persuade the monks of marmoutier that they owed him service when he fought against louis vi ; they claimed discretion in the matter ; and in 1184 , the mighty philip of alsace hesitated to commit to battle the army he had summoned against philip augustus , through fear that its ranks might melt away .
the contrast with the united front louis vi and his troops presented to the emperor henry v in 1124 was marked .
a royal banner now bestowed respectability on a cause ; kings ' wars were assumed to be for the sake of peace , even when cripplingly expensive and increasingly savage .
this goes some way to explaining why the complicated campaigns within toulouse in the second half of the century were largely fought out under the banners of the angevin , aragonese , and french kings ; and why the revolts of henry ii 's sons had widespread ramifications .
the twelfth century was characterized , therefore , by fewer but more protracted wars , which smouldered for long periods between short , sharp bouts of conflict , like the war that covered must of the reigns of henry i of england and louis vi of france , the one inaugurated by the great rebellion of 1173 , which outlived both louis vii and henry ii , or that against catalan claims in the south .
into these large numbers of local conflicts were subsumed .
the pattern caused problems , in that the circumstances which might trigger off renewed fighting were unpredictable ; yet the moment an opportunity offered , princes had to be prepared for invading their enemies ; there was no time for lengthy preparation .
the usual tactic was to march troops across the enemy 's territory , plundering and looting ; to take fortified places if the task was easy ; to obtain allies among the lords of the locality ; and to retreat without fighting a battle if at all possible â€” in effect an application to a wider canvas of the some technique of warfare which had earlier made castellans formidable in the immediate environs of their castles .
it necessitated the rapid mobilization of auxiliaries to join a core of highly-trained troops kept constantly , at the ready â€” the princes ' military households , which became the linch pin of the system .
john of marmoutier 's life of geoffrey le bel offers a glimpse of how strong bonds were created between the prince and his followers within the household , and how a high level of training was maintained at all times .
geoffrey was brought up from infancy with the sons of neighbouring angevin lords , on whose companionship he relied .
when it came time for him to be knighted by henry i in rouen , he set off for normandy with a crowd of these young men about him .
in rouen , the occasion was celebrated with pomp , elaborate dress , and a great feast , and then the youths all demonstrated their military skill at a grand tournament , at which geoffrey naturally won the highest honours .
it was within this kind of environment that chivalry flourished , that young men learned to identify , their vassalage towards their lord as a symbol of their honour , that they debated the relative merits of roland 's and oliver 's way of displaying loyalty ; and that they learned the finer points of jousting .
tournaments were disapproved of by ecclesiastics , for they could be both bloody and dangerous .
yet they supplied real needs : .
that of an instruction in the martial arts compatible with the maintenance of a prince 's peace ; that of an outlet for competitive instincts within the claustrophobic confines of a court ; and that of display to maintain princely social status .
so they flourished everywhere .
they offered opportunities for men of skill to acquire great position in the world â€” arnoul of ardres caught the eye of countess ida of boulogne through his exploits ; and they also conferred lustre on the great â€” geoffrey le bel and philip of alsace were throughout france for their distinguished performances in these show battles .
all this formed a background to the first century of crusading ; and it goes some way to explaining the more secular aspects of the magnetism which drew french knights to take up the cross in their thousands .
urban ii , launching the first crusade at clermont in 1095 , presented it as a natural evolution of the peace movement : warriors were to forget their petty feuds and squabbles in a campaign to promote the interests of holy church .
the war , declared by one whose moral authority was unimpeachable , was to free the eastern churches , to end muslim guardianship of the holy places , to restore jerusalem to its proper state .
as princes saw it , it was a just war in the fullest sense of the term ; those who were slaughtered in its battles were regarded as among the martyrs of the church .
when raymond of toulouse , robert ii of flanders , robert curthose , stephen of blois , and hugh of vermandois responded to the call , past and present members of their military households fell almost automatically into rank behind them , to test themselves against terrible dangers , but also to enjoy the companionship in arms , the adventure , the deeds of daring which were the stuff of the chansons de geste .
that they shared , along with all other participants in the crusade , a fervent devotion , a conviction that their sins would be forgiven , is certain .
yet for them crusading necessitated no large leap of the imagination , no millenarian vision ; it was simply a challenging and a deserving extension of their everyday activities .
in french eyes , the hero of the first crusade was robert ii of flanders .
while raymond of toulouse remained in outremer , stephen and hugh disgraced themselves in escaping from the siege of antioch , and robert curthose , no matter how gallant , at least in his lifetime failed to impress , robert ii 's prestige soared to the skies .
he became robert of jerusalem to his contemporaries ; his deeds were recorded in the song of antioch ; his pious bravery totally expunged the memory of robert the frisian 's usurpation ; and after his death his son baldwin vii harped on his father 's achievement to justify his substantial use of coercion against the enemies of the church .
outside flanders , robert 's sister 's marriage to roger of sicily was a mark of his new position in the world ; like louis vi 's sister 's marriage to bohemond of antioch , it stretched french kinship connections into the new norman colonies , ensuring that travellers from the homeland would find a welcome in those distant parts .
robert 's example was a potent one .
after the next change in dynasty , thierry and philip of alsace strengthened their shaky claim to the comital position by attaining for themselves the prestige attached to being the outstanding crusaders of their generation .
thierry 's remote connection with the family of godfrey de bouillon , along with his marriage with sybilla of anjou , fulk v 's daughter , gave him some claim to the throne of jerusalem ; as a consequence , the aristocracy of outremer viewed him and philip with mixed feelings , expecting much of them , yet fearing their ambitions .
in the end , it was not in outremer but in the newly conquered byzantine empire that the flemish crusading achievement was crowned with the elevation of count baldwin ix to the imperial throne in 1204 .
but in the twelfth century , the house of alsace could afford the high costs of their expeditions â€” thierry went to jerusalem four times , philip twice â€” and the counts ' repeated absences in fact promoted administrative reform ; the baillis and the grote bref were as much the products of crusading as the english and norman judicial system and exchequers were the product of the king-duke 's divided attentions .
but if , on balance , the flemish counts benefited materially from crusading , â€” as , arguably , did the angevin â€” they were far from typical .
for other french houses a commitment to outremer often represented a sacrifice of domestic political interest .
the achievements of raymond iv st gilles in consolidating his authority within toulouse were threatened by his departure in 1095 , especially since it was known that he had no intention of returning home .
then his example lured his elder son bertrand to tripoli in 1112 , and his younger son alphonse jourdain there in 1147 .
had not his grandson raymond v fulfilled his crusading obligation in his early youth , thereby freeing himself from the necessity of interrupting his career in the county , the principality of toulouse might have disintegrated altogether .
william ix 's crusade of 1101 brought about serious financial problems in aquitaine which caused rapid devaluation in the hitherto stable currency ; and robert curthose 's decision to mortgage normandy to william rufus in order to cover his crusading expenses exacerbated a conflict over the duchy which was not settled until the death of his son william clito in 1128 .
all in all , it was not surprising that suger , mulling over the precedents of early crusading , tried to dissuade louis vii from embarking on his jerusalem journey in 1145 .
yet the appeal of crusading was , if anything , even stronger to those aristocratic houses just below the level of the princely : it was , after all , the house of boulogne which produced the first two rulers of jerusalem .
the counts of nevers , the lords of montpellier , the lords of amboise and lusignan , the trencavels , were fervent devotees of the ideal ; so the problems of absences , shipwrecks , death abroad plagued them as much as their princes .
on occasion , their determination to sacrifice for christ played directly into their overlord 's hands , as when the count of la marche , who had no direct heir , sold his county to king henry ii in 1177 .
when it did not , accompanying their princes in a joint crusading venture , as the lord of amboise accompanied fulk v or hugh vi de lusignan william ix , created new personal links .
the political spin-offs from crusading are therefore more difficult to calculate than at first glance they might appear .
nevertheless it is clear that the chief gainer was louis vii .
the irony of this lay in the fact that the second crusade was counter-productive in outremer , embittered relations with byzantium , and resulted in the deaths of enormous numbers of its participants , particularly those drawn from the nonâ­aristocratic classes .
yet it consolidated the king 's position within france , partly through the skilled regency of suger , but also because , in taking on himself the leadership of the expedition , louis re-emerged as a credible ruler of men .
his noble gesture appeased those churchmen who had been appalled by his early obstinacy over the archbishopric of bourges .
the disasters that befell his army paradoxically heightened his personal charisma : even the barons of outremer continued to look on him as their one potential saviour .
his friendship with raymond v of toulouse , a fellow warrior , reversed the trend of history since the middle of the tenth century , in bringing the princes of the far south back into the king 's mouvance .
the crowds of burgundians who accompanied the king learned to respect him ; on their return , they sought the arbitration of the royal court in their disputes , and they welcomed louis 's intervention within the counties that fringed the duchy of burgundy .
as william of st denis put it ,
even as early as 1147 it was apparent that the crusading movement had provided a new sense of aristocratic cohesion in the realm .
the great joint expeditions , the combined leaderships , although not without friction , had been justified by their outstanding achievement , the conquest and maintenance of jerusalem .
they were the gesta francorum , the deeds of the franks , or the gesta dei per francos , god 's deeds performed through the franks , as two of their earliest chroniclers entitled them .
but what was missing before 1147 was a clear sense of who the franks were .
the second crusade , however , was launched with st bernard 's ringing appeal to the count and barons of brittany :
in taking his place at the head of the second crusade , the rex francorum decisively hastened the transformation of the franks into the french .
revival under law , 1911â€“1914
few contemporaries would have expected balfour 's retirement to lead to a unionist recovery .
the party was in a mutinous condition in november 1911 and there was no apparent successor who would have even half of balfour 's political gifts .
nor was it clear that balfour 's departure was universally desired : at the national union conference a few days later , leo maxse was booed off the platform , and constituency parties everywhere passed resolutions regretting balfour 's decision .
a great many crocodile tears were shed , for , since unionists had such an elevated view of the principle of leadership , they were unable to accept that they had just driven their own leader from office .
the shock caused by balfour 's going thus did something to steady the party and it certainly produced a real determination to settle the affairs of the party with less friction than had been fashionable of late .
the main contenders for the leadership were austen chamberlain and walter long , representing the two different establishments of the edwardian unionist party â€” the opposite worlds of birmingham and wiltshire â€” but the situation was complicated by the intervention of two outsiders , edward carson and andrew bonar law .
two strong groups emerged behind long and chamberlain , about equal in numbers , but there were few backers for carson or law .
carson thereupon fell out of the contest â€” or rather announced that he was not standing , for no official nominations had been made .
the party officers and whips were solidly behind chamberlain , but law drew off some of his support among tariff reformers and , urged on by edward goulding and max aitken , he refused to withdraw unless his continued candidature would allow long to win .
against chamberlain it was remembered that he was a liberal unionist ( as was lansdowne , who led the unionists in the lords ) and that he had not been entirely loyal to balfour since the referendum pledge .
long was supported by the bulk of the english county members but by few of the party 's men of talent .
by the morning of friday 10 november it was clear that neither chamberlain nor long would secure a majority and that some supporters of each of them would not contentedly follow the other .
a party meeting was to be held on the following monday and the whips were making preparation for a vote to be taken .
chamberlain provided the way out by suggesting to balcarres that both he and long should withdraw and so allow law to be elected unanimously ; he also turned down balcarres 's remarkable advice that he should allow long to be elected since long would make such a mess of things that chamberlain would be bound to succeed within the year .
faced with chamberlain 's proposition , and without a majority of his own , long had no option but to agree .
bonar law , backed by fewer mps than any of the other three contenders at the beginning of the week was now to be the unanimous choice .
robert sanders reported the election meeting on 13 november with evident satisfaction :
the carlton meeting on monday went off quite admirably .
harry chaplin in the chair a very great success .
a good many men came into the room by no means inclined to acquiesce in the proposed arrangement .
walter long proposed bonar law .
his speech was one of the best things i have heard .
manly and rather touching .
the country gentleman at his best .
he spoke and evidently felt strongly of the degradation that it would have been to the parry to have elected a leader by secret ballot .
austen followed .
when austen sat down chaplin suggested that he had better put the question at once and on getting an affirmative shout did so .
a clever way of stifling discussion and few could have done it so well .
motion carried unanimously .
bonar law then sent for â€¦
his speech struck me as the feeblest of the day .
he was evidently moved and nervous .
the meeting separated in great content with the conservative party all round .
it was certainly creditable .
the urgency of the events following balfour 's resignation was due to the need to find a new leader before the national union conference .
so within a few days of his grudging acceptance by his parliamentary colleagues , law 's leadership was ratified by the throng of party notables at leeds ; here he received a reception more typical of what was to come in the future .
in 1911 law was known â€” in so far as he was known at all in the parliamentary party â€” as a spirited debater .
a. ) .
p. taylor has noted that law was trained , if he was trained for anything in his early career , to be a debater .
in glasgow he had picked up many of the skills that a more highly-born politician might have acquired in the oxford union or at the bar , but skills that were very different in appearance .
his concern was solely with effectiveness rather than style ; he rarely spoke with more than brief notes and left it to the occasion to furnish the words .
( when he became chancellor of the exchequer this practice caused consternation at the treasury , when he used only a page of notes to assist him in moving complicated resolutions on wartime finance ; he relied successfully on his memory to provide details and figures . )
as an extempore speaker he was able to tailor his words to his audience 's reactions and so convey the impression of personal conversation even when addressing thousands .
in parliament he was wont to abandon an argument half-completed if he sensed that his point had been made ; the speeches that appear in hansard were touched up by his staff , and his speeches in the country were given to the press in advance .
in debate he was a formidable opponent , and one that asquith was never able to master , for all his forensic skills .
again law succeeded by unorthodoxy ; he was quick to grasp the essentials of an opponent 's argument and quite prepared to be rude or direct if the situation demanded it .
in the long debates over marconi in 1913 and over the curragh mutiny in 1914 law was able to nail asquith 's evasions where a more polished stylist might have been foiled .
occasionally , in the onrush of pursuit , he gave commitments that were later regretted , but these were a small price to pay .
the unionist recovery was built around law 's leadership , but what asquith called the new style of obstruction , threats and offensive behaviour did not originate with law .
the beginnings are to be found in the diehard campaign against the parliament bill .
it was in june 1911 that the first scenes of disorder were mounted in the house of commons , led by lord hugh cecil .
in august 1911 the diehard peers used language as violent as any that law was to use later , and in the crucial decision on the house of lords law sided with the hedgers rather than the ditchers .
ulster 's opposition to home rule long pre-dated law 's leadership and he had rarely even spoken on irish affairs in parliament before becoming leader .
before he succeeded balfour then , law was not associated with any of the features that were to characterize his party leadership ; his contribution was to use the leadership in the service of all of these causes , to make himself the spokesman for the most spirited sections of the party .
law conceived of the role of the leader in an exactly opposite sense from balfour : he sought to foster unity by placing himself at the head of the discordant elements where balfour had thrown the leadership on the side of restraint .
their respective positions explain this in part : as ex-prime minister and a considerable figure in his own right , balfour had the confidence to believe in his own judgement even when isolated from the bulk of the party ; as the tertium quid in the recent contest , law had neither the weight nor the confidence to take such a detached view .
his strategy was rather to canalize the enthusiasm of the diehards into party channels , to articulate their views , and to create unity from the sense of movement .
in his characteristic phrase , i am their leader , i must follow them â€” but he determined to follow them from the front .
as a result of this he was labelled as a diehard and a bigot , when he actually distrusted the diehards and was himself distrusted by the bigots .
much of his leadership was thus a form of pragmatic extremism , extreme action and the threat of more extreme action to come , but used in the cause of more limited objectives .
he certainly held deep convictions as to the absolute wrongness of the liberal policies that he opposed , but at least a part of his apparent hostility was assumed for the occasion , a hard line that might secure a better compromise in the end .
so in his first major speech as leader in parliament he wasted little time on the customary compliments and warned the government that he intended to play hard .
in private conversation he told asquith i am afraid that i shall have to show myself very vicious mr asquith this session .
i hope you will understand .
in later conversations about ulster , law was frank enough to point out that bloodshed in ulster would be the best way of ensuring an electoral landslide for the unionists .
there was then an open toughness about party tactics ; before the buckingham palace conference in 1914 he had central office work out the electoral effects of excluding nine , six or four counties of ulster from an independent ireland the concern of a calculating pragmatist not of a bigot .
from the party viewpoint law 's methods were successful but dangerous ; expectations raised when the party was in full cry were not easily set aside for an eventual compromise , and the only outcome that would fully vindicate the methods was the recovery of power .
the basis of recovery was then law 's fighting capacities as leader .
in parliament there would be a carefully organized campaign of resistance that would at least slow the government down and raise unionist morale .
improved morale would also make possible organizational advances outside parliament , all linked to the issue of ulster , and with the sights fixed firmly on the next election , an election that would make or break the union , the empire and law 's leadership of the party .
all was linked to the sense of a new departure , a new style , a new regime in politics and a new team at the helm : as well as a new leader , the party had by the middle of 1912 a new chief whip , party chairman , party treasurer , principal agent , press adviser , and an almost entirely new team of whips and organizers .
party organization provided the easiest advances because it was the only area entirely under the party 's control .
no general election was fought by the organization set up after 1911 , but there is little doubt that there was a massive improvement ; criticisms that were commonplace in 1910 were not to be heard by 1913 .
the space available to central office was increased by the acquisition of st stephen 's house as well as st stephen 's chambers , which had been occupied since 1874 ; the new office cost $3,000 a year in rent alone .
the quality of the senior staff was improved by the appointment of three specialists .
john boraston took over as principal agent in 1912 , having been a professional organizer all his career and latterly chief agent to the liberal unionist council .
he joined william jenkins , appointed chief organizing agent in 1911 and previously district agent for the midlands liberal unionists .
the party was indeed handed over to birmingham .
finally , malcolm fraser , ex-editor of the standard and of the daily express became first honorary press adviser and subsequently was employed to run the press bureau at the colossal salary of â£1,200 .
steel-maitland , boraston , jenkins and fraser made up a team of experts , all of sufficient status to deal with politicians who might call into the office ; the work of the office was departmentalized for the first time and the heads of department brought together into a supervising board .
the influence of central office toned up the rest of the organization .
a new canvass system was introduced in 1911 so that all county constituencies would operate the same system and so that duplicate records could be kept at area level .
this was important at a time when outvoters were a larger group in many constituencies than the size of the majority and when the outvoters were overwhelmingly unionist .
in 1914 a register of car owners was compiled , also important when some voters could cast several votes in an election when polling went several days .
by november 1912 only fifty-one constituencies in great britain were without candidates , a much better position than the position at dissolution in either 1909 or 1910 ; few of these fifty-one constituencies were winnable , but in any case most of them had candidates by the end of 1913 .
a programme of speakers for a general election was also ready by 1913 , with both constituencies and politicians told in advance what they might expect .
the financial mismanagement that had reigned before 1911 was ended with the employment of professional accountants .
expenditure on central office , district offices and the london office doubled from â£32,466 in 1909â€“10 to $68,957 in 1913â€“14 ; the total expenditure of the party organization from central funds also doubled from $73,000 to over â£150,000 .
to pay for this outpouring , a great drive was mounted for additional income -by farquhar and steel-maitland .
in 1912 ordinary subscriptions still brought in only â£12000 a year and it proved difficult to raise them to anything like what was needed .
the method adopted was to canvass for capital donations that could then be invested to bring in a regular income , and both balfour and law were used to raise the wind .
steel-maitland told balfour that farquhar and i are endeavouring to raise more money .
i think we are likely to succeed â€” thanks in part to the very generous example set by lord rothschild .
but i would b , e very glad if i might see you on your return to ask you to help me in two cases .
systematic collections were made from peers and from the city ; by the outbreak of war the invested funds amounted to $671,000 â€” twice the sum in 1911 and worth four years expenditure â€” and there was a special cash deposit of â£120,000 for the coming election .
in three other areas , as much political as organizational , advances were made towards the management of the press , the coordination of the heterogeneous collection that made up the party , and the fostering of modern attitudes in the local parties .
under malcolm fraser the party began to make effective use of its support in fleet street .
it had been recognized that liberals had been more adept at handling the press because they were more ready to stoop to newspaper practices , as sandars had reported in 1909 :
i told northcliffe that if his people would make enquiries at our central office , he would find that our nightly regiment of speakers was at least as well worth reporting as the radical contingent , but that i realized that from the press point of view , no doubt , our speakers did not play up to the reporters by> handing them their speeches in advance , and by other tricks of the kind to which the radical orators have recourse .
this was the essence of the problem : the press could only be managed by someone who knew their methods and who would not expect them to come round to central office to search for news .
the uoc found that it is patent that some feeling exists among the unionist press that , while in the past they have done much for the party , the party has not assisted in their work .
in many quarters it is asserted that the unionist press are treated with greater courtesy by the radicals than by their own side .
fraser dealt with this problem without difficulty and explained to law in 1913 that the importance of getting important speeches in advance is shown in concrete manner by your wallsend speech on october 29th .
the verbatim reports reached most of the newspapers in places such as aberdeen at one o clock in the morning of the 30th .
he went on to quote the response that had been received from editors :
manchester dispatch : i hope you will continue this form of enterprise .
you fully know as an old pressman the difficulty of dealing with a big speech late at night â€¦
daily express : i am much obliged to you for the precis of mr bonar law 's speech last night .
it was a great help to us .
the speech came over the wires so late and the sheets were so confused by the post office â€” which is usual in these cases â€” that without the precis we could not possibly have got the leader through in time for the first edition .
so in the supply of information to newspapers predisposed to support the party , much was achieved merely by employing a specialist .
the other side of press management , depending on informal contacts , is less easy to assess .
in 1911 steel-maitland invited blumenfeld of the daily express to central office for a two-way exchange of ideas and advice .
he also used law himself to impress editors who were on less familiar terms with fraser , as with marlowe of the daily mail , and law took a direct interest in negotiations with the most difficult of all the unionist editors , j. l. garvin of the observer .
law personally conducted the negotiations with gardner sinclair over the sale of the observer and the pall mall gazette in 1914 ; this negotiation also demonstrates that , as well as producing information and nursing editors , the party had to work hard to keep some of the newspapers in business .
sinclair did buy the observer and the pall mall in the end , but not before he had been given a $45,000 guarantee from party funds .
such investments had a double purpose , for they could bring in income and provide a political bonus .
one such scheme involved the purchase of the daily express by max aitken with party funds , but the party was also propping up the globe , the standard , and a wide range of provincial dailies .
all these transactions were secret , for there would be little use in keeping a paper alive if it were known to be owned by a political party .
the papers were therefore bought through nominees or bank loans backed with party capital .
it was usual to extract some form of guarantee in exchange for party support but the secrecy prevented such undertakings from being enforced .
sinclair thus gave an undertaking that his papers would always remain unionist , but steel-maitland doubted if such a promise had any value .
the later history of the daily express suggests not : when the express became hostile in the 1920s , younger raged when i think of the large sum of money this office has put into that gutter print it makes my blood boil .
the justification for pouring out large sums without a certain return was the even greater cost of any real alternative .
the support for the express in 1912 provides for the introduction of â£50,000 or $60,000 to retain the only half-penny paper the party possesses in london , and no less a sum than $700,000 to â£1 , 000,000 would be necessary to start a similar paper if the daily express were allowed to go .
the struggle therefore went on to keep the unionist press alive , and in 1912 and 1913 both aitken and northcliffe stood by the party and gave valuable support in their papers .
the coordination of competing party bodies was carried out with surprising ease .
the national union was merged with central office in 1911 and fusion with the liberal unionists followed in 1912 .
joseph chamberlain retained his preference for independence but allowed himself to be overruled by austen and by the overwhelming wishes of the liberal unionist council to merge .
to cater for all susceptibilities , the party became the national unionist association of conservative and unionist associations â€” a decision that allowed some local parties to go on calling themselves conservative , but the name liberal was at last dropped .
the liberal unionists were admitted to the carlton club and a longstanding source of tension was eradicated .
this was in itself a striking commentary on what had already been done : liberal unionists who had resisted amalgamation under balfour and acland-hood in 1911 acquiesced meekly under law and steel-maitland in 1912 .
other organizations could not be absorbed but could still be brought within the central office orbit .
so in 1911 steel-maitland offered to join the halsbury club in order to guide it on to safer lines â€” and was immediately accused of disloyalty by walter long .
long helped though by placing both steel-maitland and boraston on the executive committee of the union defence league for the same purpose .
steel-maitland also explained to lord robert cecil that it has been arranged that the national conservative union should send out leaflets produced by several of the ancillary organizations , such as the tariff reform league , the anti-socialist union , the primrose league , the london municipal society etc .
the central office attitude was flexible , for outside bodies would always exist and could even be made use of :
they represent a time when either their objects were not the same as those of the official organization , or the cco was not enterprising enough to suit them .
but some caution should be observed .
it may be wise , while retaining or regaining control , to trade under different names .
in some cases additional subscriptions may be obtained , in others full responsibility may be avoided .
with open allies like the primrose league , the case for collaboration was strong ; for the first time in thirty years of existence the primrose league formally linked itself with the party in 1914 .
on the other hand , the independence of the tariff reform league was a positive advantage : after january 1913 the party supported the tariff policy but was not including them in its immediate programme , so that central office could continue to distribute tariff propaganda from the trl without compromising party policy .
in general , efforts to ensure better coordination were a matter of the patient building up of contacts , although the improved party morale and the greater efficiency of central office had removed their justification for existence .

steady currents
3.1 .
the basic equations
in this chapter we shall be concerned with phenomena in which the main role is played by the current of charged particles .
all our variables can be functions of space but are independent of time .
it is easy to present the relevant equations ; we have all of eqns ( 1.1 ) -(1.7) but have to substitute a/at = o , yielding formula .
there is a difficulty with eqn ( 3.6 ) .
it is correct for most of the chapter with formula taken as a constant but breaks down for ferromagnetic materials , which will be discussed in section 3.11 .
all the other equations are all right but will not necessarily provide the simplest starting point for solving a given problem .
we shall , therefore , introduce a number of alternative formulations .
first , we could search for some analogue of the potential function which proved so useful in electrostatics .
we found there that by choosing a scalar function in the form formula we could automatically satisfy the other equation for the electric field strength , formula .
can we do the same thing for the magnetic quantities ?
no , but we can do a similar thing .
since it is the equation formula that needs to be satisfied , we should choose the potential as a vector ( called , not without logic , the vector potential ) , defined by the equation formula .
substituting the above equation into eqn ( 3.1 ) we get formula , or using the vector relation ( eqn ( a.6 ) ) we obtain the modified form formula .
this equation can be further simplified to formula by choosing ( in the physicist 's jargon this is called choosing the gauge ) formula .
can we do that ?
one ca n't usually assign some arbitrary value to the divergence of a vector function .
in the present case , however , we do have some freedom of choice .
the definition of a by eqn ( 3.8 ) is not unique .
if we add to a the gradient of a scalar function , the resulting vector a' still gives the same magnetic field because formula .
hence a suitable choice of will ensure that formula .
so we are left with eqn ( 3.11 ) .
if the current density is specified , eqn ( 3.11 ) will provide the solution for a from which b can be determined .
how can we find a solution for a ?
there is nothing easier .
we only need to remember the differential equation for the scalar potential formula ( eqn ( 2.12 ) ) and its solution in the form of eqn ( 2.24 ) .
by analogy the general solution of eqn ( 3.11 ) is formula .
a simple integration will yield a if j is given .
we shall go through a number of examples later .
for the moment let us use the above expression for deriving biot-savart 's law .
first we shall assume that the current density is confined to a thin wire in which case the integration variable may be changed to formula , where s is a vector normal to the cross-section , formula is the area of the cross-section , and di is an elementary vector along the tangent of the wire .
noting further that j.s = i and that i must be constant along the wire we may write eqn ( 3.15 ) in the modified form formula , whence the magnetic field strength is formula .
we have to stop here for a moment to sort out the coordinates .
as may be seen in fig. 3.1 the coordinates of the wire element are x' , y' , z' , whereas the coordinates of the point where we wish to determine the magnetic field are set of coordinates .
thus the curl operates on the coordinates of p but not on those of dl leading to formula where ir is the unit vector in the direction r and we have made use of the vector relation ( a3 ) in the appendix .
this is biot-savart 's law derived directly from maxwell 's equations .
are there any other ways of determining the magnetic field ?
well , one can use eqn ( 3.1 ) as it is , but very often one is better off by using its integral form that can be obtained by integrating both sides of eqn ( 3.1 ) over a surface formula .
by using stokes ' theorem for the left-hand-side and recognizing that the integral of the current density gives the current , the above equation reduces to formula , where the line integration is along the curve c enclosing the surface .
the positive sense of the integration path is defined relative to the positive current direction according to the usual right-hand convention .
equation 3.21 ) is known as ampã¨re 's law .
we have now a number of equations describing the same thing .
which equation should we use in a practical case , the equation for the vector potential , ampã¨re 's law , biot-savart 's law , or attack directly maxwell 's equations ?
it 's hard to tell .
experience with practical calculations helps , but even after years of work one usually remains this side of infallibility .
i regret to say that there are no general guidelines available .
if one manages to find the simplest method at the first attempt that can mostly be attributed to good luck .
can we claim then that the vector potential is as useful as its scalar counterpart in electrostatics ?
for computational purposes the answer is an unambiguous no .
it is always laborious to find the components of a vector , so we are not much better off with a than with h or b. it turns out however that a is a more basic quantity of physics than b. since b is given by the curl of a it is possible that a is finite while its curl is zero .
interestingly , under these conditions a has an effect on certain quantum-mechanical phenomena
it would be unfair both to the vector potential and to quantum mechanics to say that none of those formulations have engineering applications ( in fact the most sensitive magnetometer built to date is based on that kind of theory ) , but by and large engineers would n't lose much sleep if the use of a were banned with immediate effect .
the vector potential is not a popular variable among engineers , maybe because it is not directly measurable .
there are no instruments capable to measure the magnitude or direction of a.
in my opinion a is a useful thing if used with moderation .
it helped us to derive biot-savart 's law , it will come handy later in solving certain radiation problems , and it often leads to nice formulae , e.g. for the magnetic flux crossing a surface , defined as formula that may be rewritten in terms of the vector potential as follows : formula where c is the curve enclosing the surface .
we have now collected a good number of formulae which will serve us well in the following sections .
before going on , just a few words about the classification of steady currents .
it may be roughly divided into two parts : magnetostatics and the rest .
we shall discuss the rest first ( sections 3.2â€“3.5 ) , and that will give us some idea of the relative significance of electric and magnetic fields .
sections 3.6â€“3.16 are concerned with magnetostatics , where electric fields are assumed to be zero and the interrelationship of j , h , and b are studied .
since we have so many variables , and since in each physical configuration only some of them appear , we will record ( just for this chapter ) the non-zero variables in each section heading .
3.2 .
the defocusing of an electron beam ( j , e , d , p , h , b )
we have so far talked about positive and negative charges , about point charges , and distributed charge .
i shall now introduce the concept of an elementary charge , 1.6 ã— 10 -19 c , carried by an elementary particle called the electron .
this is not a necessity .
it is possible to study electromagnetic theory without ever mentioning the word electron , but since it has become such a household word and is used so often we can just as well make use of it .
in the present section we shall consider a cylindrical electron beam of radius a in which the charge density is uniform ( p = po ) and all electrons travel with velocity v.
we are not going to enquire into the details how such beams can be produced ( it belongs to the subject of physical electronics ) ; we shall accept the fact that the beam exists and will try to work out the forces on the outermost electrons .
there is now cylindrical symmetry and a net charge per unit length formula , yielding for the radial component of the electric field formula .
the magnetic field may be obtained from ampã¨re 's law ( eqn ( 3.21 ) ) as follows formula , where the line integral is taken over the circle of radius a ( fig. 3.2 ) , i is the total current of the beam and formula is the azimuthal component of the magnetic field in the cylindrical coordinate system specified by formula] .
from eqn ( 3.26 ) we get formula] .
the electric force on an electron of charge e travelling at the edge of the beam ( r = a ) is it is in the radial direction pointing outwards .
the magnetic force is perpendicular both to the direction of motion ( +z axis ) and the direction of magnetic field ( formula] direction ) .
the vectorial product v x b gives an inward force in the radial direction .
hence the net force on the electron is formula] .
noting that formula] and anticipating the relationship formula] to be derived in section 5.7 , we get the following formula for the force formula] , where c is the velocity of light .
it may be seen from the above equation that the magnetic force is negligible in comparison with the electric force unless the velocity of the electron approaches the velocity of light .
thus the conclusion is that , owing to the repulsive forces between the electrons , a cylindrical electron beam is unstable .
using a technical term borrowed from electron optics we could say that the electron beam gets defocused .
the other conclusion ( as far as it is permissible to generalize from a single example ) is more important in principle .
it is concerned with the relative magnitudes of electric and magnetic forces .
since charged particles rarely travel close to the velocity of light we may conclude that the magnetic forces are by orders of magnitude smaller than the electric forces .
why is it then that we have no difficulties in practice in observing magnetic fields ?
the reason is , of course , that there are two kinds of electric charges and their effect usually cancels , so the small magnetic field has a chance of getting observed .
and that brings us to the ext example .
3.3 pinch effect ( j , h , b )
in contrast to our previous example we shall now investigate a cylindrical beam consisting of two kinds of charge carriers : negative electrons and some positive particles , which i do not wish to be more precise about at the moment .
we shall assume that the two kinds of particles have equal densities and move in opposite directions .
as a result there is no net space charge and hence no electric field .
the currents , on the other hand , do not cancel because they represent opposite charges moving in opposite directions ( remember , minus one times minus one is equal to plus one ) .
the magnetic field strength is given again by eqn ( 3.27 ) ; we only need to substitute for the current in + ip where the subscripts n and p refer to negative and positive particles respectively .
hence the magnetic force on the electron at the edge of the beam ( at r = a ) is formula] , and on the positive particle is formula] .
note that the force is inwards , and in the same direction for both particles .
let us distinguish two cases .
both particles are mobile
in that case both of them will move inwards under the effect of magnetic force .
but if the diameter of the beam is reduced , eqns ( 3.33 ) and ( 3.34 ) tell us that the forces are even larger .
what happens then ?
if everything was uniform then the beam diameter would go on decreasing .
in practice however the beam is not uniform and does not possess perfect cylindrical symmetry .
under these conditions the motion of the particles is fairly complicated , and of course our model is unable to predict the detailed behaviour of the particles .
nevertheless a few qualitative conclusions may be drawn without doing any further mathematics .
if the cross-section happens to be smaller at a certain place , then the forces are larger there than at the neighbouring cross-sections , so the beam will be further constricted , etc. , leading to the so-called sausage instability ( fig. 3.3(a) ) .
if the magnetic field happens to be larger at one side than at the other side , then the beam will be deflected towards the weaker field which makes the field even weaker , etc. , leading to the so-called kink instability ( fig. 3.3(b) ) .
the positive particle is immobile
in practice this means that the positive ions are part of the crystal lattice .
there is then no magnetic force on the ions , only on the electrons .
so the electrons want to move inwards but can not because the ions hold them back by virtue of their electrostatic attraction .
naturally , if the ions attract the electrons the converse is true as well , i.e. owing to the magnetic force on the electrons , there is also an inward force upon the ions .
so the whole crystal structure tries to contract or in other words the material is under pressure ( see example 3.2 ) .
in any practical situation this pressure is small and can be neglected when calculating the forces on current-carrying conductors .
3.4 .
flow patterns and ohm 's law ( j , e , d )
up to now we have not enquired into the question of how the current arose .
we just assumed that certain charge carriers moved with certain velocities .
now we shall say that in a class of materials the current density at any point is proportional to the electric field ; in mathematical form formula] , where formula] is the conductivity of the material .
the above equation is spite of its utmost simplicity represents an extremely good guess .
it is valid for nearly all materials up to quite high electric fields .
will there be a magnetic field ?
yes , of course , whenever there is a current there is a magnetic field as well .
but the effect of the magnetic field upon the motion of the electrons is nearly always negligible ( one exception causing the pinch effect is mentioned in the previous section ) .
thus we may safely ignore the magnetic field when determining the lines of current flow .
we are then left with only one equation formula] or formula] or formula] , depending on our preference .
eqn ( 3.38 ) tells us that there is some analogy ( see example 3.3 ) with the electrostatic case treated in chapter 2 .
we may , in fact , reinterpret any of the diagrams of figs ( 2.25 ) -(2.31) by assuming that the whole space is filled with a material of conductivity formula] and the field lines are now the lines of current flow as well .
is the analogy perfect ?
not really , because ( 1 ) as current flows there is some potential drop in the electrode itself , ( 2 ) zero conductivity for part of the space can not be electrostatically modelled since there are no dielectrics with er = 0 , and ( 3 ) when current flows through two materials of different conductivity there is generally a surface charge at the boundary ( see example 3.4 ) .
it is not worth discussing any of these complications because one is rarely called upon to work out lines of current in a conductor .
we shall rather return to a very simple geometrical configuration for deriving ohm 's law .
we shall take a piece of cylindrical material of length l and cross-section s and apply a voltage between the ends .
the electric field is then formula] , the current density formula] , and the current formula] .
from circuit theory formula] , where r is the resistance of the material .
comparing eqns ( 3.41 ) and ( 3.42 ) we get formula] .
since formula] is by definition the resistivity we get the result you learned in school that the electrical resistance is proportional to the resistivity and the length of the sample and inversely proportional to its cross-section .
a more general definition of resistance valid for varying cross-sections may be easily arrived at , but it is hardly worth the trouble .
the essential thing is that the relation formula] is equivalent to ohm 's law .
risking the dismay of circuit engineers some theoreticians do , in fact , refer to eqn ( 3.35 ) as ohm 's law .
prologue
post-impressionism : royal academy of arts , london 1980
he signed the friends ' book in his elegant handwriting : alexander wedderburn , january 22nd , 1980 .
she had said , peremptory as always , that he was to go straight to room iii , where the miraculous stuff was to be found .
early .
so here he was , a distinguished public man , also an artist of a kind , stepping obediently through room i ( french 1880s ) and room ii ( british 1880s and 1890s ) , on a lead grey morning , to the pale grey , classical , quiet place where the bright light shone and sang off pigment so that the phrase , miraculous stuff , seemed merely accurate .
on one long wall hung a row of van goghs , including an arles poets ' garden he had n't seen before , but recognised , from small photographs , from charged descriptions in the painter 's letters .
he sat down and saw a bifurcated path , simmering with gold heat round and under the rising , spreading blue-black-green down-pointing vanes of a great pine , still widening where the frame interrupted its soaring .
two decorous figures advanced , hand-in-hand , under its suspended thickness .
and beyond , green grass and geraniums like splashes of blood .
alexander was not worried about whether frederica would turn up .
she was no longer in the habit of being late : her life had schooled her to temporal accuracy , perhaps to being considerate .
he himself , at sixty-two , felt , not quite accurately , that he was now too old , too settled , to be put out , by her or by anyone else .
he thought with warmth of her certain approach .
there had been a pattern , an only too discernible repetition in the events and relationships of his life into which she had ruggedly refused to fit .
she had been a nuisance , a threat , a torment and was now a friend .
she had suggested that they look at van gogh together , setting up another form of repetition , deliberate , contrived and aesthetic .
his play , the yellow chair , had first been presented in 1957 ; he did not like to think too closely about it , as he did not like to think too closely about any of his past work .
he stared at the serenely impassioned garden made out of a whirl of yellow brushstrokes , a viridian impasto , a dense mass of furiously feathered lines of blue-green , isolated black pot hooks , the painfully clear orange-red spattering .
he had trouble finding an appropriate language for the painter 's obsession with the illuminated material world .
he would have been lying if he had recorded only the more accessible drama of the painter 's electric quarrels with gauguin in the yellow house in arles , the distant necessary brother who supplied paint and love , the severed ear delivered to the whore in the brothel , the asylum fears .
at first he had thought that he could write a plain , exact verse with no figurative language , in which a yellow chair was the thing itself , a yellow chair , as a round gold apple was an apple or a sunflower a sunflower .
sometimes he still saw the brushstrokes , as it were , in this naked way , so that his earlier thoughts of this garden had to be undone , the idea of black wings to be stripped from the painted leafage , the vulgar idea of blood splashes washed off the notation of geraniums .
but it could n't be done .
language was against him , for a start .
metaphor lay coiled in the name sunflower , which not only turned towards but resembled the sun , the source of light .
van gogh 's idea of things had also been against him .
the yellow chair , besides being brushstrokes and pigment , besides being a yellow chair , was one of twelve bought for a company of artists who were to inhabit the yellow house , the white walls of which should blaze with sunflowers as the windows of gothic cathedrals blazed with coloured light .
not only metaphor : cultural motif , immanent religion , a faith and a church .
one thing always linked to another thing .
as the poets ' garden , a decoration for the bedroom of the poet gauguin was more than it seemed .
some time ago i read an article on dante , petrarch , boccaccio and botticelli .
good lord ! it did make an impression on me , reading the letters of those men .
arles , 1888 .
and petrarch lived quite near here in avignon , and i am seeing the same cypresses and oleanders â€¦
there is still a great deal of greece all through the tartarin and daumier part of this queer country , where the good folks have the accent you know ; there is a venus of arles just as there is a venus of lesbos and one still feels the youth of it , in spite of all â€¦
but is n't it true , this garden has a fantastic character which makes you quite able to imagine the poets of the renaissance strolling among these bushes and over the flowery grass ? â€¦
the youth of it , alexander thought .
i thought i was world-weary then .
in july 1890 , two years after writing this , van gogh had shot himself inefficiently in the groin , and had died slowly .
in 1954 alexander , a time-obsessed man , had read the centenary edition ( 1953 ) of the letters .
he had himself been rising thirty-seven and when the yellow chair was put on had passed that age , was older now than van gogh , as he had , in the 1940s , realised that he was older than keats .
he had felt , perhaps , briefly , the power of the survivor .
what nonsense .
the eternal youth of provence .
he thought of thick , fat , hot motorways carving up that land .
he turned his attention to the timeless fields of wheat and olives .
she made a kind of progress up the palladian marble stair .
a painter stopped to kiss her : a journalist waved .
john house , who had organised the exhibition , came almost leaping down the stairs accompanied by a smallish woman in a pine-green tent-like coat .
he also kissed frederica and introduced the woman , fumbling her name , as a colleague and frederica as frederica â€” you must forgive me , i never know what name you re working under , women these days are so protean .
frederica did not attempt to ascertain the fumbled name , having given up interest in stray new people until it was clear that they were of real concern .
she assumed wrongly that john house 's colleague was an art historian .
the colleague looked at frederica with an apparently absent-minded scanning attention .
john house spoke of the history of the gathering of the images , an emptiness here jacob wrestling the angel ) , an unexpected illumination there .
frederica listened attentively ; went on and signed the visitors ' book .
frederica potter , radio 3 critics ' forum .
she negotiated a free catalogue .
she made her leisurely way towards where she had told alexander to be .
an old woman , armed with a sound guide , became quite excited and pulled at the arm of another .
hey â€” look at that â€” winston churchill painted that , the â€¦ â€” carefully â€” cap d'antibes .
frederica dipped round her to stare : claude monet : au cap d'antibes par vent de mistral .
a whirl of blue and rose , for in less formed plungings of water and wind .
to paint , she remembered from proust 's description of fictive elstir , that one does not see what one sees .
to paint light and air between ourselves and objects .
i said , dear , winston churchill â€” the second woman tugged free of the clutching fingers .
not to be mentioned in the same breath with â€¦ she said , looking nervously from frederica to painted signature .
the arrested water shone and danced .
in the catalogue john house quoted monet 's description of the painted light around the snowy haystacks as an enveloping veil .
he also quoted mallarmã© i think â€¦ that there should be only allusion â€¦
to name an object is to suppress three-quarters of the enjoyment of the poem , which is created by the gradual pleasure of apprehending it .
to suggest it , that is the dream .
it was not a view of things with which frederica was entirely in sympathy : she liked naming names .
but she looked briefly down , dazzled by the flowing skin of worked and delicate colour ; the blue and rose tourbillons of the mistral on the sea , the prismatically sliced frosty nimbus round the mysterious squat stacks .
she scribbled words , notes , in the margin of her catalogue .
daniel bought a ticket , and paid for the hire of a catalogue , he was n't sure why .
he had come , he believed , because he needed to discuss certain administrative problems with frederica .
he was aware that she believed he was in need of art .
under his arm he carried a folded newspaper with that day 's headline : peace mother dies .
he was raw to bad news , more raw as he grew older , which was not perhaps quite what he had expected .
he saw and did not see the paintings .
there was a field of poppies and corn which reminded him only of small and large , faded and ghostly versions of van gogh 's harvest which he had seen repeated in endless hospital corridors , waiting rooms , school offices .
he had seen these ample fields , as he had seen cezanne 's geometric brown and green undergrowth in more than one mental hospital day room .
odd , he thought , considering that van gogh himself had died mad and despairing in such surroundings .
not serene , overexcited , these fields .
daniel 's patience with the nervously ill was not what it had been .
although he was fourteen years younger than alexander , daniel too was in the habit of thinking of himself as a survivor , a battered and grizzled survivor .
alexander saw her coming towards him .
a dozen or so schoolgirls were dutifully filling in xeroxed , hand-written , one-word-answerable questionnaires .
alexander , always a connoisseur of garments , realised that frederica had changed her style , that the clothes the young creatures were wearing could be described as a parody of the clothes frederica had worn at their age , and that frederica 's new style was not unrelated to this shift .
there she was in a conventional two-piece suit , fine dark wool , muted geometrical pattern in greens and unexpected straw browns , caught in at the waist â€” still very thin â€” to give the effect of a bustle , the skirt long and straight to the knee .
she had ruffles ( not swashbuckling ) at the neck and the small velvet hat could , but did not , support a veil .
the pale red hair was in a figure of eight chignon in her neck , reminiscent of one of toulouse-lautrec 's fine-drawn cafe habituã©es .
fifties and post-impressionist , thought alexander , connecting .
she came up and kissed him .
he remarked on the parody-young .
she took the point eagerly .
my dear , i know .
pencil skirts and batwing sweaters and spiky stilettos , tottering with their hard little behinds sticking out , and all that red lipstick .
i remember when i thought lipstick had gone forever , a dream of painted excess , as i thought paper taffeta had gone forever , in cambridge , when we all took to glazed cotton .
do you remember ?
of course .
do you remember the eclectic sixties parodies â€” when we went to the national portrait gallery â€” everything , from swamis to major-generals and major-domos too .
these are such a serious and uniform parody .
more and more of the same .
more of me .
lã¨se-majestã© .
and you ?
you have reverted to type ?
oh , i 'm in my element .
i understand the fifties .
i could n't do the forties bit at all , padded shoulders and crãªpy things , ugh , and pageboys â€” i think it must have been purely oedipal , those were my parents ' things , dammit , what i was getting away from .
this is my scene .
so it is .
and now i have money .
in our new austerity , you have money .
in our new austerity , i am old enough to have money .
they saw daniel advancing .
daniel does n't change , said alexander .
sometimes i wish he did , said frederica .
daniel did not change .
he wore the same black clothes â€” baggy corduroys , heavy sweater , working-man 's jacket â€” that he had worn through the sixties and seventies .
like many hirsute men he had thinned a little on top where once his black fur had been extravagant , but he had a plentiful and prickling black beard , and his body was still compact and very heavy .
he looked , in this setting , a little like some painter .
he saluted frederica and alexander with his rolled newspaper and said that it was cold outside .
frederica kissed him too , reflecting that he was dressed like a man who smelled dirty , but in fact did n't .
alexander smelled , still , of old spice and a sort of agreeable toastiness .
his smooth brown hair was as thick as ever but shot now with needles of glittering silver .
we must talk , said daniel .
first you must look at the pictures .
take time off .
i keep trying .
i went to the king 's carol service .
good for you .
frederica glanced shrewdly at him .
now , look at the pictures .
gauguin 's man with the axe .
one for you , said frederica to alexander , still skimming the necessary accompanying print .
androgynous .
john house says .
no , gauguin said .
do you think ?
alexander considered the decorative gold body , itself a repetition of a body on the parthenon frieze .
he saw a blue loincloth , flat breasts , purple sea with coral tracings lying flatly on it .
he was unmoved , though the colours were rich and strange .
he told frederica he preferred his androgynes to be more obscured , more veiled , more suggested , and directed her attention to still-life , fete gloanec 1888 in which various inanimate objects , two ripe pears , a dense bunch of flowers , swam across a bright red table-top rimmed with a black ellipse .
the picture was signed madeleine bernard , and alexander told frederica that gauguin had flirted seriously with that young woman , had characterised her , as was fashionable at the time , as having the desirable , unattainable androgynous perfection , complete sensuality combined with unattainable self-sufficiency .
frederica informed him from the catalogue that the vegetation was supposed to be a jocular portrait by gauguin of madeleine , the pears her breasts , the dense flowers her hair .
you could read it another way , said alexander , interested now , you could read the pears as androgynous in themselves , as partly male .
and the hair as other hair , said frederica loudly , scandalising a few bystanders , amusing a few more .
you like to cork for your images , do n't you , alexander ?
it 's age , said alexander , peaceably , untruthfully .
they were beginning to attract a penumbra of gallery-goers , as though they were offering a guided tour .
they moved on to the olive pickers .
daniel 's mind was elsewhere .
he remembered a straight mass of red-gold hair , in cold king 's chapel , more golden than foxy frederica 's , slowly settling onto a collar as the pins released their grip .
he saw a mass of freckles â€” sometimes melding into sixpenny-sized brown patches of warmth â€” moving over the hard frame of cheekbones and brow .
the sexless voices rose in the cold .
unto us a boy is born .
herod then with wrath was filled .
the voices played with the slaughter of the innocents , treble and descant hunting each other , while she bowed her head , unable to sing in tune .
the olives had been painted from the asylum at st rã©my in 1889 .
as for me , i tell you as a friend , i feel impotent when confronted with such nature , for my northern brains were oppressed by a nightmare in those peaceful spots as i felt one ought to do better things with the foliage .
yet i did not want to leave things alone entirely , without making an effort , but it is restricted to the expression of two things â€” the cypresses â€” the olive trees â€” let others who are better and more powerful than i reveal their symbolic language â€¦
look here , there is another question that comes to mind .
who are the human beings that actually live among the olive , the orange , the lemon orchards ?
frederica and alexander held a discussion of natural supernaturalism .
daniel looked at the pink sky , the twisted trunks , the silvery leaves , the rhythmic earth streaked with yellow ochre , with pink , with pale blue , with red-brown .
olives , frederica agreed with alexander , could not recall the mount of olives , the garden of gethsemane , in the day of van gogh the pastor 's son , the lay preacher .
as the cypresses must always , differently , mean death .
daniel asked , for politeness really , why van gogh had been mad , was it just that he was driven ?
alexander said that it may have been a form of epilepsy , exacerbated by the atmospheric-electric disturbances of the mistral and the heat .
or you could make a freudian explanation .
he felt guilty towards the child who had not survived , for whom he had been named .
he had been born on march 30th 1853 .
his dead brother , vincent van gogh , had been born on march 30th 1852 .
he was in flight from his family , his dead alter ego , his uncertain sense of identity .
he wrote to theo , i hope you are not a van gogh .
essentially i am not a van gogh .
i have always looked upon you as theo daniel said he could not see the pain frederica said was in the olives , and alexander , still lecturing , said that vincent had objected to paintings of symbolic christs in gethsemane by bernard and his compã¨res , had torn up his own , had made do with the olives themselves .
he told daniel about the terrible st rã©my painting of the blasted tree , about noir-rouge , and daniel said that it was odd that these orchards should be all over the walls of other asylums now , to cheer people up .
the trees stood under their haloes of pink and green strokes , small flying things , solidified light movements or saccades of the eye , brushstrokes , pigment .
here is a description of a canvas which is in front of me at the moment .
a view of the park of the asylum where i am staying ; on the right a grey terrace and a side wall of the house .
some deflowered rose bushes , on the left a stretch of the park â€” red-ochre â€” the soil scorched by the sun , covered with fallen pine needles .
this edge of the park is planted with large pine-trees , whose trunks and branches are red-ochre , the foliage green gloomed over by an admixture of black .
these high trees stand out against an evening sky with violet stripes on a yellow ground , which higher up turns into pink , into green .
a wall â€” also red-ochre â€” shuts off the view , and is topped only by a violet and yellow-ochre hill .
now the nearest tree is an enormous trunk , struck by lightning and sawed-off .
but one side branch shoots up very high and lets fall an avalanche of dark green pine needles .
this sombre giant â€” like a defeated proud man â€” contrasts , when considered in the nature of a living creature , with the pale smile of a last rose on the fading bush in front of him â€¦
to emile barnard , st rã©my , december 1889 .
you will realise that this combination of red-ochre , of green gloomed over by grey , the black streaks surrounding the contours , produces something of the sensation of anguish , called noir-rouge from which certain of my companions in misfortune frequently suffer
i am telling you about this â€¦ to remind you that one can try to give an impression of anguish without aiming straight at the historic garden of gethsemane
daniel thought about dead ann maguire who , like anna van gogh , the dutch pastor 's wife , had named a younger , hopeful child for a dead one .
( though in van gogh 's case , the names , theodorus , vincent , vincent , theodorus , appeared and reappeared from generation to generation , the cultural parallels to certain persisting aspects of the family face , a heavy brow , an intense blue eye , a cheek bone , a nostril . )
in the churchyard in his last parish a family in the english 1870s had tried to name a son walter cornelius brittain and had buried three , aged five , aged two , aged one month , interspersed by variegated dead daughters , a jennet , a marian , an eva .
in august 1976 a car , containing an ira gunman , possibly already dead , ploughed onto a pavement and killed three of mrs maguire 's children , joanne , eight , john , two , andrew , six weeks , leaving one son , mark , aged seven .
people had been shocked , by numbers as well as by gratuitous death itself , as people will be , and mrs maguire 's sister and a friend had founded the peace people , whose brave beginning and sad end will not be chronicled here .
ann maguire had borne a second joanne , in new zealand , from where she had returned , unable to bear cultural transplantation .
although the papers referred to her as the peace mother she had not been active in the peace people .
she had brought a case for legal compensation for her dead children 's lives and for her own suffering and one of her few recorded public utterances was to call the first offer of compensation pitiful .
the day of the hearing of her second case she had been found dead .
daniel had pieced the story together from the radio : with throat wounds .
foul play was not suspected , and from conflicting newspapers .
with hedge-cutters .
with a carving knife .
with an electric carving-knife by her side .
her motives , the coroner was to say , were not completely easy to understand .
daniel , who had become a specialist in wild blows of chance , thought he understood some of it .
he had not prayed for ann maguire .
he was not that kind of priest .
he had metaphorically shaken a large fist , impotently , at some looming energy-field , and got on with his work , his work .
he followed the other two into the dark shadows of the room housing the low countries .
nuns ascended and descended a cool grey stair in winged white caps .
the lauriergracht in amsterdam was gloomed and glittering .
mondriaan 's evening was sombre and cloudy .
he liked these .
like vincent , although he was unaware that vincent had remarked on it , he had northern brains and responded biologically and spiritually to tones of black , donkey-brown , varied greys , touches of white in dark .
one of the most beautiful things done by the painters of this country has been the painting of black which nevertheless has light in it , vincent had written from holland .
xavier mellery , the painter of the nuns , was described in the catalogue as creating a light which is the negation of that which envelops our immediate visual experience of things ; it is rather the interior light of your mind â€¦
daniel was used to such language ; it was his daily , or anyway weekly , pabulum .
he knew about the light shining in darkness , and had come , for reasons completely different from alexander 's desire for exactness , specificity , to mistrust figurative language .
he never now made a sermon from a metaphor , nor drew analogies : he preached examples , cases , lessons .
but he liked the black dutch paintings : they were , so to speak , on his wavelength .
he cornered frederica .
you said you 'd news of will .
a postcard , yes .
where this time ?
kenya .
on the way to the ugandan famine , i think .
hippie , said daniel .
helping out , said frederica .
what use â€” comparatively â€” is a chap like that , wi' no training , no medical â€¦ no â€¦ ?
another mouth to feed .
it makes me wild .
i think he is often useful , in his way .
you judge him so he judges me .
judging runs in the family .
it does , said frederica .
once , said daniel , i was in charing cross hospital , someone 's kid had taken an overdose and died , they pump them out there regular as clockwork but this one 's liver could n't take any more .
anyway , there i was , going up this endless corridor , thinking what to do about the mother , who blamed herself â€” wi' reason mind you , she was one of those soft suckering witch-women , but that made it worse , not better â€” and there was th' trolley wi' the dead girl on it , sliding by me â€” sheet right over , porters in those soft theatre boots and floppy plastic bathcaps â€” and when they 'd got past me and were turning i n't door , the first one looked at me from under his plastic frills like , with my own face .
i was shocked for a minute .
got all his hair tucked up in that thing , you see â€” otherwise , he 's not so like me , not strikingly so .
hi , he said .
going about your father 's business , are you ?
so i asked him what he was up to and he said he was going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down in it , and then he pushed th trolley in , and i went in after , and the mother began her howling and shrieking , and will said , well , i 'll walk off and leave you to it .
and i said , where are you going , then ?
and he said , i told you .
to and fro .
that was the last i saw of will .
the nuns ascended the stairs in a perpetual cool silence .
quoting scripture for his own purposes , said daniel .
that was rather funny , i thought , said frederica .
anything on the postcard about coming back ?
any plans ?
no .
sometimes she wished will would not write to her at all , if he would send no messages to daniel .
sometimes she told herself the postcards , or exercise book scrawls , were messages to daniel , but one should never , she considered , ignore surface meanings in favour of implications and the damned things were addressed to her , to frederica .
oh hell , she said .
not to worry , said daniel .
i 'll push off .
i 'll see you .
you have n't seen the pictures .
i 'm not in the mood .
we were going to have coffee in fortnum and mason 's .
no , thank you all the same .

clare still swapped one night a week off with stephanie and reported subsequent events to gilda , who now managed the shoe shop : occasionally she visited clare for an evening meal .
as clare poured sherry , gilda asked , â€˜ so how was the boac pilot ? â€™
â€˜ tony was the worst yet . â€™
clare never felt embarrassed discussing sex with gilda , who could talk about little else .
â€˜ he 'd read all the sex manuals ever printed .
whipped a porn magazine out of his flight case after the first gin and tonic .
he was coldly determined to be a good lover .
for me , that was a total turn-off . â€™
â€˜ porn pictures are a turn-off to most women .
women like words , not pictures , â€™ gilda said as she sipped her drink .
â€˜ but i 'm starting to think that everything 's a turn-off for you , doll .
you clearly ca n't have sex with fellas you ai n't fond of .
i expect you need a chap you know well , someone you feel comfortable with , not these one-nighters . â€™
she swallowed half the glass .
â€˜ now me , i 'm the reverse .
if i do n't give a damn about â€˜ em , i ai n't anxious , and if i ai n't anxious , then i come easy . â€™
she drained her glass .
â€˜ when tony could n't get me to climax , he wanted to ask another girl over , â€™ clare said .
â€˜ he automatically assumed that i was a lesbian . â€™
â€˜ that 's not what he meant , â€™ gilda said .
â€˜ lots of guys find it a turn-on to watch two women making love . â€™
â€˜ how very odd .
can you imagine a woman trying to get two men into bed so she could watch them ? â€™
â€˜ forget this guy , â€™ said gilda .
â€˜ i know what you need , clare : someone you know and trust , someone who wo n't make you feel anxious .
then you 'll relax and it 'll happen â€” then you 'll stop being one of them miserable nymphos who hop from man to man , hoping for mr right , the man who can satisfy her . â€™
as gilda held out her glass to be refilled , she added reflectively , â€˜ although you seem more lonely than horny .
are you looking for sex , or just someone to talk to ?
you ai n't likely to pick up prince charming in a bar . â€™
clare said , â€˜ i 'm not looking for prince charming .
i do n't want the disorder , the pain , the mess , or the misery of being in love .
i just want a short-term relationship , without responsibility . â€™
gilda laughed .
â€˜ so do these fellas you pick up .
but i 'm not convinced that 's right for you .
you need a secure situation with someone you can trust , who you know will stick around because he loves you .
i 'll tell you who you ought to fall in love with , clare . â€™
â€˜ who ? â€™
â€˜ yourself .
you clearly think that you 're a piece of worthless rubbish , and if i pick up those vibes , then so do the blokes .
why not give sex a rest for a bit , and pay a bit of attention to yourself ?
you never want to make a man the centre of your existence .
that place is for you , clare . â€™
â€˜ i am the centre of my existence , â€™ clare sang , as if chanting a psalm , pitching her voice an octave lower , as she pushed josh to her playgroup the next morning .
a man stood on the porch , his hands in the pocket of his beige mackintosh .
â€˜ good morning .
are you a prospective parent ? â€™
clare asked .
she felt in her pocket for the key .
â€˜ no. â€™ said the man .
i 'm an inspector for the local education authority . â€™
after examining the bathroom , the inspector pointed out that legally one toilet was required for every seven kiddies .
clare said , â€˜ but if each child goes there every two and a half hours , one lavatory is adequate .
there is a potty for emergencies .
we have never had a problem . â€™
the inspector was not listening .
he was making notes on other violations .
half an hour after the inspector left , as if to prove his point , the lavatory refused to flush .
the following morning , clare 's playgroup was ordered to close .
two days later , clare 's mind was unexpectedly diverted from her personal problems â€” no job , no man â€” when the cnd office telephoned to ask her for voluntary evening help : they were organizing another protest after a nuclear accident .
over spain , an american b-52 bomber carrying an h-bomb had collided in mid-air with another aircraft .
the h-bomb , with an explosive capacity of more than a million tons of tnt , had fallen into the atlantic ocean off southern spain .
clare felt cheered to be back among like-minded people , doing something worth while .
monday , 14 february 1966
valentine 's day brought two happy events .
the radio reported that the missing h-bomb had been located on the atlantic seabed .
and to clare 's delight , she sold the lease of the apartment in which she ran her playgroup â€” for a profit of twenty-three per cent .
clare felt as if she had won a sweepstake .
on the following morning , she bought a portable tv , a warm winter coat for herself , and new clothes for josh .
she did n't buy any toys for josh because she had decided to open a toy shop .
two weeks later , clare bought the short lease of a small shop in the pimlico road , close to mrs gooden 's home .
though there was a lot to do , clare , busy redecorating the shop and visiting wholesalers to buy stock , still managed to work one evening a week for the movement .
in mid-april , just before her toy shop opened , clare 's weary , amiable , national health doctor looked up from his desk and said , â€˜ about your vaginal symptoms , mrs shapiro .
you 'd better go to st stephen 's for tests : they 're properly equipped to handle this sort of thing . â€™
he seemed uneasy .
â€˜ what sort of thing ? â€¦
not â€¦ cancer ? â€™
â€˜ no , gonorrhoea , â€™ the doctor said apologetically .
clare almost fainted from surprise and anxiety , horror and shame .
then she wept .
the doctor refused to give her more sleeping tablets but scribbled a prescription for tranquillizers , which were increasingly prescribed for women like clare , with symptoms of anxiety in stressful situations such as poverty , divorce , or bereavement ; women with marital problems and women who were out of work also found them helpful , although the pills did nothing to resolve the problem responsible for the initial anxiety .
clare , who blushed with shame whenever she thought about it , waited anxiously for the result of her tests at st stephen 's hospital .
the tests were negative .
but within a month , she could n't get through the day without tranquillizers ; she felt less anxious , calmer .
clare managed to open the red rocking horse by mid-may .
at the opening party , an excited three-and-a-half-year-old josh rode the pretty antique red rocking horse in the shop window .
monday , 15 august 1966
standing by the swimming pool at saracen , miranda beckoned to adam , who was floating on the water in a transparent blow-up plastic armchair .
in a voice of soft persuasion , she said , â€˜ will you do something for me , adam ?
i 'm going to learn to fly .
i want you to break the news gently to gran . â€™
â€˜ but you promised your grandmother not to learn to fly , â€™ adam objected .
â€˜ it was a condition of her gift to you the ten thousand pounds â€™ capital to start kits . â€™
i did n't say for ever .
i 'll pay the money back to her . â€™
miranda was defiant .
â€˜ i 've always wanted to fly .
i wo n't be held by a promise that was unfairly extracted from me before i legally became an adult .
and i get bored with nothing to do on holiday but lie in the sun . â€™
â€˜ when are you starting ? â€™
adam asked , resigned .
â€˜ this morning , at the cannes flying school .
they have english instructors .
four hours of instruction a day for two weeks .
and of course , this time of year , it 's perfect flying weather ! â€™
miranda was triumphant now .
â€˜ i 've already passed the two written exams .
did law and meteorology last easter , and now i 've finished navigation , radiotelephony , and technical â€” that was the toughest . â€™
so that 's why you 're so pale . â€™
three hours later , two thousand feet above the mediterranean , miranda , alert and exultant , sat next to her instructor at the controls of a trainer plane , an ugly little single-engine rallye which her instructor described as efficient and forgiving : you could do something wrong m a rallye without getting immediately punished for it .
flying was even better than she had hoped : better than skiing , better than driving a sports car .
as the rallye droned towards the lighthouse on the tip of cap camerat , miranda felt as if she were breathing the air of the gods .
gently they swooped , turned , and climbed in the azure sky .
after they reached two thousand feet , the instructor showed her how to fly level ; he then encouraged her to experiment with the stick , manoeuvring the plane m every direction .
miranda felt that the aircraft was an extension of her arms and her fingertips , outspread in flight .
heading west on the return flight path , the instructor said , â€˜ this is the first time i 've flown with a pupil and have n't once needed to touch the controls . â€™
miranda pushed home this advantage .
â€˜ then can i land ? â€™
the instructor hesitated , then said , â€˜ why not ? â€™
the girl was clearly a natural flyer .
after being given clearance to land , miranda , following her instructor 's directions , started her approach ; she throttled back to reduce speed and control her descent as she flew towards the threshold â€” the point just before she intended to touch down .
the plane was now moving at not much above stalling speed .
as the rallye dropped to about thirty feet above the runway , miranda throttled back completely and held the stick back .
the plane seemed to glide forward and land itself .
the undemonstrative miranda flung her arms around the instructor .
â€˜ oh , thank you !
thank you !
â€˜ quite a smooth landing , â€™ the instructor said approvingly he hesitated , then warned , â€˜ next time be careful not to land too fast or you 'll run out of runway . â€™
this woman was adventurous and ambitious : such pilots did not live long .
he added , â€˜ careful pilots are the ones that survive .
a good pilot never takes a risk . â€™
â€˜ the opposite of a good businessman , â€™ miranda said , still on a high .
â€˜ a businessman has to take risks constantly â€” and win sixty per cent of the time . â€™
â€˜ in the air , that risk factor would kill you . â€™
nine hundred years earlier , the great hall had been the hub of castle life : wolfhounds ate on floors strewn with rushes ; servants slept on straw pallets thrown on the floor .
then , the winter salon did not smell of lilies and expensive leather but of stale , fat , stinking human bodies and animal ordure .
elinor sometimes thought of all the love and the hatred , the treachery and the killing that this hall had undoubtedly seen , when strong men fought hand-to-hand to the death , to protect their women and children .
now the winter salon at saracen , where elinor waited for adam , was not only the coolest but the most impressive room in the chã¢teau .
high arched walls of pale , honey-coloured stone were hung with bluish-green tapestries ; around the big stone fireplace , where logs burned in winter , stood sofas covered in the blues and greens of the tapestries ; here and there were lamps , flowers , books , and piles of parlour games .
â€˜ what 's keeping adam ? â€™
elinor asked buzz , who was adding up the scrabble score .
â€˜ you said three o'clock .
it 's only two-thirty , â€™ buzz said .
â€˜ ninety-three for you , two hundred and sixty-four for me .
that 's not a bad score for you , nell . â€™
buzz never cheated to let elinor win : she knew that elinor would immediately sense this and feel humiliated .
after an intensive rehabilitation programme of physiotherapy and speech therapy , elinor appeared to have completely recovered from her stroke , although she could no longer think of three things at once , which buzz said was a mercy for the people who had to live with her .
elinor was sometimes at a loss for the right word , or name , and then became impatient with herself ; she was often frustrated because she could n't move as swiftly as she did before .
at times , she was downhearted and wondered whether she would ever write another book .
â€˜ when you want to write , you 'll write , â€™ buzz would tell her then .
now buzz grunted , â€˜ look what i tore out of the daily mail . â€™
she dug into her pocket , unfolded a bit of newspaper , and read , sportsman jim clark today opened a splendidly equipped physical training college at larkwood in wiltshire , formerly the family home of the o'dare family .
lady o'dare commented , â€˜ i wish them well . â€™ â€™
â€˜ i doubt that . â€™
elinor peered at the photograph of the new owner , a motor-racing hero , standing with her sister-in-law , marjorie .
the doorbell sounded .
â€˜ i 'll go , â€™ buzz said .
â€˜ it 's either adam or the postman . â€™
buzz returned reading a postcard .
â€˜ it 's for you , from sonia rushleigh â€¦
whoops , i mean bromley .
who 'd have thought them two would marry ?
she says the colonel 's taken up petit point , and miss hawkins is teaching him .
remember her , the schoolmistress ? â€™
â€˜ i do indeed , â€™ said elinor .
â€˜ frumpy sourpuss !
who 's the letter from ? â€™
â€˜ clare . â€™
buzz held the envelope out to elinor .
elinor shook her head .
â€˜ you open it . â€™
â€˜ it 's marked personal . â€™
â€˜ i do n't want to read it , unless she apologizes . â€™
buzz opened the letter and read it .
she shook her head .
â€˜ it 's just a friendly letter , asking how you are .
but reading between the lines , i think clare needs money . â€™
â€˜ if she took her poor child back to his father and gave her husband a second chance , she would n't need money . â€™
â€˜ how about a bit of generosity ? â€™
buzz said .
â€˜ you 're a silly , stubborn old woman .
and clare 's just as stubborn and just as silly .
it would n't have hurt her to say she was sorry . â€™
elinor looked anxious .
â€˜ do you really think she 's short of money , buzz ?
i would n't want her to have a rough time . â€™
this remark was overheard by adam as , in pale blue shirt and jeans , he sauntered through the door .
he said , â€˜ elinor , you allowed ample provision in the trust for helping clare â€” if the trustees consider that help is needed .
i 'll check on clare when i get back to london . â€™
he put a pile of papers on a side table .
â€˜ there 's rather a lot of paperwork here , things that you should be aware of . â€™
â€˜ we 've had more paperwork , not less , since the trust took over , â€™ buzz said tartly .
â€˜ and i tell you frankly that i ca n't follow it , adam .
i thought the trustees were going to manage the business .
elinor should n't be made to wade though pages of paragraphs with no commas in â€˜ em . â€™
â€˜ of course the trustees manage the business , and they do it very well , â€™ adam said .
â€˜ and there 's no reason for elinor to see any of this if it tires her .
in fact , i 'm about to suggest something that would simplify matters . â€™
â€˜ what 's that ? â€™
buzz asked .
â€˜ i 'd like to substitute paul littlejohn for myself in the power of attorney that i hold on your behalf , elinor .
i 'm trying to reduce the number of business administrators : the fewer there are , the simpler the system and the cheaper it will be . â€™
â€˜ does that mean that paul will be legally responsible for elinor 's affairs instead of you , adam ? â€™
â€˜ yes , but that 's only a technicality .
paul will do as i say .
and i 'd also like you to sign this document , adam added , â€˜ which absolves me and stg from any further responsibility once paul littlejohn has been substituted . â€™
buzz said , â€˜ but surely â€¦ â€™
smoothly adam explained , â€˜ the responsibility must clearly rest m only one area .
it 's in your interests to clarify the situation .
it 's customary . â€™
â€˜ if you think that 's best , adam dear . â€™
elinor frowned slightly at buzz .
adam decided to hold back miranda 's bombshell until later , after elinor drank her evening glass of champagne .
just before five o'clock , when the business session had ended and the afternoon was still hot , quiet , and heavy with languor , buzz left to get some tea .
adam escorted elinor to the elevator ; after taking her to her bedroom , he intended to go to the beach for a swim .
in the high-ceilinged kitchen , surrounded by the smells of mint and basil , buzz whistled â€˜ roses of picardy â€™ with much dramatic warbling as she prepared elinor 's tea .
leaves and yellow blossoms obscured the top of the window , while the bottom was covered by aggressive pink hollyhocks , seemingly determined to fight their way inside .
sylvie , the cook , sat at the big kitchen table by the window , writing a list and shooing pigeons away .
the bane of sylvie 's life was the pigeon droppings that littered the windowsill and had to be cleaned up daily .
with a shudder , sylvie refused a cup of tea .
still whistling , buzz laid the tray .
the soporific calm of the drowsy afternoon was shattered by the bell indicator above the kitchen door .
someone was jabbing the bell â€” non-stop â€” in elinor 's bedroom .
knowing that adam was probably in the elevator on his way to the beach , buzz hurled herself out of the kitchen and ran upstairs .
frantically she tore open the door to elinor 's apartment .
in the passage , she stumbled and almost fell , then flung back the door to the bedroom .
to her relief , elinor was not slumped on the floor ; deathly white , she clung for support to the silver brocade hangings of her bed .
wordlessly , she pointed above the fireplace .
buzz turned her head to the left , where the portrait of the three sisters hung .
at first buzz saw nothing , but then she gasped in horror .
each of the three long , creamy necks had been cut horizontally : a small triangle of canvas hung downward from each slashed throat .

wednesday , 17 august 1966
in the foyer of the clanrickard club , mike grant leaned against the wall at the bottom of a double-sided curving staircase .
with his hands in the pockets of his dinner jacket , he surveyed the room .
it was going to be a good night , in spite of the fact that it was august and a wednesday .
making sure to appear casual , he carefully watched the men in dinner jackets and the women in full-length dã©colletã© dresses move slowly over the red carpet towards the restaurant at the rear , or climb the staircase to the gaming rooms .
mike noticed a group of heavy gamblers , most of them greek , move towards the baccarat room , where the sultan of rupolei had been losing for the last hour .
his attention was also caught by a woman dressed in midnight-blue satin and diamonds ; the sister of a middle-eastern ruler , she was known as an audacious gambler .
he stiffened as he recognized a man move upstairs with a distinctive , boneless saunter : he had better send someone up to check the backgammon room .
the club owners , the casinos , and the multinational bookmakers knew which professional gamblers successfully played games that contained an element of skill â€” such as backgammon and poker- and they preferred to have nothing to do with them ; ideally , the house welcomed inexperienced , rich idiots .
â€˜ this is certainly a good night to play the odds . â€™
mike heard a sarcastic voice from behind him .
he turned and smiled at adam .
â€˜ come into my office for a drink .
what 's up ? â€™
in mike 's office , furnished with heavily varnished victorian club furniture .
adam shook his head curtly at the offer of a chair .
â€˜ i 'm not staying , â€™ he said .
â€˜ i merely wanted to tell you that you 've scared the hell out of everyone at saracen â€” except me .
so kindly curb your theatrical , james bond streak .
i knew immediately what your message meant : â€˜ if you do n't pay up , one slash is all it takes . â€™ â€™
he glared at his brother .
â€˜ i thought you were fond of elinor .
i seem to recall that elinor helped you to buy your first good bike .
why drag her into my problems ?
you might have given her another stroke . â€™
â€˜ i do n't know what the hell you 're talking about , and i ca n't comment until i do . â€™
mike , his face alert and wary , lit a cigarette .
adam briefly described how the triple portrait had been slashed and added , â€˜ d' you really expect me to believe that you had nothing to do with it ?
someone told some cat burglar where to find that picture ! â€™
mike stared at his brother , then slowly said , â€˜ not me .
i agree , it 's clearly a warning to pay , but i swear i know nothing about it .
it could n't have been the brothers â€” they 'd be even less subtle â€¦ â€™
he inhaled deeply .
â€˜ who else do you owe money , adam , you stupid bastard ? â€™
â€˜ no one who 'd do anything so bloody childish !
how do i stop this bloody nonsense ? â€™
â€˜ how many times must i tell you that if you let things go too far , nobody can stop what will undoubtedly happen ?
adam , â€™ mike went on quietly , â€˜ you 've always taken full advantage of anyone who 's fond of you .
you think you can push me around because you 've been doing that since we were in the nursery .
you also grew up watching grandfather 's clients literally get away with murder . â€™
he sucked on his cigarette , furiously threw it into the fireplace , shoved his hands in his pockets , and glared at adam .
â€˜ do you want to be found washed up on the seashore with a few vital bits missing ?
are you so anxious to know what it feels like to have both eyeballs gouged out , one at a time ?
do you want to be slowly battered to death , before dying in agony ? â€™
â€˜ of course not , you bastard , â€™ adam said .
â€˜ i only want to know who slashed that picture if you did n't . â€™
â€˜ whoever they are â€” and only you know that â€” these people are serious .
punters often try to avoid paying .
examples often have to be made .
you know that . â€™
mike started to stride up and down the room .
â€˜ take that fucking urbane look off your face and face reality , adam .
if you lose money , that 's tough .
but if you do n't pay up , that 's insanity . â€™
â€˜ i 've had enough of your melodrama , â€™ adam snarled .
mike glared at his brother again .
â€˜ i 'm not exaggerating .
remember that incident when the sultan 's sister had her rolls stopped , at two in the morning on the grande corniche , after leaving the casino ?
they blew away the chauffeur 's head with a machine gun .
she was n't touched .
she paid all her gambling debts the very next day .
and when the story was carefully leaked to the newspapers , quite a lot of other debts were suddenly settled in full . â€™
â€˜ i 'm not some goddamned sultan 's sister . â€™
â€˜ no , but you also like playing with fire .
you never believe that the gods will really let it burn you .
you think you 're omnipotent â€” but you are n't . â€™
â€˜ keep your voice down , â€™ adam growled .
â€˜ i 'll do what i bloody well like in my own office , â€™ mike said .
â€˜ do n't you understand ?
i 'm on your side , adam .
you 're the only brother i have . â€™
his voice deepened .
â€˜ i 'm probably more worried about this than you are .
if anything happened to you â€¦
i 'd be left without you .
so for god 's sake , pay up , you stupid shit !
do n't think you can get away with it just because you 've always got away with everything , since you set that nursemaid 's apron alight . â€™
â€˜ i thought you were too young to remember that , â€™ adam said uneasily .
he added , â€˜ she should n't have left the matches within reach of a child . â€™
â€˜ she was in hospital for six weeks , and i was the only one who knew it was n't an accident .
i knew you wanted to see how far you could go . â€™
â€˜ let's not argue about something that happened over thirty years ago , â€™ adam said finally .
â€˜ can you raise money to help me fend them off ?
i promise you .
within six months i know i 'll have no more money problems .
never again . â€™
â€˜ you 'll have money problems as long as you gamble , adam .
annabel was determined to get a grip on herself and do as scott advised : remember 1965 as the year she stopped having to go to auditions and 1966 as the year in which she blossomed into a successful young new york hostess as she met andy warhol , lenny bernstein , baby jane holzer , and all the other gossip-columnist fodder .
by july , annabel was a junior friend of the metropolitan museum , a friend of the museum of modern art , and a patron of the bronx zoo .
she also allayed her insecurity with a massive spending spree ; each charity dinner required a new ballgown , and each new glittering friend â€” contacts for scott â€” required a glittering party .
so the year thus far was a busy one .
the long road home
cia hq langley
sorge had never been to langley before .
it was not something a russian expected to do .
it was after 9 a.m. when nowak drove him through the gates , past the guards , and into the vast underground car-park .
â€˜ why langley ? â€™
sorge had asked him on the way out of washington .
â€˜ they want to show you that they trust you . â€™
â€˜ i do n't expect i 'll see much . â€™
nowak laughed .
â€˜ damn right .
we park in the underground car-park , catch a special lift to the fifth floor and walk across the corridor into a special conference room . â€™
â€˜ that 's trust ? â€™
â€˜ that 's trust . â€™
the executive director was already in the meeting room .
â€˜ welcome to langley . â€™
he held his hand out in welcome .
when the introductions were complete , the exec director , the dda , the ddi , sorge and nowak settled themselves round the small conference table .
â€˜ we have a new problem , â€™ kicked off the exec director .
â€˜ the english operative who was guarding trimmler has taken off .
he 's also taken an agent of ours with him .
as hostage .
a woman .
we believe they 're still in new orleans . â€™
â€˜ why ? â€™ asked sorge , concerned .
â€˜ i do n't know yet .
what about goodenache ? â€™
he decided to turn the pressure on the russian .
â€˜ he caught a flight to frankfurt .
he hired a car , but the car was found abandoned on the outskirts of frankfurt .
we are trying to find our missing scientist now . â€™
â€˜ are the german authorities involved ? â€™
â€˜ no .
we have our own means . â€™
sorge saw the exec director look up , his eyebrows raised suddenly .
â€˜ we both have our methods .
even in an independent germany .
after all , it was the death of our people in these situations that has brought us together . â€™
the exec director shrugged .
bastard russians were still upm_to their old tricks .
he ignored the pointed look the ddi was giving him .
â€˜ i thought it best if the director of our operations in new orleans gave you a run down of what has taken place up to now . â€™
he sat back and let the dda give a full report , including the trip to the voodoo ceremony and all that followed .
sorge did n't stir , even when they mentioned the gruesome spectacle of trimmler 's arms folded in the sign of a swastika .
â€˜ we still are n't convinced that trimmler 's death has anything to do with the death of our agents .
there 's no definite link . â€™
â€˜ the situation might be clearer when i 've finished . â€™
sorge looked round the table , saw their undisguised curiosity .
â€˜ in 1942 , in germany , we had a gru network named the rote kapelle â€¦ â€™
â€˜ what 's that ? â€™ asked the exec director .
â€˜ red orchestra .
the nazis called it that because we had radio operators we code-named musicians .
their leader , the chef , we called him , was leopold trepper .
it was this group that radioed the warning of operation blue , the attack on stalingrad that led to hitler 's biggest wartime disaster on the russian front . â€™
â€˜ who was feeding you all this information in germany ? â€™ asked the exec director .
â€˜ high-ranking officials .
both in the military and in the government .
they saw the damage hitler was doing .
they did n't disagree with his aims , only his methods .
when they saw that the war could not be won , even as early as 1941 , some of them opened up lines of communication with us and the british . â€™
â€˜ we did n't get that sort of stuff till late into 1944 , â€™ said the dda .
â€˜ you were n't europeans .
we had centuries of contacts to fall back on .
for all their bravery and resourcefulness , their information was often wasted , because stalin did n't believe them .
but then , he found it difficult to believe anyone .
the germans , with more sophisticated radio-tracking equipment , started to track down the musicians .
even trepper was captured and the rote kapelle was wound up at the end of 1942 .
our information continued for a while , but it was of doubtful origin .
trepper was interrogated by the gestapo and we believed he became a double agent , a lot of misinformation was received in moscow . â€™
sorge leant across and finished his coffee before continuing .
â€˜ but we still needed information .
the overall network with sources inside germany was the rote drei . â€™
â€˜ the red what ? â€™ said the exec director , pleased that he had deciphered the first word of the new code-name .
â€˜ three .
the red three .
based in switzerland and named after the three transmitters that they used .
the most important source of information , from agents inside germany , was from a group under rudolf roessler .
his code-name was lucy and his network , the lucy ring .
roessler , or lucy , was a swiss intelligence officer of german extraction .
he had many contacts in germany .
lucy 's four main contacts were major general oster who was the head of the abwehr ; admiral canaris who was later hanged for his part in the 1944 bomb plot ; carl goehdeler who was leader of the official opposition to hitler ; and colonel boetzel , the commanding officer of intelligence evaluation .
there were others , but lucy never disclosed any of them to us . â€™
â€˜ even after the war ? â€™ asked the ddi .
â€˜ the lucy ring was disbanded in 1943 , after being responsible for some invaluable work .
i wo n't go through all their successes , but it was substantial .
the british were involved with them through us and it was their advanced work on breaking cyphers that enabled the ring to establish such a great record .
but the ring disbanded , once more because of stalin 's penchant for secrecy , after moscow tried to bypass roessler and go direct to his number two . â€™
â€˜ so , where 's the link ? â€™ interrupted the dda , impatient as ever .
â€˜ it 's important you understand the background , â€™ said sorge , not allowing the american to get under his skin .
â€˜ nothing further came from the ring until the last few weeks of the war .
with the allies advancing on the eastern and western fronts , many high-ranking germans were out to save their own necks .
the lucy ring was reactivated , this time without the knowledge of the british . â€™
â€˜ or the americans , â€™ commented the exec director .
â€˜ i suggest you take that up with comrade stalin , â€™ replied sorge drily .
â€˜ it was an impressive list .
they did n't just have knowledge .
they also had wealth .
in all forms .
art , cash , in every form possible .
they used the ring because of their line into switzerland .
they wanted the security of the swiss banks and the russian bear .
one was dependent on the other . â€™
â€˜ so they bought immunity .
while our boys were still getting killed , â€™ snapped the ddi .
â€˜ as were ours , â€™ snapped back sorge .
â€˜ but your hands were n't that clean .
you were bringing scientists and others into america just as we were .
scientists with nazi records , scientists with a history of brutality , war criminals . â€™
â€˜ gentlemen , please , â€™ said nowak , ever the diplomat .
â€˜ can we just stick to what we 're here to discuss ?
go on , dimitri . â€™
sorge was annoyed with himself , irritated that he had allowed the intelligence man to get under his skin .
â€˜ of course , â€™ he smiled back .
â€˜ now â€¦ ah , yes â€¦ we used the lucy ring .
many germans , with their prizes , crossed safely into switzerland .
they came in cars , army lorries , even an aeroplane .
their riches were stored in the banks under private accounts and then they were brought through czechoslovakia and east germany into the soviet union . â€™
â€˜ all of them ? â€™ asked the dda .
â€˜ those who broke their word were hunted down . â€™
â€˜ and disposed of ? â€™
â€˜ some needed reminding that we expected them to honour their word . â€™
it was a cold reminder of their world , of the business they traded in daily .
â€˜ we had a large colony of nazis living in the soviet union .
they were n't all scientists , in fact we had little use for most of them .
they had their own estates and farms to the west of moscow .
they kept their secret identities and paid for it through their swiss bank accounts .
but they remained germans , always dreaming of going back to the fatherland one day . â€™
â€˜ how many nazis did you take to russia after the war ? â€™
â€˜ the narodnyi kommissariat vnutrennikh del , our people 's commissariat for internal affairs , was responsible for â€” â€™
â€˜ i never heard of them , â€™ the dda stopped him .
â€˜ nkvd , â€™ explained the ddi patronizingly .
â€˜ wiped out twenty million russians for stalin .
that right ? â€™ he challenged sorge .
â€˜ more .
thirty million .
according to official sources , â€™ sorge riposted .
â€˜ a most useful organization . â€™
that should shut them up .
he felt the look of disbelief pass between the exec director and the dda .
the other just watched him , the mocking smile still on his lips .
he would be the one rostov had warned him to be wary of .
he decided to wipe the smile off his face .
â€˜ thirty thousand .
that 's how many east germans we deported into the soviet union after the war . â€™
the ddi 's smile disappeared .
â€˜ thirty thousand nazis ?
jesus . â€™
â€˜ yes .
and we kept another hundred and twenty thousand between 1945 and 1954 in hitler 's old concentration camps .
many were nazis , but businessmen and professionals were also our targets .
a third of those died .
the others were eventually released and absorbed into the democratic republic . â€™
â€˜ including nazi sympathizers ? â€™
â€˜ probably . â€™
â€˜ does n't that concern you ? â€™
sorge shrugged .
â€˜ not really .
i was eight years old at the time . â€™
it was n't the answer that the ddi expected and sorge regretted his words .
he was n't here to make jokes .
â€˜ the thirty thousand in the soviet union , as i said , became a community in their own right .
without our knowledge , over the years , with the use of their money and supportive people in the swiss banks , they forged contacts with those left behind in east germany .
they all had one dream .
to see a unified germany .
to regain what they had lost .
they had a code-name amongst themselves .
something that linked them , was a reminder of how they had got there .
it had to be a safe name , innocuous , nothing that would draw attention to the past .
they remembered the lucy network , their gateway out of germany .
they called themselves die lucie geister . â€™
â€˜ the lucy ghosts . â€™
â€˜ yes . â€™
â€˜ did the organization extend to america ? â€™
the exec director was alarmed .
how the hell did they â€¦
â€˜ goodenache .
i guess he was one of them ? â€™ asked the ddi .
â€˜ we were n't sure , but in view of his sudden departure , i would say yes . â€™
â€˜ which ties trimmler in .
and god knows who else .
the name grob mitzer mean anything ? â€™
â€˜ he was one of their leaders .
it was the lucy ghosts who supplied him with the cash that helped him build his empire . â€™
â€˜ why did n't you stop it ?
damn it , you knew about it for long enough , â€™ snapped the exec director .
â€˜ we did n't realize how important it was .
we thought they were like any other wartime group , nothing more than reminiscences and marching songs .
old men remembering their youth .
the importance of it did n't surface until germany was reunified .
and it was only the englishman overhearing the conversation between goodenache and trimmler that finally bridged the gap . â€™
â€˜ so why should the english guy take off with the girl ? â€™
the ddi changed the subject .
â€˜ he 's not one of us .
i suggest you ask your allies about that .
maybe he 's just an adventurer .
no more .
you must have cleared him . â€™
â€˜ of course . â€™
the exec director did n't want his dirty washing wrung out in front of this russian .
â€˜ was there anything else ? â€™
â€˜ only that the gdr , east germany , as it was , is different to the west .
there are still many there who have n't forgotten the war .
their attitude is different to us .
some are still waiting for the war to end .
they 're a traditional people .
many ex-nazis , even gestapo , working and living normal everyday lives . â€™
â€˜ working for the stasi . â€™
the ddi reminded them all of the secret police who had run east germany with an iron fist .
â€˜ some , yes .
others returned to the jobs they had before the war .
within the new germany , many of them have become frightened .
their secrets are no longer safe .
most of all , they fear the israelis . â€™
â€˜ is frick one of these guys ? â€™ asked the dda , remembering the name picked up by adam in new orleans .
â€˜ no , â€™ lied sorge .
his orders were quite specific .
do n't ratify any names .
they did n't want the yanks stumbling in and screwing up in an attempt to force the issue .
â€˜ so what 's all this got to do with the deaths of our agents ? â€™ continued the dda .
â€˜ we 're not sure .
except that a lot of the information we have both lost was about the lucy ghosts .
link that with trimmler 's death , goodenache 's sudden departure for germany and the mention of the lucy ghosts during their conversation , and i think you will agree that is the strongest lead we have to follow . â€™
nobody spoke for a while , then the exec director reopened the discussion .
â€˜ has moscow any suggestions as to how we should proceed ? â€™
â€˜ no , â€™ replied sorge , which was what he 'd been told to say .
â€˜ we hoped you would come up with something . â€™
â€˜ i 'm sure we will . â€™
â€˜ can you tell us the names of some of these lucy ghosts ? â€™ cut in the ddi .
â€˜ the ones in russia .
how high up the ladder did they go ? â€™
sorge enjoyed his reply .
â€˜ in time , yes .
but i can tell you you 're wasting your efforts looking for martin bormann in south america .
he died twenty years ago . â€™
he watched their stunned faces across the room .
well and truly shafted .
they said little after that and sorge was soon being escorted , with nowak , down to the underground garage .
five minutes later they were on their way back to washington .
â€˜ bormann .
fucking bormann .
they had him all the time , â€™ said an astonished ddi .
â€˜ would'ya believe it ?
they probably got hitler stashed away too . â€™
â€˜ well , it 's been a real eye-opener , â€™ said the exec director .
â€˜ but let's not forget we 've still got a crisis on .
find the englishman .
that 's our first priority .
find him and see what the son of a bitch is upm_to . â€™
the amtrak crescent atlanta georgia
the train pulled out of atlanta station at 7.39 p.m. , four minutes behind schedule .
they had slept well , eaten well , slept again and eventually got bored with the passing countryside .
adam had insisted they stay in the room and she had n't found a good enough reason to change his mind .
he was thumbing through usa today for the umpteenth time , looking for something he might have missed , when he heard her giggling .
she was in the swivel chair , reflected in the window with the dark night as a backdrop , her head angled towards him .
â€˜ what 's so funny ? â€™ he asked pleasantly , putting the paper down .
â€˜ you sure know how to give a girl a good time . â€™
â€˜ do n't i ? â€™ he grinned back .
â€˜ according to all the books , a secret agent 's life 's meant to be glamorous .
we 've spent twenty-four hours together and in that time i 've been bitten by bugs in a hooker 's bed , tied up a guy with no legs and stolen his wheelchair , stayed cooped up in a train for twelve hours with an attractive man and behaved like a virgin .
do n't take that the wrong way .
but james bond would 've handled it differently . â€™
â€˜ he was scottish .
i 'm english .
they prefer the ram 'em and bang 'em method .
we 're more sophisticated in our approach . â€™
â€˜ what happens next ? â€™
â€˜ in which department ? â€™
â€˜ in the where're-we-going department . â€™
â€˜ to nordhausen .
that 's where trimmler said he would meet goodenache . â€™
â€˜ trimmler 's dead . â€™
â€˜ and goodenache 's running from the russians .
he ca n't go back there .
from what i heard , germany was still their home .
and nordhausen was where they shared something special .
they wanted to go there .
if goodenache 's frightened , and he wants to hide , that 's as good a place as any . â€™
â€˜ nordhausen .
where is that ? â€™
â€˜ central germany .
south of berlin , near what was the old east-west border .
an industrial town .
it was also where the nazis built most of their rockets , the v1s and v2s , during the second world war .
from what i remember , they moved most of the rocket manufacture down there so that our bombers could n't get to them .
built the factory right in the heart of the mountains .
used slave labour .
i think a lot of people died in the making of those weapons , before they ever got launched and blew up half of london . â€™
â€˜ why would they want to go back there ? â€™
â€˜ who knows .
maybe it was a job they never finished . â€™
â€˜ but they did .
those guys put people into space , put our people on the moon .
that 's enough for most people . â€™
â€˜ that was just their work .
and they did n't do it for germany .
they did it for their conquerors . â€™
â€˜ you telling me that all those scientists spent their time in america and could n't wait to get home ? â€™
â€˜ not all of them .
most of them became good americans .
and good russians , i suppose .
but these two wanted to go home .
they never stopped being germans .
maybe it 's the only thing they ever dreamt about . â€™
â€˜ weird . â€™
â€˜ is it ?
to want to go home ? â€™
â€˜ all they 're after is their youth .
catching up with what they thought they 'd lost . â€™
â€˜ are n't we all ? â€™
she shrugged and looked thoughtful .
â€˜ penny for them , â€™ he said .
â€˜ i was â€¦ uh â€¦ just being a woman . â€™
â€˜ tell me . â€™
â€˜ thinking of peter . â€™
â€˜ ah !
the venerable ex . â€™
â€˜ i know .
here 's us , heading for trouble and god knows what else , and in the middle of you talking about nordhausen , i start thinking of peter .
wondering what the hell he 's upm_to .
the emotional mind of a woman . â€™
â€˜ stop knocking yourself . â€™
â€˜ makes a change .
i usually leave that to you . â€™
he burst out laughing .
â€˜ ok , tough guy .
what 's got you so tickled ? â€™
â€˜ here we are , crammed in a small compartment in a train , hurtling across america being chased by the cia , the fbi and god knows who else , and you 're worried about your ex-husband 's sex life .
christ , he must 've been good . â€™
â€˜ he was a shit . â€™
â€˜ so , why â€¦ ? â€™
adam stopped and shook his head .
â€˜ because some of us like shits .
do n't ask me why . â€™
she laughed with him .
â€˜ he 's cheap , too .
he once bought me a louis vuitton handbag .
your travel case reminded me of it when we left the hotel .
it was for our second anniversary .
i broke the lock and took it back to the shop in la jolla .
they told me it was a fake .
a fucking hong kong fake .
can you believe that ? â€™
â€˜ what did he say ? â€™
â€˜ that he 'd bought it in new york when he was there on a visit .
and if he could remember where the shop was , he 'd go back and sue the bastards .
that 's peter for you .
a cheapskate liar and womanizer .
and i ca n't let him go .
that 's really pathetic news .
is n't it ? â€™
â€˜ no .
just human . â€™
â€˜ very understanding .
what would you know ? â€™
â€˜ maybe not women , but â€¦ my parents .
and my twin brother . â€™
â€˜ you 're a twin ? â€™
â€˜ was .
they all died when i was nine . â€™
â€˜ you said they were out of the country .
that you had guardians . â€™
â€˜ we all have things to hide . â€™
â€˜ was he an identical twin ? â€™
â€˜ yes . â€™
â€˜ that means you came from the same egg .
that right ? â€™
â€˜ something like that . â€™
he , in his usual stoical manner , did n't tell her that he had studiously learnt everything about twins and their relationships .
â€˜ i had a boyfriend in high school .
he was a twin and his brother played on the football team .
if he got hurt , my guy used to suffer , too .
we used to watch the game together and i 'd suddenly see him wince in pain .
just like that .
and i 'd look on the field and it was his brother who 'd been tackled . â€™
â€˜ yes .
something like that . â€™
he laughed .
â€˜ i remember once getting a tap round the head from my dad .
i 'd done something wrong .
i remember him saying it was a shame that he had to punish us both when only one of us was being naughty .
that tap sorted us both out . â€™
â€˜ do you still feel he 's with you ? â€™
â€˜ he is .
â€˜ then you 're lucky .
you 're not alone .
is that so bad ? â€™
â€˜ i do n't know why i 'm alive and he 's dead . â€™
â€˜ what 's his name ? â€™
â€˜ marcus . â€™
â€˜ nice name .
i 'm glad you 've got someone to love .
it 's important .
ours is actually a new house .
it was but er the market was so low that he decided not to well i do n't think he could get a buyer actually , it 's just stood there so he he he let it out rather than have it stood there with the option for us to buy it but i say now the prices are lower he 's not keen on selling it at that price .
and i 'm not prepared to go on paying three thousand a year renting it to give to him when i could be buying one myself .
yeah .
mm .
i mean three thousand a year to rent one 's a lot of money really .
mm .
hallo there
oh hallo yeah , sorry about that
a bath and i was soaking in there for ages .
i was n't quite decent and i thought well i 'm not letting people in when i 'm not decent
oh no .

yeah .
which is not a bad
yeah that is it .
that 's what he said he had to

no .
it 's better than having the water .
they actually took they actually took the front off so that the water would get hotter .
erm and it did n't work and you know
mm .
i thought then i 'd be able to use it as an airing cupboard but it still did n't work but it 's like you said it 's because it 's got such a good
yeah .

mm .
do you hear them at all ?
erm sometimes if he 's been out very very late and i 'm still up and he 's come home after a heavy night drinking .
i mean i 'm not saying he 's alcoholic but he goes out with the lads and he you know he 'll he 'll sort of thud up the stairs .
mm .
but then he 'll apologize the next day .
man after me own heart .
you know i mean other than that , no i mean it it 's not as if
yeah i was gon na say same .
this one .
oh probably , probably .
if he goes to the pub stuart would probably know him anyway .
might do yeah .
more than likely .
no , i mean it it 's not as if you hear the telly or
oh i see , these are his stairs .
that 's the stairway .
that 's his stairs , yeah .
yeah .
yes .
his door 's just there is n't it ?

yes that 's his door there and
yeah .
that 's his stairs out .
but the upstairs one that 's the kitchen 's a bit smaller .
erm and instead of the bath in the bathroom he 's just got a shower up there .
probably is wardrobes there .
i must admit i like a shower but then again i do like the chance to have a bath now and again
bath every , every now and again yeah .
yeah that 's bigger .
erm which is why i went for the downstairs cos i had a choice of either .
but i went for the downstairs one because of the bath .
yeah , yeah .
yeah be nice .
it 's nice .
it 's a nice size .
i mean we 've just been to look at some others and upstairs and downstairs .
but the upstairs one in the other one was was
was bigger than the downstairs .
hell of a lot of difference really , it 's surprising just a
yeah .
i mean i must admit i 've looked at some other flats .
erm and one i looked at i could n't believe it .
erm i mean it was a top floor flat .
and so i mean you had to sort of go up several flights of stairs and you walked in and it , it looked lovely .
thought oh this is nice it erm it it had n't got a separate kitchen , it was sort of like a kitchen diner
yeah .
mm .
but it was very big .

i said nothing !
well he said well it seems funny they 're going out does n't it ?
well i said , well as far as i know , i said nothing , they 're not celebrating anything .
should have said to him , you never take dad out for a curry so kevin 's going .
tt .
oh gordon !
he has taken you out .
yeah , about four years ago ?
you 're very ungrateful !
well he 's taken us out when they 've been to bloody shop working and come back and i admitted that , but i mean just to go out for an evening .
i mean , he never says to me go and have a , do you wan na go for a pint or wan na go for a curry or owt does he ?
no .
well we do n't see him much now do we ?
well , i 'm not , i 'm not bothered about it .
it does n't worry me .
well who wants to go out with a doddery old bugger like me anyway !
surprised kevin wants to , surprised kevin wants to go .
well it 's
could go on to the rugby and go with them could n't he ?
well
eh ?
yeah .
instead of a doddering old bugger like who 's miserable !
well well he has n't got a father so he regards you does n't he ?
if you wan na take it that way .
if if labour say get in
if labour get in and they ca n't fulfil their promises
yes .
like john smith 's made promises then that conservatives have n't done this , that and the other , he must be able to do them now must n't he ?
who must ?
john smith .
well erm , they , they do n't know whether they can do it or not do they ?
no , but he 's criticizing the conservative policies and all that , and what we will do is this .
i know for investment
yes but they all say that
industry
do n't they until they get into power ?
i know .
and and then they all
they do .
back down .
they do .
yeah .
they 'll say they , they probably have n't got the finances to back up what they what they said they would do .
yeah but a a lot of quotes gon na be made to them after are n't there ?
you know , like you said this and you have n't done it , you said that and you have n't done it and all that sort of .
yes but once they 're in power there 's nothing you
well
can do about it .
oh admittedly no .
no .
but they must feel a bit stupid to er
well i ca n't well i mean there 's an awful lot , i mean would , no , no matter which political party it is , they all make promises , but they do n't carry them all out .
no .
course not .
but i mean these are , these are major things .
getting the economy right .
now john smith
but er well john may have
we 'll get the economy right .
now if he does n't get the economy right he 's gon na end up with egg on his face and
of course he is .
but you tell me how just how is he going to do it ?
i mean , ee , they do n't explain to you how they 're going to do it do they ?
no .
they , they just come out er
with statements .
glibly with these , these statements .
mm .
mm .
i 'm sure that if there is an easy way of doing it the conservatives would have found out and done it .
i do n't think there 's any any easy way .
i do n't see how they 're going to do it .
no .
i really do n't .
i mean where are they going , where are they going to get the extra money from er to pay for the old aged pensioners ' er eight pound rise ?
mm .
or so they say , we 'll get eight pound .
somebody 's got to pay for it .
so it 'll be the working people , er , probably the the national er , health stamp 'll have to go , go up .
it 'll be a sorry day if they get in .
it will gordon .
oh !
i do n't know .
you 're a real turncoat you are .
mm .
are n't you ?
mm .
i was listening today to erm a man on the radio and he was only thirty four and he had a stroke and they were saying he , they er , they were asking him , they said well how did it happen ?
they said , did you have any warning ?
and he said no .
none at all he said .
i was gardening and he said er er i bent over to do something and he said i just went dizzy , he said , and i fell over he said and then i realized my right side was paralysed .
and he said i was completely confused and i could n't , he said i was trying to shout my wife and erm and , er , you know my mouth would n't work , he said , but she said fortunately she looked through the window and er found him and they took him to hospital .
and they were saying , they were saying that , you know , you associate strokes with older people , but there 's a hundred young people a week have strokes !
tt .
aye .
and he said erm like it 's the clots to your brains that erm that cause it , you know .
they said , well did you have any warning about it ?
and he said er , no , he said i did n't think i had he said , but now , he said i realized that how i , was forgetting er i 'd be talking and i 'd forget sort of what i was just talking about that split second .
mm .
and now the stroke has affected him that way .
he can be talking , say about a well , you know , about any er , about say a , a video recorder or something like that
mm .
and for a minute he can forget that he 's talking about it .
mm .
you know , but erm he he 's recovered reasonably well in the same , you know , but
got his use
very
back ?
er , partly back .
partly back .
not fully .
you know .
thirty four !
i know !
i mean you just do n't you do n't imagine that do you really ?
no .
it 's terrible !
but a hundred young people a week !
i mean , i , i could n't believe it when they were saying that .
that 's terrible !
it is .
it 's an awful thing .
see i 've never , i 've never across anyone that like know you .
what do you mean ?
well i 've known anyone to be five years and no use whatsoever .
ah well , and i mean aunty lilly was like that gordon .
she never got her use back and she never spoke again .
yeah but she did n't , well she did n't live long after her stroke did she ?
oh she did , you know .
er , not as
mind , she was in bed all the time .
oh she was in bed all the time .
yes .
how long did she live after the stroke ?
only months were n't it ?
oh no !
oh no !
it was n't months gordon .
no .
i mean she was in park hospital for so long and then she was transferred to a nursing home in thornton .
er do do n't you remember us taking iris and ian down to see her ?
i did n't see her did i ?
no we did n't go in , but iris and ian did .
did he ?
yes .
well i , i , we , i , i drove them there .
you was with me .
yeah ?
yes !
well i reckon she lived er a couple of years after the stroke gordon .
i mean , and she was in a terrible , i mean she could n't even speak !
no .
i mean , er erm and i went to see her in park hospital and she was very very frustrated because she could n't speak .
no .
what was she doing in park hospital ?
she took ill at aunty edith 's .
well was it edith 's ?
yeah .
i i think they 'd been on holiday and , she took ill on the holiday and , and came erm , she was stopping at erm , edith 's and er it happened then .
well , you know , i ca n't recall any of this .
yes .
did we , we go to edith 's to see her then did we not ?
no , but i went to park hospital to see her .
because edith now edith was going away for some unknown reason , i do n't know , she must have been going on another holiday anyhow .
no , she was in park hospital a long time .
that was it , because edith was going on another holiday and she was er , she wanted someone to go and visit er lilly , and i said well i 'll go .
and i , i , it was when i had my own car and i drove there .
and i wanted to see her .
she was very , very frustrated cos she could n't speak .
mm !
and she could n't write anything down .
i do n't think you saw her actually .
i do n't think i did .
i never recall seeing her when she was ill .
never .
no .
no .
well you must have been going during the day while i was at work then .
no , it was night time i went , cos i was working .
well why in the bloody hell i did n't go then ?
why did n't i go with you ?
i do n't know .
was it night school or something like that , or what ?
i do n't know .
i think you d' ya know i think you were at night school gordon when i think about it .
i think you were teaching at night school .
it must have been something i was doing .
no !
i know why gordon .
because the the children were small .
one of us had to stay in .
oh yes .
aye , that 's right .
of course , yes .
you know , i mean , they were only small .
aye , that 's right .
did we live in ashton lane then ?
erm no , we were here .
were we ?
yes .
well i did n't have my own car in ashton lane .
no you did n't .
that 's right .
so we was here .
well , about nineteen seventy then , seventy one .
no you got your licence in erm was it , it were early in the year when you passed your test ?
yes i think it was .
well it were seventy one .
mm .
cos did n't you phone me at lillycups to tell me ?
yes i think i did .
yes .
yes .
well i was only at lillycups from august seventy till august seventy one .
yes .
only a year .
and if you phoned me early in the year it must have been just after we got the v w.
yes .
i think it was .
just a couple
so
of months after we got that
i think it was because er cos we 'd got iris ' er er triumph did n't we ?
that 's right .
yes .
soon after that .
yes .
i think we did gordon .
and you were driving that about .
that 's right .
that 's right .
well carl had n't passed
and you went , you went in that triumph did you to the
i did .
yes .
well it 's it was later than seventy one you see .
mm .
and you had that car about two years did n't you ?
oh yes .
perhaps a bit longer .
two years ?
yeah .
because i came , i came to er dellasel
yeah .
when carl passed his er , to m g s.
yeah .
do you remember ?
yeah .
blimey !
do you mean , must be about twenty years ago then ?
yes .
yeah about twenty .
this is why you know , i , i think you should keep i keep diaries from years ago because i know you do n't like nostalgia , and i do n't , but it 's interesting
mm mm .
to look up .
yes .
er , events .
yes .
i mean i 've got no diaries dating back that long .
no , i know .
well i have n't .
i have no record of anything
no .
happening then .
no .
but just one line of things that you know , i do n't mean a diary where you write a page every night , but just two lines you know .
yeah .
all , and what you did and when i got the car , the date and when you got that triumph then .
yeah .
you know , little , just a line .
and then when you look at it er you can recall then
oh yes .
other things .
that 's right .
the one line sort of sets it all off , you can remember .
that 's right .
yeah .
mm .
yes but i remember , i can remember edith phoning me and , and saying , you know she was going away , you know is , you know could i go down ?
and i said yes .
mm .
i , cos i remember coming , coming back , i got lost .
you know where er that circle is where there 's the shops , well instead of taking i know , instead of taking one road i took another and i got completely lost !
mm .
mm .
i would n't now , but then i , i , i did n't know er round that area .
no that 's right really , i mean if you do n't know the area you do n't know which road to take on the islands .
i know .
but i mean , you would n't have thought that er lilly , i mean , she had no weight on her or anything like
no .
that did she ?
no .
she 's always been active all her life .
all , been active all her life .
no , you ca n't understand how these things happen .
well they give you all these bloody tips and papers about what to do , to avoid this and avoid that .
and what to eat and everything but
this bloody footballer , i mean it 's a
i know !
a really fit man .
i know .
he 's , er , one artery was seventy percent blocked , it was in the paper .
yeah .
and the other artery was ninety percent blocked .
was it really ?
yeah !
yeah !
good god !
i mean , he could have gone any time .
graham sounness , i mean he 's only thirty eight !
could have gone any time with with nothing through his bloody arteries !
good god !
but that 's i did n't know it was that bad .
it was in the paper this morning .
and er
goodness me !
well he 's a , he , he did n't smoke .
no .
he was an athlete .
he 's been an athlete .
he obviously ate like everybody else .
mm .
and he
i mean
was n't overweight in any way .
was n't overweight , what more
no .
the bloody hell do you have to do !
that 's incredible that !
see they say it was a it 's hereditary .
well
cos his father had a bypass did n't he ?
oh did he ?
i think some other relative died er
oh .
youngish .
yes .
oh well i bet , i think perhaps it is really .
i know .
it 's still going ?
i know .
yeah , and you ca n't , you ca n't understand it can you really ?
well look at the old lady that walks past here at ninety one !
that 's right , yeah .
yeah .
and she does all her own shopping .
mm .
you know , i mean , she keeps stopping but she 's , she 's remarkable !
she really is .
mm .
but they 're few and far between are n't they ?
when you 're like that .
yeah .
mm .
but what i could n't understand with this this fella that
this sounness ?
aye .
he , he found out cos he went for , to , for a check up and they took his blood pressure .
yes .
and well lots of people go and have blood pressure taken , they find it 's high , and they
yes .
give them tablets .
yes .
go home .
why did they take it a stage further with him ?
he 'd got high blood pressure , he was n't in any pain he 's living a normal life .
similar to what i was when i went .
yes .
and they just give me tablets .
yes .
now why , what made them take it to the stage
well er well , first
where , he wanted a heart bypass ?
first and foremost he was in a private scheme .
well , probably that 's it then .
yeah .
and probably because because of his father and er the the other relative having the bypasses done .
so they took it
mm .
a step further , but i think probably , it 's because he was in er er a private scheme .
very likely in n it ?
yes .
so there 's a lot of people walking about with just taking bloody tablets who probably really should have a bypass .
ah well i , well , i would n't say that really gordon .
i mean i think er , when your blood pressure was found out and you 'd been taking tablets ever , so , i think it 's kept it all under control and you 've , you , we eat a sensible diet .
the only , the only er thing i complained about with you is , is the butter .
mm .
i do n't have that much now .
but i think everything in moderation , but you do n't eat as much butter now as what you used to .
i do n't eat that much bread you see .
no .
so i , i think really , and i think what i think with him , i think definitely i think it must be the private scheme and plus that his own family , it runs in the family .
mm mm .
must be hell of a shock being told
oh god !
it must have been .
see how much it 's costing ?
two hundred and fifty pounds a night !
yeah .
phworgh !
that 's without the operation .
yeah .
well he earned three hundred and fifty thousand a year then .
oh i know .
and plus he 's , he , he , he , he married an heiress you know .
did he ?
er him er , they live in spain now .
oh er he , he 's worth a pretty penny is sounness .
he went in carl 's shop the other , the other week .
did he ?
yes !
mm .
must have been looking for a house .
carl said he , he looked er well er , his face did , it were very he 's got a very poxy skin .
has he ?
you mm .
yes .
he was having it done this afternoon were n't he ?
yeah .
some time today .
aye .
i tell you what , that 's quick int it though gordon ?
with only going in last night and
mm .
having it done today .
it is indeed .
i wonder how quick they would have got him in though if he would n't have been in a private scheme .
he could wait six months could n't he ?
well he could have been dead by then .
well er , yeah , exactly that 's what they 're moaning about int it ?
terrible !
put them on a list and wait .
i 've never heard so much talk about health as we do nowadays .
oh i know .
when i was young i i do n't remember talking all the time about bloody health and what you should do and what you should n't do .
no i know .
did you ?
no .
but we were n't educated in , in , in health though .
we just we just lived and that was the end of it .
yes but then you see , in the in the old days gordon , i mean , you you were very fortunate if you got three meals a day and and whatever you got you were glad of and used to eat it all .
now we 're much more affluent and people are educated er
mm .
as regards their health .
mhm .
well having said that gordon , your mother lived to a good old age , and my mum , and my father did .
yeah .
and they ate all the wrong stuff did n't they ?
according to according to what they say now they did .
mm .
i know .
do n't know who to believe really .
when you look at , when you look at the some , all these , a lot of these composers and artists who died long ago and you look the birth range there 's a hell of a lot at seventy five , seventy six
yes .
oh there 's a few at forty odd .
mm .
but there 's a hell of a lot well into their seventies .
you know , and they were born early eighteen hundreds .
yes .
yes .
yeah .
i know .
i know we 're living longer now generally but i wonder how much
i do n't know i
i wonder
you know
how much , how much , i do n't really know .
cos there 's more people now than there was in those days .
yeah , there 's a lot more people .
it 's not anyhow , i mean , it 's alright living longer if you , if you , if you 've got all your faculties .
mm .
and you 've got good health and everything .
it 's no use living like a cabbage , i do n't think so anyhow .
no , that 's
and when i see these people in nursing homes all sat round a wall in chairs oh god !
i 'd hate to end up like that .
somebody 's .
pardon ?
left the gate open .
did you ?
i wonder who 's that ?
i 'll check .
has a leaflet come through .
yes .
i bet there has .
tell you what , the conservative candidate 's not been round has he ?
no he dare n't .
that , i ordered that one .
mm .
that one ?
well , but it 's only er er record book .

yeah .
five bottoms .
well that 's
well that
half a case .
and i sold four of those as well like .
yeah .
they carry out .
and i sold three three double gin three , you know .
yeah but you always sell a few to take out do n't
well that 's why they brought it .
most probably take out and sell them what 's
yeah .
left at the end of the night .
i mean , not all our customers are absolutely stupid .
buy a bottle at five to two and leave it at two o'clock .
it 's the nice ones that leave their drink there .
mm !
i 'm amazed they have n't
well anyway i was talking to er rosette tonight cos i went to the office for some change and i , then i had this like .
she said , i hear the empire , or , or hear the garden 's doing well on a friday night .
must have heard about that from alan .
he goes it 's too fucking dead !
well it 's it , last day of week
where ?
popping up to christies and just after you go up the top .
no , no , no , where ?
where are you talking about ?
the empire ?
but apparently they 're doing quite well on a wednesday with the students .
students , yeah i know .
and erm mark was in last week he said
they 're getting six hundred like .
well , mark said it was , mark er guessed about four hundred .
he 's , he , he went in last week , he went in this week and er
well paul , paul said to me six hundred , about seven hundred
yeah .
normally he said , he said well there would be about six hundred .
nigel mentioned , he told me it was erm er like four , five hundred in tt to
not bad though is it ?
well it 's very good in n it ?
i mean , on a wednesday .
and it 's only a quid to get in and it 's a pound , pound a pint .
two quid and , and a drink , yeah .
but on the other hand they 're making a little bit at a pound a pint .
well they 're making five or six hundred , they 're bound
to be getting on with it .
that 's right .
that 's getting in the
i do n't think they 've got a lot of staff on .
i would n't have thought they 'd bother with a
no .
student night , having a lot of staff on , it 's pointless having ah , i mean , the bouncers in that situation .
well you 'd only need one .
but we do n't need a bouncer on
except , mind you , the , the rough , the erm rugby club gave the band a bit of er , a rough seeing to .
what band ?
he had some band that were awful apparently and the
whole of the rugby team were lying in front of stage with their
they , they 've never left , they were playing the rugby club ?
fingers up .
no , no , no , no , no .
no !
university
university rugby club .
oh !
the uni 's ?
yeah .
mhm .
yeah .
the band went ran off in tears apparently .
could n't cope .
seeing the university rugby club i would , i would have eh !
mm .
must be some narky bastards in the rugby club !
oh !
i ca n't get it out it 's stuck on his collar i hope she comes back for it next week .
but six hundred on a wednesday night that 's pretty good .
mm .
does the sugar house get that many people in ?
no .
no .
the sugar house only opens er thursday , friday , saturday .
or , or , we always have done .
i mean , we we opened originally , first year , every night of the bloody week and it was pointless , absolutely pointless .
is that bigger than the empire ?
i 've never been in it ?
yeah .
no !
er yeah .
yes it is .
is it ?
it 's legal , it 's legal
well it 's on , it 's on a thursday , yeah .
it 's it 's legally bigger than the empire but the empire can get more people in cos he 's got upstairs and
yeah .
that
mm .
see .
but , of course , erm for licensing they do n't take that particularly into consideration up there .
well they half upstairs straight away .
yeah .
yeah .
so er
i mean , i think , i , i think the empire legally is well i thought it was nine hundred
seven fifty i think .
i ca n't think er i do n't know .
i think it 's nine hundred .
i mean you could you could
well i thought it was seven fifty .
certainly get seventeen , eighteen hundred in there .
well yeah .
even that bob monkhouse opened up quite
yeah .
quite nice .
yeah .
well , they 'll have the garden wo n't they ?
oh yeah .
mind you
probably , fucking tell by , cos there was i thought
they
there was too many .
yeah .
but i mean they were banging they were banging fifteen hundred in for that disco for the first
mm .
few months were n't they ?
no , twelve , twelve or thirteen .
they never had fifteen .
did n't they ?
i mean the sugar house , his capacity 's
just been upped to eleven hundred i think .
erm i mean , it was always nine hundred , but it 's been upped to eleven hundred last year i think .
well we used to put , i mean , i put twelve , thirteen hundred in the sugar house .
but but you it 's full at that , you know .
mm .
whereas the , the , the , you , you could you could , you could fit sixteen , seventeen hundred .
no , i reckon , there was , they reckon between a , a thousand and eleven hundred for a night , you know .
but you could n't fucking move at that .
yeah , but it was a , it was also a it was a bit of a celebrity , i mean it was people , people were crushed around , bloody hell i mean
yeah , that 's right .
, yeah .
all the downstairs , i mean all the plebs were upstairs all the downstairs was erm
yeah but , maybe , maybe a hundred people .
mm .
i 'm sure .
i mean , i do n't know i , you see i left i had to come here so i left before bob monkhouse and everything , i just , i , all i did was go for couple of free drinks and plate of free food , which , i do n't think i got .
and left .
you get a few fucking with the chef .
you know deep sea diving at
yes you would .
you , you betrayed us then , you 'd left had n't you ?
you 'd left me !
i had to leave .
you 'd fled us !
and gone to work for the opposition .
were you well i did n't reckon you were opposition .
but i did go out or something .
just cos you thought you were
it 's funny though
just cos you , you were coming out with about two hundred and fifty quid a week for working seven nights a week !
no , i , originally , they they were open seven nights a week .
i know .
no .
was it four times a week ?
and you were secured were n't you secured there ?
mm .
oh !
seven nights a week , two hundred and fifty in my pocket guaranteed .
going to bed with jean fucking , fucking shite !
kelly 's !
christ !
some of the schemes they come up with .
get your blood going .
i mean , i 'll , i 'll , i 'll be interesting to see how they they start next week with a a load of er bands on thursday nights .
mm .
i mean , they 're all chartsey stuff but
mm .
you know , i , i that kind of stuff does n't draw punters generally , chart stuff cos the people who go
i du n no , i think the young
the people who are interested
i think the young people go to it like .
well yeah , maybe .
maybe some of that will .
yeah .
but generally pop , poppy type
a lot , a lot of
top of the pops stuff does n't , in the sense that people who like to go and see live music do n't people who like that kind of music prefer the prefer it in a
yeah .
disco context .
yeah .
yeah .
not , not , seeing sort of a live concert .
anyway
in fact , in fact most of the stuff they do n't like anyway .
mm .
true .
well they 're not all those appearances are p a , it 's all gon na be mimed and backing tapes .
erm that blooming labour party cancelling that conference on march twenty second and which has
oh yeah .
messed me up !
cos i was mary wanted to go and see simply red at g mex , and last weekend we or weekend before last when they were on , their big , er we could n't because i had the kids friday night and the two of them saturday night and it , that was the two nights .
were you gon na go with her ?
yeah .
so , so so i said well we 'll go to the n e c or she said oh i 'm not traipsing all that way , you know , just for the concert .
so and she was , she was moaning away like sort of oh alright !
i 'll take you over to paris and we 'll watch them in paris on the twenty so she said , oh when ?
so i said , twentieth of march .
she said oh !
tt .
oh !
ah !
the labour party conference is on so i ca n't go .
so i said
oh dear me !
yeah .
and then she came in , oh , labour party conference is cancelled !
oh bugger !
mm .
you see jean on the telly with neil kinnock ?
no .
no , i 've been told about it .
when ?
ee , er , friday .
it 's on all the national news .
it was n't , it was n't on the regional news it was peculiar !
well we did
it was on the six o'clock well it was on all day , one o'clock , two o'clock , three o'clock
yeah the
four o'clock , six o'clock
normal news .
nine o'clock yeah .
it was n't on the regional news .
where were they ?
salford keys .
he was up seeing all the north west candidates parliamentary candidates .
jean was in that horrible mustard and black striped
contraption !
stuck out like a sore
so that everybody noticed !
yeah .
her dressing up outfit .
hear labour are one point five i heard it yesterday
yeah .
all the
i thought she was going to be meeting him next weekend then ?
all the dirty tricks start now though .
at the regional conference at blackpool .
erm
i do n't , i do n't , i do n't whether he 's going to that .
forgotten what it 's called .
yeah , it 's i know it 's north
yeah .
west , er no , regional councils labour council , the urban councils or something like that .
something like that , yeah .
no , well i do n't know , he might be .
i do n't know whether he 's going to that , he might be but this was , this , he was up sort of seeing , meeting all the labour party candidates for the north west .
well if i had a million invested , have it all invested .
yep !
yep !
i agree .
seriously , i 'd fucking have it out of there , everything i own .
but he all the dirty tricks are starting now .
kinnock 's a funny he really is .
he 's er the sunday times tomorrow
er , i remember you said about
full sunday times tomorrow , major expose on the the the labour leaderships ties with a moscow moscow company .
did you see it ?
yeah .
oh you mean , they 're still getting moscow 's
yeah .
it 's like , what 's it they 've got ?
i think it 's about time i got my share of the
well who 's doing it , tomorrow , what they call it ?
report he 's doing tomorrow ?
oh
er sunday times .
personal view of the files on .
typically .
dennis healey , fuck !
he 's gon na out with some stick !
kinnock was saying to erm the candidates , you know , we i realize that a lot of you are getting it rough at the moment , cos there 's about five labour
yeah .
candidates all been arrested in the north
yeah .
west mysteriously .
but er jean not a .
yeah .
derek , there 's somebody derek
derby
derby , that 's right .
blackpool 's under investigation .
anyway , so erm he said , but you know he was saying to them that er , it 's not just at the bottom end , he said , in our village in wales we 've got the sun have now positioned two reporters who have lived in the village the these they sit in a car outside his house day and night
photographing who comes in .
they 've been to his little boy 's primary school , interviewed the teachers and headmistress and all the school friends and everything just trying to get a dirty story .
the two companies concerned are trying to record the spoken word .
we do n't want you on tape .
so the thing , the thing to do is to sort of dot around in the conversation things like antidisestablishmentarianism .
and hopefully
this will get modern usage of words .
of , one of the words that she was talking about , people have started using wicked for a normal phrase .
i mean , it does n't mean what it says in the dictionary any more .
that 's a really wicked thing to say , he went , no it 's not it 's bad , it 's not wicked .
he thinks of wicked as being good , he does n't , cause mandy says wicked .
yeah .
well that 's the idea anyway .
he goes round saying wicked , it 's his favourite word .
are you going to go to sleep , eh ?
please that does n't mean much , does it ?
she 's just looking over there to see which one she wants to throw up on .
who do you want to go and gurgle at ?
eh ?
oh not uncle brian , no no no .
no ?
have you had enough grub for a little while ?
there you are , go and see somebody .

come on , give auntie pauline a nice smile .
go on , you do lovely smiles .
if she smiles it will be at your hairline .
pardon ?
she wo n't be able to see that far , will she ?
she might be able to see a blurred shape .
she 's just looked this way now .
she kept looking over there .
do n't know what she was looking at .
what were you looking at ?
well she definitely looks at her mobile .
yeah ?
i know it drives you mad , the music but er
i would n't mind if those blasted slightly longer life in terms of the music they played .
but unfortunately , you know , it 's or whatever .
but it 's over again .
well , yes .
well i mean that 's what 's nice for them , is n't it ?
yeah .
you see they 've got a short concentration .
do you think music in the background sort of , do all the lyrics as well .
oh of course oh well done .

let's get some peas , i think that 's it then .
right , o k , now we can go , now we can go home .
four add four and then
four add four equals eight .
two times four equals eight , right ?
yeah , like that .
and then two
and two times four is eight .
erm i did n't write it like that then .
right .
share the total of fives
yeah , i done , yeah i done
er
five , five , five is fifteen .
five add five add five
erm is fifteen .
and then erm .
right .
is fifteen .
and then
and sixes
sixes six

add six add six
add six
add six
is thirty six .
right .
six times six is thirty
i 've done that one .
sixes .
that 's it .
okay ?
erm this .
i 'll leave that out .
leave that out .
add them up .
mm .
that much closer can use those pictures .
take a look .
are they near the box ?
yeah .
is that right ?
four
four is twenty !
so it 's four so
four times five is
twenty !
four times five equal twenty .
er two times six equals twelve .
er four times three equal twelve .
er , two additions left .
alright .
those two add ?
so it 's like one , two , one , two and one there and but put like erm seven add seven add seven is .
is twenty one .
yeah .
seven add seven add seven is twenty one
one .
and three times seven
right .
is twenty one and do it that way , five and fives .
okay ?
two addition questions .
hang on .
two yeah but you 've got right two multiple and two addition equations .
not equations !
you told us this !
but , like these , these are equations .
so two addition equations er three times seven plus seven plus seven is twenty one .
right ?
oh !
so , but you can also go
yeah .
yeah add three .
three plus three plus three plus three plus three plus three is twenty one .
do it that way on .
do you follow
yeah .
me ?
yes i do .
right .
two multiplication
yeah .
and two addition .
two addition .
right .
so you , like , you .
yes , that 's right .
then , it 's like erm
one .
seven times three , and three times seven .
and three times seven .
that 's right .
and you do the same there .
same on the adds .
and then , this we do like
right , she wants currency in two divisions in each , right ?
so it 's one , two , three , four ,
that multiplication is a
yeah well divisions , okay , so it 's twenty one shared by say , if that 's one , two , three , four , five , six int it ?
oh i know what i 've got !
six times three is eighteen or three times six is eighteen .
i know what i 've done .
i 've put the , i thought it was er okay .
six .
and division is shared by .
so you got to do eighteen shared by six is three and eighteen
have you got
shared by three is six .
so like , you go one , two , three , four , five , six six times you swap
three .
six times three
times three is eighteen
is three times six .
six .
yeah , and and you got
six times three and three times six .
and division is eighteen shared by three is six , and eighteen shared by six is three !
yeah ?
got it ?
i can not read .
three sixes are eighteen !
you got it ?
and you do the same there ?
hang on !
i have n't finished thirty three
one yet .
that 's what i do n't get .
why do multiplication equation for this similar line i do n't get how you do that ?
is it , would you like us to put
it 's fours int it ?
it 's fours
no two , four , six , eight , ten , twelve
yeah .
it
that 's twos .
no , but it 's going to fours look .
it 's going to fours .
alright .
going into fours .
what would i put ?
er one four is four , two fours are eight , and three fours is twelve .
as this is been shared by lines int it ?
yeah and it 's on that one .
you do it like that do you ?
yeah , cos it 's being shared by
oh !
so it 's , i would say that is er nine times four equals thirty six .
and on that one is er , sixty three shared by nine six time sixty three divided by nine
four .
no !
sixty three divided by nine is six !
write six through it .
ten six in n it ?
no , it 's ten sixes .
no , no wait a minute .
nines .
what should nine times ten emma ?
one nine is nine , two nines are eighteen , three nines are
twenty seven .
four nines are thirty six , five nines are forty five , six nines fifty four , seven nine are sixty three .
oh thank you .
right .
yeah , seven nines are sixty three .
hang on a minute !
six nines are
seven nines are sixty three .
hang on a minute !
seven
seven nines are sixty three !
sixty three .
yeah .
you work them out like that look .
yeah .
well seven nines , well ee er , it takes you so long
look one , one nine is nine
yeah .
two nines are eighteen .
so that one there is sixes into thirty six .
i know !
but i still do n't get what you have to write !
well multiplication equation for this number line i would say is er i 've already told you that .
no , but i do n't know what i have to , i have to write !
eight times four equals thirty six .
do n't get it .
because it 's one , two , three , four , five , six , seven eight , no sorry , nine times four is thirty six .
nine times four equals thirty six .
like this look !
write it out on a piece of paper and you 'll and i 'll write them down .
no !
you do it yourself !
i 've told you what to do .
you do it like that .
i do n't get it though !
i 'll tell you if it 's right .
i 'm just writing the answers out for you !
i told you what to do .
that 's lazy !
int it ?
you crafty cow !

cos we would n't have wanted grandma to miss her train would we ?
if we did ?
no , bus .

the one which is pointed erm straight ahead .
mm .

the daffodils over there in that little bed seem to be a bit later than all the others , i do n't know .
have some marmalade .

i 'm doing it a funny way this time .
i 'd of thought they would have got just as much sun and rain as everything else .
that 's a little one .
mum .
look what i 've done .
marmite .
mm .
very posh .
candles .
do you usually do that ?

daddy has n't seen the new rosie and jim .
true .
lot of things daddy has n't seen .
i know .
inspector morse .
i know .
few weeks before we have time
have you got lots of spare tapes ?
no .
. we 'll have to have another one next wednesday .
are they on every week or are they once a fortnight ?
i 'm not sure actually .
and you have n't seen the the puppet show .
i have n't seen one about a puppet show .
is that where
mm .
rosie and jim mm
rosie and jim went to a puppet show did they ?
they go to stratford .
yeah and a lion .
stratford ?
do they ?
and there 's a lion is there ?
and a and a lion .
he took an omelette .
omelette .
an omelette ?
it was quite good actually .
and a man came back and .
oh .
and went back .
pardon ?
skinlid .
the skin ?
well he 's called skinlid .
is he ?
i do n't know .
i did n't watch it that closely .
have some more tea .
ate it all up .
mhm .
so if it 's a puppet show did rosie and jim do some puppeting ? puppet .
no .
they were in the audience shouting and cheering from what i saw .
where they ?
mhm .
then they went round the back though did n't they ?
did they ?
mm .
they run round the back and played with the puppets .
when the show was ended
nobody mentioned that they were puppets themselves .
that 's what i call a miracle .
i do that .
i do n't think they like it .
mm .
it was nice to see stratford .
i wonder if that they filmed that at the time when the boat was in stratford .
do you remember when we went to
yeah .
yeah .
we nearly went to see it but we missed .
yeah .
cos it had moved by the time we got there .
so it might be then they might have taped it ?
mm .
it could well have been .
but mum it 's a bit late from that .
well it 's always takes a long time .
they they do these things months beforehand .
and then it comes on the television later on .
how to get to know about these things .
mm .
this chap we were sitting next to involved in all these canal projects .
oh yes , that 's right .
he was .
apparently he 's a director of various canal preservation bodies and things .
oh .
he was certainly into canals in a big way .
yeah .
yeah he is .
mm .
you 'll have to get to know is he in your ?
no , he 's at solihull .
oh solihull .
what was he called ?
jonathan .
jonathan .
he was a pleasant chap i thought .
oh yes .
as these chaps go .
it was interesting discussing various chaps after
oh right .
only just sort of see them occasionally to get the inside stories to .
have drunk .
mm .
how 's julia ?
she was okay this week .
well , she 's a totally snowed under
well , it 's not
with work .
surprising .
like i had to give her some top priorities yesterday as she was n't going to be about .
actually she did very well on one of those .
she did far better
did you tell her ?
oh yes .
yes .
well i made sure my boss told her , that 's .
cos he was desperate for cos he needed an answer for monday morning for dave .
it 's going to be thinking about science .
dave 's erm wife produced a baby last week
oh .
so he 's having a week off you know to change nappies or whatever .
it might be or it might not .
mum , is the video on ?
i just , i only pressed hold nothing else .
well you 're not to
well since someone else switched it off i should think .
why ?
i 'm not quite sure what happens you see .
that 's why
i just pressed but cos there 's a little line .
hear the sound of the video .
when ?
well i can hear it now .
oh .
yeah i 'm wondering whether it 's playing to itself , with the television off .
do you think that 's likely ?
or does it not do it ?
no , cos it 's not got the aerial it would do .
it would do .
would it ?
oh dear .
it 's not got the aerial in .
no .
should n't
it is it 's on it 's on the video .
it 's just that i can actually hear it .
i can actually hear the motor on
oh .
on turning round
it 's on the video .
i presume what happens when it 's not on it 's all geared up ready to
mummy .
daddy .
it 's on the video .
what 's on the video ?
telly .
yeah .
yeah when er all which is on now is the blue button .
right .
it 's the blue

ah but that was n't on before was it ?
cos mummy only just come down for breakfast .
no , just remembered and rushed off and to get it .
but it 's true , it does make a noise .
there 's lots of noises , lots of electrical things .
see me .
the fridge made some really weird noises yesterday .
i thought oh what 's going on .
can you see me now .
can i see you ?
oh was it vibrating ?
there 's a little bit more just there .
yeah .
it does .
it a load or
is it knocking on something ?
oh .

as you know there 's a lot of stuff
on the top .
in other words mummy , clean your fridge .
that 's it .
right .
hands now .
all clean .
let me have a look .
that 's that 's not bad .
the the fridge is a bit
other one .
that looks a bit sticky that one , at the back , does it ?

did you like the breakfast ?
come on .
right .
i have n't got my glasses .
i wo n't be able to see it .
oh .
it 's pc pinkerton anyway , it 's not even rosie and jim .

something weird is happening there .
i know that 's
mummy wash up .
this thing , is it on , off ?
has it been on ?
it 's not been on , no , i 've just switched it on .
right , toast and marmite , times two .
i think everything on this erm , machine is to do with food , do n't you ?
probably is .
you need to sort of stop and talk when you have food .
yes .
yes please cup of tea are making it then ? good !
i did manage to sort out the food for tomorrow and
did you really ?
that 's very clever !
well i thought .
did you manage to do alright ?
yeah .
found .
i mean pinched one of for starters , that makes a difference .
did you try it did you ?
no !
ah ho ,
a pathetic film on , i do n't
ah !
know what it was about , but it was pathetic !
ah !
mm .
what 's happening tomorrow ?
what do you mean , what 's happening tomorrow ?
well what is it tomorrow morning and evening and things .
what ?
what is it tomorrow morning and evening , and what are we going to do in the afternoon without ?
!
i know we 'll cope but what are you going to do ?
are we inviting anyone ?
i know we 're not inviting anybody for lunch christmas day could n't cope with that but it would be quite to have them in the afternoon ca n't cope with the people !
oh yeah .
suppose we should do something , yeah .
well that 's what i was thinking , perhaps we could go with somebody somewhere .
you know , like by a canal or something .
perhaps , well if it 's snowing it wo n't be quite the same .
that 's right .
conducive to tripping about !
but if it 's quite nice weather , it would be nice to invite somebody along i expect .
they could just .
stratford ?
yeah the stratford warriors running about every six weeks something like that .
is it six weeks since we saw the last one then ?
they did n't , they , they have them more frequently now and they 're getting even more and more infrequent now for the rest of the year .
mm .
and next one .
that 's mother 's day twenty second .
is it ?
no .
mother 's day a fortnight
twenty ninth .
somebody will organize a party for tuesday
yeah they want a party piece on tuesday .
it 's alright you do n't have to , of cake .
if i do n't bake them now my mother .
yeah well tell your mother .
i 'll have to
yeah i will .
get one !
and it better be a nice one !
pop into marks and spencers they have some amazing shapes in marks and spencers that the children will enjoy .
really ?
mind you it might be expensive .
tesco 's are probably cheaper .
you remember that tom and jerry i got for tim ?
because i could n't be bothered to cook it .
well , leave it up to me , i 'll see what i can get i 'll get for the party .
thank you dear .
is that alright ?
yeah .
i 'll get you some .
and i 'll just make the rest of the with salad in .
you 're not supposed to .
i 've told you what we 're gon na for christopher have n't i ?
i know , he went to school to do
yeah .
housework .
is that naughty ?
thursday morning .
right , christopher will be back too !
i wish i could i 'd like to
you what ?
out at the meeting again on monday night .
on monday ?
where are you going monday ?
going to sue 's house .
oh right the big housewife !
the housewife mhm .
like cooking this week .
ah , i 'm having jane for a piano lesson , are n't i ?
what day ?
which day ?
monday .
are you ?
oh well
so that fits in quite well i could n't remember what i was doing on monday but we said , sort of tentatively monday would be probably quite a good day i think .
better than thursday anyway .
so could tuesday night be inspector morse night ?
yeah cos my mum will be here then .
oh right can we not take her home ?
unpaid !
well she 'll
we shall see !
have been here all day , wo n't she ?
so she might want to go home !
she wants to tell us all about her wedding
could you tell her we 're going to watch inspector morse !
for the third or fourth time !
will she have watched inspector morse ?
she wo n't of watched it , cos it 's bound to be on a wednesday night !
does she like inspector morse ?
i do n't think she watches it normally .
no , she probably does n't like it .
a bit spicy !
i bet she would , she loves anything like that !
bit of a body !
mind you , it might be too complicated !
it was i remember reading in the paper that it 's been it 's been filmed at a house which no one 's ever been allowed to go in even the great sort of one of these country mansions , it was not
right .
and even people who write about
if it was not , it ca n't be again , they 're always going in there !
well that 's fine .
it was some country mansion in oxfordshire you know ?
mm .
it 's as you come off the
and how did
and
they get permission then ?
they somehow managed to persuade the owners , apparently it was and it was and nobody else had ever been allowed in this place not even erm historians who write about famous buildings , even they had been refused access !
where is it ?
somewhere in oxfordshire .
oh !
they do n't know where ?
oh .
so
this was about last week 's episode ?
i think it was about last week 's , but they seem to imply that it was last week 's episode that would
oh .
do it .
we seem to have got one spare video if we do n't get it watched before wednesday .
alright .
well that 's the only chance .
oh yeah cos we 're going to maryland tomorrow .
your dad .
mm .
erm not it was n't about your dad , it was about my birthday cos
cos
he 'd realized that it was my birthday , and , what did i want ?
so i said send me a cheque and i 'll go and shop .
and ?
and last week cos she 's quite generous is n't she ?
she is a bit but it 's .
no , i did n't say anything .
i think that 's the thing .
so your dad sent a cheque .
anyway i asked her if she 'd heard from your dad , and she has heard from your dad apparently on friday he went to the consultant
mm .
and next week he 's got his first well she did n't know whether it was radiotherapy or chemotherapy .
and she said he has to go trotting to exeter two or three times a week now .
mm .
i do n't know how long it 's going to go on for , or what it is exactly but i thought it would be a good idea to ring your dad up and see .
mm .
but at least things have moved , and at least they 've gone round .
so i 'm pleased really , are you ?
interesting that they 've done it so quickly is n't it ?
after seeing him , because he thought that once he 'd seen the consultant it would then take some time to get the treatment started , but they must have got themselves over that .
yeah .
well i mean everyone .
yeah .
i think .
got ta get moving .
and presumably whatever it was the gp had give him has had , upset that thrombosis again .
i do n't know whether to ring him tonight , oh it 's too late tonight now .
it 's much too late .
perhaps we could ring tomorrow afternoon when the children are up ?
well they love talking to them on the phone do n't they ?
i know they do .
we could can prime them up on what to say and types of things to talk about so they do n't get moaned down or something !
bogged down !
so he 's had to go in , what did you say ?
three times a week ?
i do n't know she just said
something like that
a few times a week and i think it sounded like three cos she was wondering how he would cope with driving and everything .
mm a trial !
well i hope not i mean no he wo n't be able to drive
but presumably your mum can do that for , they 've got hundreds of people there , he 's always driving people everywhere
that 's right .
so i do n't see why they ca n't drive him !
i 'm sure they will
yes .
cos they 're very good are n't they ?
i mean look at that woman doing her er from the from the church .
at times like this it would be nice if we lived nearer could help out .
it would nice if we lived there but we ca n't so
it 's about .
and write as well .
yes .
double dose .
yes .
and pulled out .
well it 's sort of pulled out , but at least it 's .
we 'll be paying for it as well .
and it 's hard as well .
we 've been paying anyway , so it must of you know .
what does erm you see er eileen 's and she 's having chemotherapy is n't she ?
by , by medication , is
that right ?
well she takes all these tablet things .
that 's right she has a sort of massive dose every now and then .
and that makes her feel what ?
she 's not in pain is she ?
more sort of dopey .
i would n't care if they made me dazed
yeah .
!
yeah .
i du n no .
not gon na
difficult to know .
oh yes , that was it !
i wonder how bad it is , that feeling 's like , we do n't really know how bad it is do we ?
no .
perhaps he will be able to say , you know ?
but whether he 'd tell us over the telephone , you think ask .
i think he would would n't he ?
i think so .
cos we 've got the agm in two weeks time
mm .
and we voted all these people that are here
what type of this ?
well you just
it does n't matter .
you just come along do n't you find out
what we do with all the money , and you find out who 's doing what , and who 's doing you know ?
mm .
it 's it 's quite exciting really !
if you !
but i 've
these little things
you could n't show me something
alright
you see , cos it 's
we 're confusing her now cos
this is where we 're going not towcester alright ?

how many little do you have ?
it varies considerably you can have eight you can up to fourteen except fifteen why , how many do you want in ?

right .
she said ooh , you know can i invite a couple of friends , can i invite sort of you know , people back to lunch but when it 's sort of the list i mean , cos i i 'm not

but i 'll find them , and you wo n't have any bother .
oh i know , but i mean sort of there , i do n't know she would actually when it comes to it , but if we see her up there cos we can do the
it 's nice to see erm michael and sophie
yeah .
actually it 's quite a cosy group , so they probably know each other by
yeah .
now then .
yeah .
looks a bit agitated !
but anyway
that 's somebody that would would be a few
telling everyone about her mum and dad when they and erm how she talked to her mum about that , and it helped her .
but her mum i mean i know
cos i mean , i know her mum .
she
well vaguely , but
are they moving to to be with someone else or
i do n't know , i mean i do n't
but perhaps he does n't want to change till cos she 'll
yeah but she
so whether they think , well so it 's after six months ,
well
i du n no .
is that alright ?
they were , they were really nice .
i hate being sick and one thing another well , it turned out
yeah you do .
yeah .
sophie was supposed to be doing the chorus so i grabbed mary , and said come with me on the half way through , called sophie why are you doing all the talking dot and not mary !
cos she
cos she 's supposed to be andy !
oh !
so , sarah had a job to do , but it was n't , sort of , till the end , and we 're gon na finish too quickly because normally we have it like paul and helen being really with it and look there 's sort of upward
oh no !
and then down below there 's helen you know christopher and
yeah
then laura 's with him .
but none of them turned up to today so
actually can you really face the from the other pathfinders
mm cos she 'll see you there .
cos we 're having , not problems , but at school it really it 's unfortunate because she was put in a third year , and she 's only a third year now and she was on a third year class last year .
who else is there with her in there ?
they 're all
well we 've actually chose the brownies now her age .
yeah .
yeah .
but it really hit her this year , we felt quite disgruntled
yeah .
that i really but i mean last year still not finished !
she 's really funny !
so we had a laugh , well said he when he woke up , he said day one you can do three on one day !
mind you , she 's like that , better get
when you 're feeling keen i said , you can do a lot and then
they 're rather weed , i know my two even .
erm rather than
i suppose cos he 's done that at school
yeah , that 's right !
they come home they 've got ta snuggle up in bed with a book
yeah .
you know , or patrick 's into psalms , she loves poetry
psalms , i thought !
why not !
i used to do it , oh what psalm is it she ?
i 've forgotten , about being in mud was it a ?
, she did it .
yeah .
but as they do , it 's gon na hit her cos it 's not year that it does n't help , see if she 's in a third year class , she was always as she is now , in the top of that , but even
that 's right .
when she was only a second year therefore that means , she 's not given enough work , but i mean
i know what you mean .
she 's sort of got with children then because this erm testing , they 've got to a school work outside
curriculum .
they 've , that 's it , they do have to take them on to

the next
i mean
yeah well she 's sort of with the third year and will admit she 's so fed up !
but i , i 'm
oh yeah .
there 's a lot of !
i mean i 'm glad she 's er september , and an august birthday , i would of hated to have gone
well i 'm glad of that my children cos all
yeah .
mine are like that ,
and it does mean that they can relax you know about work and everything
yeah .
cos you know they 're a million times ahead .
they 've got an extra .
yeah have n't got to worry .
all of them so when her class came up , cos she 'd been with the class right from nursery and when she put into this you know , with the double third year , cos they go upstairs for third and fourth year and they really do classes below she did n't know anything in the class !
no !
i mean er she , they were n't
no i suppose er it 's a bit hard on , the kid , sort of , work wise , expecting her to be her to be er ahead , but not
but friends means such a lot do n't they , at that age ?
yeah .
they see .
oh right yeah .

oh , oh no , you 're getting confused , you know the book that is out , that is on
yes , yes
beginning careers , well it is in a catalogue , the book is in a catalogue , yeah , so there 's a front cover of the book sitting in the catalogue smiling at her , saying please buy this book of christopher .
oh i see , so he 's even more liked
yeah
we do n't want to buy it , we just want the catalogue
i see , oh
so she 's ordered it because
she 's started liam , they 're having a pre-packed school at durham choir boys , whatever it is , cos he 's from school , apparently the locality of demanding six year olds and under so they and another labouring school
oh
oh tim
put it on there , oh it 's too late to put it on there , oh that 's alright do it like that
i ca n't

it 's when we 're going to take it in the kitchen and put it away when we 've finished .
anyway
i 've had enough
right , just , she said she 's going to be head of department , it starts at ten ok , so she 'll be ahead of herself , then as she 'll be responsible for getting staff said she still has n't , got she said , little love
i did n't want a , a whole
timothy wanted the whole dear
they 've both got whole
oh that 's clever
that 's it
they they both had half a whole , i thought that 's what you said half a whole

the one with you chop the chop and then there will be squares
