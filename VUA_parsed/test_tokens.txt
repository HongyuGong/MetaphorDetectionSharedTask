the labour party conference : policy review throws a spanner in the whitehall machinery
by colin hughes , political correspondent
an incoming labour government would turn large areas of whitehall upside down — but the party 's policy review barely considers the implications of its plans for restructuring government departments .
scattered through the policy review are proposals to : drastically alter the status and organisation of the department of trade and industry ; create two departments — a department of consumer affairs , and a department for legal administration ; create a department of environmental protection within the existing department of the environment ; set up a plethora of new commissions and executive agencies ; set up a women 's ministry .
those are only the most overt changes advocated in the review papers .
the only department which explicitly escapes unscathed is the one which conservatives would most like to abolish : the department of energy .
in virtually every case the aim of causing upheaval is explicitly declared , because labour 's aim would be to upset the bureaucratic order it inherits .
new departments and quangos would , according to the review , be designed to act as irritants and antagonists within the civil service system .
but the policy review nowhere considers the overall effect of the individual changes proposed , or how they might be co-ordinated .
nor does it contemplate the knock-on consequences for labour ministers of attempting to implement their programme while rebuilding the governmental machine .
the ‘ medium term industrial strategy ’ which would form the centrepiece of labour 's economic policy would , according to the productive and competitive economy review group , be ‘ administered by a transformed department of trade and industry ’ .
the review adds : ‘ what we now seek is a dti which will have an equal , if not superior status , to that of the treasury . ’
that approach would seek to knock out a keystone of civil service tradition .
labour policy has long sought to challenge the treasury 's dominance in government .
but its last effort — the department of economic affairs , set up by harold wilson and headed by george brown — ended in futile departmental and ministerial infighting .
there would in addition be a minister for science and technology at the newly supreme dti , with responsibility for determing investment in research .
there is no mention in the education policy of how that might affect the department of education and science .
but while the dti would override the treasury , a new ‘ powerful department of consumer affairs ’ would antagonise the dti .
it would be headed by ‘ a minister of cabinet rank ’ and act as ‘ the consumers ’ voice with other government departments ' .
its remit for inter-departmental intrusion would be wide , with ‘ a watching brief over government action ’ and the ability to initiate consumer legislation .
only the women 's ministry would be given equal license .
it would be able to ‘ require each government department to review its policies , practices , and existing and proposed legislation ’ .
while new departments are born and others extended , one of the oldest — the home office — would become a shadow of its present self .
labour 's proposed department for legal administration would take over responsibility for courts and tribunals ; court procedures ; organisation , training and appointment of the legal profession , magistracy and judiciary ; legal aid ; legal services ; and the sentencing council .
that would leave the home office with policing , penal policy and the criminal law .
responsibility for the sex discrimination act , the equal pay act and the equal opportunities commission would be given to the women 's ministry .
the concept of a minister having cabinet rank — and therefore implicitly not being a member of the cabinet proper — crops up again on environment .
a ‘ new minister of environmental protection ’ would operate inside the doe .
that could work — though it is easy to imagine conflicts of interest with the housing and planning functions of the department .
more problematic will be labour 's plan for the ministry of agriculture , fisheries and food .
‘ the priority of maff must become food , not farming , ’ the policy review says .
‘ its main concerns would become food and the people who consume it , not farming and those who produce it . ’
but the regulatory functions over the food industry , now split between maff and the department of health , would transfer to a new food standards agency .
that is the first of many agencies , executives , commissions , and other quango-like bodies recommended by the review .
in some cases labour 's quangos merge existing ones , or replace well-established bodies .
the funding of higher education would become the responsibility of one body , rather than two .
labour 's quality commission would replace the audit commission .
but there would be new regulatory commissions and consumer councils for every utility , along with ombudsmen , and public interest commissioners appointed by the secretary of state .
there would be skills uk — a locally structured training commission — a fair wages commission , a health technology commission , a health quality commission , an education standards council , an independent sentencing council , a children 's commissioner , an environmental protection executive , and a social insurance fund administered by … ‘ an independent commission ’ .
an atmosphere poisoned by mistrust
by nicholas roe
the disposal of toxic wastes is one of the most intractable problems facing industrialised societies .
even though some of the most dangerous and persistent toxins , including polychlorinated biphenyls , pcbs , are no longer manufactured , quantities of them still exist , and must be got rid of .
but how ?
and where ?
on this page , nick roe visits a plant which , despite strenuous public relations efforts , has failed to convince its neighbours that it has come clean .
and richard north looks at current provisions for the destruction of pcbs , and at the history of british involvement in a rather uncomfortable growth industry the security guard at the entrance to one of britain 's mightiest hazardous waste disposal plants pressed a button and the gate opened .
then he pressed another knob and a big toy doll in his office window dropped its trousers .
you had to laugh .
yet this was rechem international 's high-temperature incineration plant at pontypool in gwent , south wales .
hardly a laughing matter , surely ?
beyond the barrier lay some of the most toxic chemicals known , awaiting destruction by fire .
what else ?
a vast , smoke-blackened furnace ; 100 people to do the work ; massive investment — the company spent £2m last year on cleaning up smoke emissions .
plus a backdrop of houses covering the valley walls on either side , a reminder that wherever industrialised societies decide to deal with their most intractable problems , they are unlikely to find a place to do so which is not in somebody 's back yard .
britain grinds out almost five million tonnes of hazardous waste each year , of which about 63,000 tonnes are so difficult to store or treat that they are burnt at high temperatures here in gwent or at one of three other centres : ellesmere port ; fawley , near southampton ; and the unfortunately named killamarsh , near sheffield .
five more incinerators currently proposed in various parts of the country will double capacity .
then there are the imports : 83,000 tonnes of toxic waste enter british ports annually for incineration or other treatment , a figure which has increased 20-fold in just eight years .
in these environmentally conscious times , this is an uncomfortable growth industry .
liverpool dockers recently turned back parts of a 1,500-tonne consignment of canadian pcbs ( polychlorinated biphenyls ) bound for this plant in gwent .
in doing so , they underlined a fact which is likely to attract more and more attention as tankers continue to shift toxins from town to town , country to country : the waste chain is long .
it snakes in and out of ports , along our busiest highways and through our most crowded cities .
anxieties which are currently felt most acutely by those living near destruction plants themselves may not always remain so localised .
at pontypool , the collision between a precise , scientific industry and a diffuse , unscientific local suspicion is painfully apparent .
local people mutter and march , make speeches and throw things ; staff face sarcasm in nearby pubs ; and for years there have been demands for a public inquiry .
rechem has responded with a rather desperate open-door policy aimed at soothing fears , and more recently by issuing about a dozen writs against the fiercest critics .
‘ we are an aggressive company , ’ admitted david wheeler , operations director at this plant and at rechem 's other incinerator , at fawley .
for a place so hated , the pontypool plant looks innocuous inside , like a cross between an oil refinery and a crematorium .
mr wheeler , an engineer who worked for many years in the oil business , is a pleasant , slightly worried-looking man who can not bear the fact that no one seems to realise just what lengths he goes to in order to keep the plant squeaky clean and emission-free .
in hard hats and protective glasses , we walked past the huge ‘ fume cupboard ’ where the most noxious barrels are opened , and arrived at the vast , closed mouth of the furnace itself .
it was hot , but not burning .
there was a fault on the computer governing the plant , said mr wheeler , and the fire had automatically shut down .
these pipes stretching thinly in a bridge across the service road injected a mix of chemicals into the walls of the furnace itself ; did i know that fuel was only used in the start-up process , after which the chemicals themselves provided the fire ?
workers in blue overalls drifted around us and cracked jokes in gentle welsh accents .
in the furnace control office i found shift foreman keith thomas and asked innocently if he had any physical problems : ‘ not since my vasectomy . ’
a grin .
he lived locally , so how did neighbours view his job here ?
‘ you get sarcasm mainly .
a lot of my friends are pleased that the company is doing the job they are doing .
others are not so well informed .
you could n't hope to convert them . ’
at a nearby house , leonard hough , a retired schoolmaster , had earlier told me about ‘ the fog ’ which he says comes from the factory .
‘ it blows along the valley .
they 've improved the chimney recently and it 's very much better than it was but we still get the smells .
and since they 've refused repeatedly to have a public inquiry into what is going on there we 're not certain of the safety of what 's coming out .
we get smoke from the steel works across the valley , but we know what that is and we 're not afraid of it . ’
keith thomas pressed a button and a huge door clanked upwards so that i could peer into the heart of the furnace .
piles of ruddy-brown ash lay heaped on the floor .
pumps sucked air inwards .
heat shone out .
in here , they burn about 30,000 tonnes of chemicals a year , a quarter originating outside britain .
the waste arrives at the rate of up to seven tanker-loads every day — that is seven lorries passing thousands of doorsteps .
right here , in this gaping mouth , lies the end of the chain .
the wastes include lindane , ddt , out-of-date drugs , carcinogenic chemicals , old cigars and even pornography ( a different kind of pollution ) .
about 7,000 tonnes of the total waste is pcb-contaminated .
pcbs are so difficult to destroy , that rechem 's emission-monitoring systems are geared to detecting them on the grounds that if you destroy pcbs you destroy everything .
this , of course , is a key point .
if you did not burn chemicals like pcbs , what else would you do with them ?
the sea ?
the earth ?
‘ we are not in the business of polluting the environment , ’ mr wheeler insisted .
‘ we are on the side of the angels . ’
environmental organisations , however , put the emphasis elsewhere .
‘ there is no incinerator which completely destroys toxic wastes , ’ madeleine cobbing , greenpeace 's toxics campaigner , told me .
‘ the crux of our argument is that we do n't need to have toxic wastes and the fact that plants like rechem exist , providing easy options for companies , is acting as a disincentive for companies to clean up . ’
but — another but — what about the pcbs that already exist ?
although they are no longer manufactured , they are still present , for example in electrical equipment .
no one could therefore call for the closure of incineration plants at a stroke , because noxious chemicals have to go somewhere .
so a part of the argument switches to the kind of incinerators you allow while industry is forced to clean itself up .
also , how these should function and — perhaps most important of all — where you put them .
mr wheeler , now moving to the rear of the plant to show off the £2m smoke-cleaning section , which had just broken down , pointed out that his company achieved destruction of at least 99.9999 per cent of all materials .
the company 's figures imply that when you have burnt 99.9999 per cent of a 30,000-tonne annual throughput , a figure of 0.03 of a tonne remains .
in 1986 , according to friends of the earth , a survey of the homes clustered on the surrounding hills found that three-quarters of 800 residents were opposed to the rechem plant .
‘ the plant should be relocated because it 's in the wrong place , ’ llew smith , the local euro-mp , told me .
‘ it is in a valley and in a highly populated area . ’
what did mr wheeler make of that ?
‘ if we do it properly any spot is the right spot , ’ he insisted .
stack emissions of pcbs were below the american standard for breathing air - 1,000 times lower than the british equivalent .
regular soil and grass tests showed no difference between pcb contamination in the immediate area and elsewhere in wales — though there are no established ‘ safe ’ levels for these .
five air-monitoring plants had been installed ( he took me to see them ) .
and here were drums of chemicals , each labelled , each with a job number to check against sampling .
and yet there are accidents .
in 1987 , aluminium melted in the furnace , reacted with water and exploded , sending a black cloud over nearby houses .
later , drums supposedly containing carcinogenic drugs were not opened for checking before burning ( for health reasons ) and three were ‘ misdescribed ’ .
they , too , reacted with water , and a plant operator was burned by a cloud of acid gas .
we walked past a tanker where a huge man named andy matthews was pumping vinyl acetate into a 10,000-gallon vat , wreathed in its sweet , sickly smell : ‘ i 've been here two years , ’ he said .
‘ my father was an industrial chemist and he said if you want to go and work for them , go and work for them . ’
were there any spillages ?
he shrugged .
‘ nothing major .
i might drop a pipe — a little bit of a splash . ’
in a large , prefabricated shed we wandered past stacks of 45-gallon drums of pcbs , two drums high , about 10 deep ; and there were contaminated transformers waiting to be cut up and roasted in the flames .
back along the waste chain , the liverpool dockers who objected to the import of exactly this type of chemical should be aware that pcbs are moving about our roads all the time .
there was no difference between the liquid in these drums and the liquid in the cargoes they refused to touch .
in liverpool , a dockers ' spokesman with the transport and general workers union admitted : ‘ drivers are n't happy handling some of these commodities , but at least a lorry-driver has more idea of what he is handling than a docker , who could have a consignment and just not know what it is . ’
yet he did not oppose all toxic waste movement ( after all , the same union represents workers at rechem itself ) ; he simply did n't like the idea that big industrial nations like canada could dump their dirty problems on this country and his members .
driving away , i noticed that the vast chimney was still not functioning , but when i called at a neighbouring house a woman showed me videos she had taken of smoke coming from the plant , settling in her garden .
certainly the incinerator seems well controlled .
certainly there is no scientific evidence that living nearby increases the risk of sickness .
certainly , mr wheeler convinced me that his company was going to huge lengths to keep itself clean .
‘ we must run it safely in the short term and long term , ’ he said , ‘ because if people are able to demonstrate that we are causing an environment problem we will be shut down . ’
in april 1985 a tanker spilled 200 litres of pcbs over the main trans-canada highway on the border between ontario and manitoba .
a section of the road was shut for a week and motorists were warned to clean their cars and to dispose of the rags in plastic bags .
law : always take along a friend to sue : litigation can pay off even in the unlikeliest circumstances .
stephen gold explains
by stephen gold
when things go wrong you can sue more often than you may think .
money may not have changed hands .
someone may have even done you a favour .
it does n't matter .
as long as you can show that they owed you a legal duty to be careful and have been negligent , damages could come your way .
there are a number of points to bear in mind .
take up references before giving credit , lending money , letting in tenants , taking on staff .
ask banks , building societies , former landlords , present and past employers .
if you rely to your detriment on a misleading reference which was given negligently , you should be able to sue the referee .
the subject of a bad reference can sue the referee for libel but has to show the referee was upto no good : spite , ill-will or some improper motive will do .
take along a prosperous adviser on all shopping sprees , demonstrate a high degree of trust and strong reliance in what they say and you may have unexpected protection should the seller go out of business and the goods fall to pieces .
a 26-year-old woman accountant who knew nothing about the mechanical side of vehicles asked her more knowledgeable friend to find a car for her .
she stipulated that it must never have been involved in an accident .
the friend found one at a garage .
although he failed to check it had been accident-free , he assured the lady that this was the case .
she bought it .
it had been in an accident and it was worthless .
in may last year the court of appeal upheld a judgment against the friend for more than £5,500 damages for negligence because he had owed the accountant a duty of care .
your conservatory collapses as a result of negligence of the professionals who were engaged by the previous owner to put it up .
you can sue the professionals — builders , architects , surveyors or engineers — by courtesy of the defective premises act 1972 , despite the fact that you never had a contract with them yourself .
there are strict time limits : generally , six years from when damage first occurred ; where the damage was initially ‘ latent ’ you are given longer — three years from when you could have discovered it , with a longstop of 15 years .
it may also be possible to claim damages against a local authority for negligently failing to ensure that construction work complied with the relevant building regulations .
a solicitor fails to draw up a will within a reasonable time for a client who subsequently dies .
you lose the gift which the will would have made .
you can sue the solicitor for what you would have collected , had he done his job properly , because the law reckons he owed you , as well as his client , a duty of care .
when you want to borrow on a mortgage , the prospective lenders will have the property valued at your expense .
there is no contract between you and the valuer .
but if the valuer is negligent and you buy the property relying on his report , you may still be able to sue him for damages .
this is what the house of lords decided in two cases last april in spite of an attempt to get the valuers off the hook by a disclaimer which said : ‘ i accept that the valuer does not warrant anything stated in his report as being accurate …
‘ alas , disclaimers may work if , for example , the property being valued is industrial or an expensive house .
disclaimers may also be used by referees and others to rob you of a claim for damages .
whoever attempts to hide behind a disclaimer must prove it is fair and reasonable to do so .
but a disclaimer can never take away your rights under the defective premises act 1972 for the collapsing conservatory or prevent anyone being sued for negligence which has caused death or injury .
have we yet reached the point at which we would be awarded damages against the meteorological office because we went camping on the day of an unforecast hurricane ?
or after we followed the duff advice of a legal journalist in a newspaper ?
mercifully , we doubt it !
book review / the cause without a rebel : ‘ the pale companion ’ — andrew motion : viking , 11.95 pounds
by martin pacey
it was unfair of auden to suggest , in his ‘ letter to lord byron ’ , that a poet 's ‘ sense of other people 's very hazy ’ .
but the vaporous presences that float through this slender and anaemic first novel by a notable poet would appear to support the claim .
the book — which opens a projected sequence of novels that will cover the period from 1968 to the present day — aims to explore what the blurb describes as ‘ the painful transition from youth to adulthood ’ .
this , of course , is a popular subject : it seems particularly attractive to the poet-turned-novelist because of the scope it offers for the tremulously sensitive probing of feelings .
sensitivity , though , is not enough .
what andrew motion presents us with here is a static and humourless mood-piece filled with over-elaborate imagery .
the hero , francis mayne , is suffering from the adolescent 's emotional confusion and acute self-consciousness .
he finds it hard to communicate with people , not least his separated parents .
his father is a faceless figure : a retired brigadier , reserved and taciturn .
his mother , by contrast , is the most vividly realised character in the book : nervy , flirtatious and selfish , already on her third husband , she thinks primarily of her appearance , even when visiting her dying daughter , francis 's twin .
the first half of the novel is dominated by the girl 's death from leukaemia .
there is a refreshing simplicity and tenderness in motion 's account of the way francis nurses her , but she herself is too sketchily drawn for the episode to carry much weight .
meanwhile , at his public school , francis is conducting a love-affair with an older pupil named keith ogilvie .
he is finally rejected by the devious , arrogant keith , who informs him that he is ‘ obsolete ’ because he does not ‘ know how to make things happen ’ .
his response to this rejection is as flat as his reaction to the massive demonstration which keith has earlier persuaded him to join against the vietnam war .
this violent event , described at length in hysterically colourful terms , is the only piece of history to be woven convincingly into the plot .
other broad hints as to the date are inserted with a comical lack of subtlety : ‘ my god , darling , have you heard ? ’ exclaims francis 's mother one day as she greets him , ‘ czechoslovakia .
it 's been invaded . ’
motion will have to do better than this if he seriously intends his series of novels to capture the feel of a period .
but the book 's principal defect remains the vacuity of its protagonist .
in his eagerness to depict the cloudy psychology of an adolescent , motion has forgotten to give the boy a personality .
he has , however , given him a psychotic compulsion to formulate fanciful similes .
hardly a page goes by without the hapless francis noticing something which reminds him , improbably , of something else .
sometimes he is reminded of several things .
one moment an avenue of chestnut trees looks ‘ like a child 's drawing of ghosts ’ ; the next it appears ‘ frightening but derelict , like extinguished chandeliers ’ ; and finally the chestnuts ‘ prance at him , holding up their gleaming branches like hysterics . ’
such writing rapidly palls , and i hope that in the novels to come , motion can curb his reckless passion for it .

from marc champion in washington
secateurs are likely to be the tool most in demand now .
the summer 's sprawl begins to be oppressive at this stage in the year and trigger fingers are itching to snip back overgrown mallows , clear out the mildewing foliage of golden rod and reduce the overpowering bulk of bullyboy ground cover .
keep away from jasmine , already thick in flower bud , and clematis , however untidy .
buddleias , although messy , should not be cut back until spring .
dead , ragged heads of the climbing hydrangea can be removed , cutting where the stem joins the main branch .
virginia creeper needs to be clipped back from windows and hauled out of gutters .
mulching is a pleasant activity for october .
it can be done in spring too , but there are usually more pressing jobs then .
shrubs such as hydrangea particularly relish rich rations .
it is a good time to plant hardy shrubs too .
clematis so bristles with brittle green shoots in spring that planting then is an anxiety rather than a pleasure .
runner beans and french beans have now given up completely and can be cleared off vegetable plots .
globe artichokes are sprouting new leaves and may need protection from frost in cold areas .
summer bedding is looking tired and should be removed so that the ground can be cleaned and fed ready for spring bulbs or wallflowers .
design : crossed lines over the toytown tram : city transport could soon be back on the right track , says jonathan glancey
by jonathan glancey
modern trams , as most continental europeans know , neither shake nor rattle , nor do they roll .
sleek , solidly built , gentle on the environment , they are often an ideal form of city transport .
they also exert a fascination very much of their own as they slither round circuses and brush through old city gates , flashing arcs of lightning as they switch tracks on winter nights .
single-car , articulated or double-decker , trams are one of the most reliable and enduring forms of public transport invented .
the orange-liveried ‘ 1500 ’ series trams in milan , for example , date from 1927 .
eventually they will be replaced , but more than 60 years on they run with the rhythmic reliability of a swiss watch .
they are as much a part of milan as la scala or the galleria vittore emmanuele .
last month it was announced that britain will get its first new-wave trams in 1991 .
destined to run in manchester , they will relieve traffic congestion and help to reduce the levels of carbon monoxide in the city centre , outlying suburbs and satellite towns of bury , altrincham , salford , oldham and rochdale .
in britain , with the main exception of blackpool ( not forgetting the single-deckers of the isle of man and llandudno ) , trams had been largely relegated to the history books .
otherwise , the best place to see working trams has been the tram museum at crich in derbyshire or else in old british transport commission films and ealing comedies .
trams disappeared from most british cities in the 1950s .
london 's venerable red and cream double-deckers rumbled along the thames embankment for the last time in 1952 .
somehow the image of the tall , thin , mournful double-deck tram with its wooden body , slatted wooden seats and growling electric motor has stuck in the british mind .
trams , it was believed until surprisingly recently , are old-fashioned .
they had something to do with fish and chips wrapped in newspaper , men in hats , national health specs , smog and powdered egg .
they held up the bright new diesel buses and , even worse , blocked the progress of private motorists in bulbous austins and lumpen humbers in canyon-like city thoroughfares .
they picked up power from a spider 's web of unsightly overhead wires .
they were inflexible in operation , draughty , and mobile reminders of tb epidemics with the enamelled ‘ do not spit ’ signs screwed to their bulkheads .
but the modern tram could hardly be more different .
it plays a key role in keeping city streets on the move and is even the object of the best modern designers ' desire .
in milan , for example , the commission to design the new generation of ‘ jumbo ’ trams , which went into service in 1979 , was one that leading italian architects and designers fought over .
after all , the jumbo , a handsome and imposing articulated unit designed by architect , engineer and critic klaus giovanni koenig , will be seen on the streets of milan for the next half-century .
spotlessly clean and popular , the jumbo is a long-term advertisement for koenig 's design skills .
the modern tram is a green machine .
assuming the power station at the end of the line burns cleanly , the tram is virtually pollution free .
standing at traffic lights a koenig-designed jumbo is , save for the chatter inside , completely silent .
the overhead wires are so slight that you have to look hard to see them .
powers of acceleration and braking are remarkable , the latter far greater than any car .
but sadly , there is no indication that the gma consortium which will design , operate and maintain the first of the new generation british trams in manchester will share the looks of their milanese counterparts .
artists ' impressions show a tram that has more in common with the flat-faced , characterless light trains of the toy-like docklands light railway .
there is still time for gma ( gec , mowlem , amec and greater manchester buses ) to consider employing an inspired architect or industrial designer .
after all , mancunians and visitors to the manchester conurbation are going to have to look at these mechanical millipedes for well into the twenty-first century .
now that buses are no longer designed to enhance the streets they serve , manchester has a chance to make a fresh start with its trams .
manchester is not alone .
other british towns , croydon and southampton among them , are also considering modern tramways .
these are all referred to as ‘ supertram ’ networks , the implication being that the new-generation tram is an altogether more dynamic form of transport than its pre-war predecessors .
what it really means is that the new trams are a hybrid between street car and lightweight suburban train .
although they will slip through the city centre serving the essential parts — shopping malls , leisure centres , theme parks , amusement arcades and museums — the manchester supertrams will also head out of town on a mix of reserved track and existing railway lines .
the supertram is , in effect , a low-cost replacement for british rail 's ageing fleet of suburban diesel multiple-unit trains , those rasping diesels which change gear to the accompaniment of voluminous clouds of acrid black exhaust fumes and the blessing of train spotters .
they will perform some of the same functions , but they will not be an exact replacement for traditional trams .
and although the supertram concept will spread through major cities during the next decade , blackpool will still be alone in its use of traditional double-deckers .
musicals / bows of holly : mark steyn reviews london 's latest musical biography , buddy , at the victoria palace
by mark steyn
the texans drawl ‘ y'all ’ , blacks go ‘ yo ’ , hispanics leer ‘ hey , ameeeeeeeego ! ’ .
and towering above these stage cliches is , of course , the driven genius whose music can not be stemmed by the forces of reaction .
who is it this time ?
wagner , glenn miller , jason donovan ?
no matter ; only the accents change — and the pants : here , the squares wear slacks , the good guys blue-jeans .
warned not to sing rock'n'roll on a c&w station , buddy holly insists , ‘ i got ta play ma music . ’
misunderstood by decca records , he maintains , ‘ i wan na play ma music ma way . ’
even when the hits start , he 's not content .
‘ we got ta take our music more serious , ’ he tells the crickets , who remain unconvinced .
‘ you got money , you got fame , ’ he pleads , ‘ what you want to booze for ? ’
booze ?
we 're midway through act ii and a solitary six-pack has yet to hove into view .
but this is a plot development — the plot development — and , if it involves turning a couple of aled jones types into oliver reeds , why let logic get in the way ?
as it happens , there is a kind of logic behind buddy .
the most common reason for a biomusical is opportunism : take a star like judy garland or john lennon , and you pick up a hit title and a hit score ready-made .
now , alan janes 's play matches the well-loved songs with equally well-loved dialogue in a k-tel golden greats collection of dramatists ' reliables .
choke up at the price of fame : ‘ i give ‘ em everything and they stick a knife in my back . ’
fight back those tears at the inevitable parting : ‘ you and me , boy , i reckon we 've come to the end of our road . ’
marvel at the little woman behind the man : ‘ i 'd like to sing a song fer a special girlfriend who 's kinda important to me . ’
the justification for this is authenticity .
‘ all that happens in the play is based on fact , ’ janes pledges solemnly in the programme notes .
‘ as we know , truth is often stranger than fiction . ’
often ?
most of us prefer to watch dallas than our neighbours ' home-movies , because , when it comes down to it , we know that truth is generally a lot duller than fiction .
occasionally , though , a dramatist will uncover someone with an interesting story , regardless of how unknown or vaguely remembered the subject is .
how many of us can now recall the real maria von trapp or fanny brice ?
they live only through the sound of music and funny girl .
buddy holly comes somewhere between the subjects of those and more parasitic biographies .
his records are still played , but his personality , unexposed through movies or extensive tv interviews , is almost entirely unknown .
it is , in theory , the best of both worlds — except that buddy holly , by all accounts , was not terribly interesting .
he was born in lubbock , married a nice spanish girl and died young in a ‘ plane crash in 1959 .
all that counts are the records , a rhythmically unusual tex-mex fusion of rock'n'roll and older western elements , pioneering what became the standard pop instrumentation of two guitars , bass and drums .
the lyrics are another matter .
of the two prototype rock songwriters , it 's the more worldly chuck berry you turn to for the authentic picture of teenage pleasures in eisenhower 's america : ‘ gon na write a little letter , gon na mail it to my local deejay . ’
or : ‘ cruising and playing the radio with no particular place to go . ’
berry 's songs are plausible emblems of rock'n'roll rebellion or , at any rate , youthful hedonism .
buddy invites us to regard holly in the same light , mocking ( in a horribly nudging re-creation ) lubbock old-timers like the hayriders , who sing : ‘ when the sun goes down on blue ridge mountain it 's the time to whistle in your ear . ’
at least , this has a surreal daftness .
the voice of rock'n'roll , in contrast , is almost unrelievedly soupy .
if you did n't know the tunes , you 'd assume holly 's lyrics decorated some innocent backporch spooners from the turn-of-the-century : ‘ stars appear and the shadows are fallin' you can hear my honey callin' . ’
or : ‘ you give me all your lovin' and your turtle-dovin' . ’
or : ‘ when cupid shot his dart he shot it at your heart . ’
not only are these songs impossible to use dramatically , they 're also too vague to use as incidental music , to underline or punctuate aspects of holly 's life or the 1950s more generally .
‘ i wrote it for you , ’ he assures his gal before the ballads , but how can you tell ?
all you can do with these songs is sing them , and buddy fails even to manage that with any subtlety .
the finales to both acts are effectively concerts , the sort of agreeably naff rock'n'roll revival that might just about pass muster as a capital gold one-nighter down the hammersmith palais .
and , for all the appeal of his singing and playing , paul hipp comes out pretty dull between the numbers .
to camouflage the failures of the play , andy walmsley has created a set which resembles a pile-up of roadside hoardings : oldsmobile , van heusen shirts , texaco premium type .
rob bettinson , the director , has deduced that he ought to have these images plus disc-jockeys , radio commercials , midwestern hops , but he does n't seem to know why .
like most shows which are manufactured with an eye to commercial success ( winnie , high society , to name only buddy 's predecessors at the victoria palace ) , this one will probably fail .
it 's not as if there are n't aspects of his career that are n't worth exploring : how did he come to use drums , then almost unknown in texan country line-ups ?
was it true , as the chart performance of ‘ heartbeat ’ ( his last release ) suggests , that his three-year career was already on the wane ?
and surely any dramatist ought to be able to move us with that final night of holly 's life , when his musicians ( including waylon jennings ) gave their places on the ‘ plane to the big bopper and ritchie valens .
the author 's job is not merely to offer an illustrated who 's who entry , but to turn elements of a man 's life into a dramatic entity .
and , if holly 's too boring for that , perhaps the best approach would be to write about his impact on others .
that , after all , is what don mclean did so brilliantly in ‘ american pie ’ , a personal reaction to ‘ the day the music died ’ .
the us sets its compass on two trading oceans notebook .

canberra may seem an awful long way from exchanges on the floor of the house of commons over the european monetary system .
but were it not for the perceived economic might of a more unified economic community , the dozen or so nations of the pacific rim , who have been meeting in australia , might not have bothered .
the first , albeit tenative , steps towards forming a new pacific-based economic union display an astute awareness of the way events are moving within europe : movements with which number 10 has yet to come to grips .
not so long ago it seemed as if the world was to divide into three main trading blocks : the ec based around the west german economy ; a northern american block based around the us-canadian free trade area , and a pacific unit incorporating the asian tigers with japan and the yen at the centre .
but the metternich-like skills of the us secretary of state , mr james baker , are ensuring that america maintains a strong stake in each forum .
it firstly boldly asked for a seat at the top table at the european community : a suggestion rudely rebuffed .
the us has talked of a genuine north american free trade zone incorporating the us , canada and mexico which would have the best of all worlds with high-technology skills and a cheap labour force south of the rio grande .
now it is making a third bid for influence .
it has turned up in canberra with japan to develop asia pacific economic co-operation ( apec ) and a new 12-nation organisation which will mimic the role of the organisation for economic co-operation and development in europe .
preliminary steps taken to conduct studies on trade , technology and investment flows in the region may seem insignificant .
but mr baker plainly views it as otherwise .
he noted that the canberra meeting ‘ is the start of something which could grow into a very significant development not only for the region but for the global economy . ’
if the more economically puny asean countries ( indonesia , malaysia , singapore , brunei , thailand and the philippines ) were to bury their reservations , then the high growth from other partners , including such tigers as thailand and south korea alongside the more mature economies of japan and australia , could mean a dynamic coalition .
it would then be up to the us and canada to decide whether they want to face towards the atlantic or pacific — or be caught between two great trading oceans .
heading for default .
the question of just who would even want to be a partner with the us was underlined last night as the american administration headed for default for the first time in its history .
congress was frantically trying to complete a bill raising the federal debt ceiling in time for president bush to sign today .
leaders on capitol hill virtually put all other business on hold as it sought to hammer out a debt ceiling increase .
the treasury secretary nicholas brady , a level headed figure , warned that the imbroglio may lead to higher interest costs for the taxpayer .
what should have been a routine exercise in extending the government 's borrowing power to $3.1 thousand billion became bogged down in wrangling over legislative initiatives lawmakers wanted to attach to the bill .
as a result of the stalemate , the treasury has been forced to postpone $40billion in debt auctions this week .
lack of congressional action also forced the treasury to suspend new sales of us savings bonds and of special securities for state and local governments .
this market sensitive dispute has taken place as president bush and congress continued to spar on a primary cause for government borrowing — the budget deficit .
at a press conference to mark his election victory a year ago , mr bush threatened to veto the budget unless it contained real cuts .
otherwise congress would have to face the consequences of automatic across-the-board cuts under the gramm-rudman-hollings budget deficit reduction law .
america may have changed presidents a year ago , but the fiscal thicket remains as inpenetrable as ever .
political expediency .
no longer can the government disguise the crisis surrounding electricity privatisation .
ministers have already had to pull britain 's fleet of magnox reactors out of the float and delay the sell-off date by up to six months .
but it has now become clear that further drastic amendments are needed to flotation plans .
after months of turning deaf ears to warnings by the city and industry , the department of energy has at last conceded that nuclear plant can not be included in the share float without state support .
this leaves the energy secretary , mr john wakeham , with two options : he can either agree to underwrite any cost escalations in nuclear handling costs after privatisation , or he can swallow his pride , and pull all nuclear plant out of the impending sale .
whatever the outcome , the government 's willingness to continue pushing through the float during this parliament shows how ministers are prepared to put political expediency before the interests of the industry .
for the nuclear element in electricity privatisation is the coping stone on which the flotation plans are based .
national power was given 70 per cent of the cegb 's generating capacity in order to give it an economic mix of power .
the other 30 per cent is to be operated by powergen , the other cegb successor company .
take away or subsidise all nuclear power stations and you lose the commercial logic of the privatisation plans .
electricity privatisation needs to go back to the drawing board .
at the very least , the cegb should be divided into a wider range of generating companies to stimulate competition .
is it worth sacrificing the long-term future of britain 's biggest stateowned industry to make political capital in the run-up to the next election ?
22comment the guardianwednesday november 8 1989 more than just another disaster .
thirty five people died and others were maimed for life in the clapham rail disaster in december last year because work was done in a slovenly , haphazard way and was then left unchecked .
the disaster was all the more stunning because people had come to assume that such things did n't happen .
in most years , rail deaths are few : in some there are none at all .
clapham , indeed , accounts for nearly half the 77 fatalities of the last ten years : compare that with the 5,000 deaths and 300,000 injuries every year on the roads .
yet yesterday 's report on the clapham crash , confirming the picture which emerged throughout the hidden inquiry , makes an event which seemed at the time totally unexpected look almost inevitable .
this was a system hopelessly under strain .
under strain for a start because it was technically ill-equipped to avert disaster or to cope with the consequences when disaster struck ; under strain from commercial pressures which , as the inquiry puts it , ‘ compromised ’ safety ; under strain above all because the people on the spot could n't or would n't cope , were weary from gruesome working hours ( the senior signal technician who heads the list of the culpable had had only one day off in the past 13 weeks ) , lacked adequate training , or simply could n't be bothered .
the bulk of the blame for all that is placed on british rail , which knowingly permitted these things to continue .
though individuals are nailed , the greatest villain of all is the system .
in a desperately competitive climate , where anyone bright and competent could go down the road and pick up a better paid job with kinder hours and more congenial working conditions from someone like british telecom , the railways ran a service dependent on people who belonged to a narrow and inbred working culture , with outdated procedures of training and promotion , and an institutional reliance on overtime working , whose wholly disgraceful dimensions are symbolised by the fact that maximum weekly hours were only recently cut to 72 hours a week .
the transport secretary , mr cecil parkinson , assured the commons yesterday that financial considerations would not stand in the way of implementing sir anthony hidden 's 93 recommendations .
on the technical side , remedial work is in many cases already on the way .
but the job of lifting the standards of people employed , giving them proper training , and paying a wage which breaks dependence on overtime and lifts morale : this together must far exceed the costs of the technology , and it is n't by any means clear what the bill will be or where the money will come from .
all of which is not just a problem for a properly penitent british rail : it 's a problem for government too .
government fixes the format in which br has to work ; and if , as the hidden report attests , many of its problems today reflect lack of past planning , lack of farsighted investment , living from hand to mouth , then that is not just br 's doing .
government compounds all these problems when it sets down working parameters which fail to reflect the value the country gets from a system that is run efficiently , can shift people to destinations with exemplary speed and safety — as europe consistently demonstrates .
it is sad , and somewhat ominous , that so little of that should have been reflected in the sombre statement which mr parkinson made in the house yesterday ..
a service in chaos .
the nation 's ambulance service was in manifest chaos yesterday .
there was no service in london , with all 71 stations and 455 vehicles off the road .
the only accident and emergency relief was provided by the police , part-time st john ambulance volunteers running 20 vehicles , and the red cross .
outside the capital , accident and emergency services were being provided in most areas , but the ban on emergency work was tightened .
the service was facing its biggest crisis since the ambulances came to a stop in the winter of discontent ten years ago .
like labour in 1979 , the conservatives have put military ambulances on standby .
they move in today .
what has gone wrong ?
there are three key causes of the shambles : mr kenneth clarke ; the failure to separate emergency from non-emergency work ; and the whitley council negotiating machinery .
the health secretary accused the unions of ‘ posturing and pretending ’ to run a 999 service yesterday .
he was right .
by refusing to keep open two-way radio links , the crews had effectively ended a proper emergency service .
the move was signalled last week and , true to their promised response , management suspended the workers involved in the disruption .
but ‘ posturing and pretending ’ went far beyond the unions .
mr clarke has been indulging in just that himself , putting up the luckless duncan nichol , chief executive of the health service , to take the initial flak under the pretence that the dispute is not his direct responsibility .
yet it was mr clarke , not mr nichol , who was involved in the critical decisions — the cash limit for the nhs , the 6.5 per cent offer to ambulance workers ( compared to seven per cent for nurses , eight per cent for doctors and nine per cent for ancillary workers ) ; and today 's introduction of military ambulances .
ambulance workers on emergency work do deserve a much higher increase .
they have progressed far beyond routine first aid .
their paramedical skills cover highly technical procedures : intubation , infusion and defebrillation .
the crews are able to resuscitate heart attack patients , replace fluid intraveneously after severe blood loss , and insert tubes to maintain air supplies in unconconscious casualties .
yet the ambulance worker is only being offered £10,000 , when a fire officer is being given £13,000 and a metropolitan police constable can earn £25,000 .
but only two million out of the 20 million journeys which ambulance crews carry out each year are emergency calls .
nine out of 10 are routine calls , many of which could be carried out by mini cabs .
mr duncan nichol wants to separate the emergency from the non-emergency work .
he is right to pursue this line .
wiltshire and northumbria have already shown how much can be achieved .
the ramshackle whitley council negotiating machinery is the other reason why the ambulance workers have lost out .
until this year , the three independent review bodies which make recommendations for nurses , doctors and the professions allied to medicine have given much higher awards than the whitley councils .
as lord mccarthy noted some 13 years ago , the management side of the councils comprise ‘ employers who do not pay and paymasters who do not employ . ’
a much more flexible system which would allow local managers to negotiate local rates — on a national pay spine — is needed .
a crisis ; an agenda for reform and honesty .
one mr clarke can not duck away from if he wants to avoid a second winter of discontent ..
opening , closing .
prince charles is jolly good at opening things .
he needs to be for the next four days in hong kong , because he will be hard at work cutting ribbons and laying foundation stones .
the hong kong university of science and technology , the hong kong island divisional headquarters of the red cross , the new cultural centre , and many more .
he is even re-opening the already opened eastern harbour tunnel and subway crossing .
it is all standard royal stuff , but not much help to the millions who fear that hong kong will not remain open after 1997 .
the whole point of a visit to hong kong now , five months after tiananmen square , should be to declare with royal authority that britain shares the concerns of the hong kong people and is determined to do something about them .
there was already a rather perfunctory air to the queen 's visit three years ago , as if it were just a required coda to her tour of china .
when the prince and princess of wales quite rightly scrapped their tour of the mainland , they had the opportunity to make a contrasting point in hong kong .
unless they can say something relevant in the next four days , the many hong kong critics who believe the visit is a waste of dollars will be absolutely right .
it did not help at all that upon arrival yesterday the royal couple instantly touched base in that comforting symbol of past british power , the hong kong and shanghai bank .
if there is a failure of imagination to use the royal visit creatively it will also be a failure of nerve .
britain still can not decide when to play the mandarinate game of silence with the chinese and when to break the rules ( as beijing does all the time . )
the ideal tactics should be a mixture of both , but only if a clear message can be communicated to the hong kong people that someone is standing up for them somewhere .
instead the latest developments in sino-british relations have left them even more confused than before .
china claims that the hong kong government recently gave a written commitment to limit the activities of the pro-democracy movement in the territory .
the government denies this , but has published the text of a letter from its political adviser to the new china news agency ( beijing 's embassy in hong kong ) suggesting that it did .
in a tone of meek appeasement , the letter draws attention to the arrest by hong kong police of anti-china demonstrators outside the agency 's national day reception .
it also reminds beijing that permission has been refused for local protesters to erect a replica statue of democracy on a permanent site .
it ends by assuring beijing that the hong kong government will have ‘ a prudent regard for the special circumstances of hong kong and the interests and concerns of the chinese government . ’
meanwhile the flood of letters of a very different sort from anxious hong kong citizens to this and every other newspaper office continues .
so do the chinese press statements asserting that hong kong is ‘ entirely a business between china and britain ’ and should not be discussed , formally or informally , at any international forum .
the only two hong kong legislators who consistently dare to speak out , mr martin lee and mr szeto wah , have been threatened with expulsion from the committee now drafting china 's post-1997 basic law .
our latest foreign secretary has yet to publicly pick up the file marked hong kong .
there is still endless dithering on how broad a ‘ safety net ’ britain will extend to its citizens .
they may rightly feel that it is all really rather appalling .
letters to the editor
the day thrift turned into a nightmare .
by daniel john
george tyson is not a gambling man nor does he take unnecessary risks .
he does n't smoke or drink , and even if he wanted to , two heart attacks and a by-pass operation have made the decision for him .
by his own account , mr tyson is thrifty and states quite proudly that neither he or his wife rosie are a burden on any form of social or government support .
but that is why , at the age of 68 , mr tyson is not enjoying what he had hoped would be a comfortable retirement .
a life of saving had , by 1985 , given them a small nest-egg of £15,000 on which the interest would help supplement their pensions .
to the tysons , that meant nothing extravagant — just an extra £135 a month to make life at home in south ruislip , middlesex easier .
that money was invested as might be expected of the tysons .
and for three years , it earned its return , every month .
until one morning in june 1988 when george tyson turned on the radio to hear a small , investment business called barlow clowes had collapsed .
‘ it was about 8.30am and i was just getting dressed when it came over on the news , ’ said mr tyson , a former clerk of works at harrow council , london .
investors in barlow clowes since 1985 , the tysons had orginally put £10,000 into the uk fund and £5,000 in gibraltar-based barlow clowes international ( bci ) .
fate determined that a short while before the businesses failed , they transferred the £10,000 to bci because of the better returns being offered .
in the days that followed , the tysons found that they and 18,000 other investors had been the victims of a financial crash of global proportions .
of the £190million invested in both funds , bci investors faced a shortfall of up to £100million .
after the initial shock and disbelief , the tysons grew angry — at the advisers who convinced them about barlow clowes , at the midland bank manager who gave verbal assurances of its security , at the regulatory authorities responsible for the investment community and at the department of trade and industry which allowed the company to trade .
‘ i felt it was so safe , they were so professional , ’ said mr tyson .
‘ i feel appalled by the way these professional guardians have treated us .
if you were a gambling man it would not affect you , it would just be lost .
but this was not a gamble . ’
like so many investors , mr tyson found himself having to go back to work to ease the financial strain he had hoped to avoid .
ironically , it was the government which he partly blamed for the affair that gave him the chance to return to work after retirement .
a change in the tax rules affecting pensions was shortly followed by a job with the department of environment 's property services agency , a post which carries him through to march and may see him stay until he is 70 .
putting it as politely as he can , mr tyson said the whole affair ‘ encouraged ’ him to return to paid employment .
‘ i had n't planned to work at all . ’
and like all of the other investors , he and his wife were in a quandry .
they wanted to do something but felt powerless .
pursuing legal action would have cost them money they did n't have ( unless it meant selling their house which was not an option ) but doing nothing left them with the feeling that justice was n't being done .
so they compromised and gave £100 to the barlow clowes investors group which was formed last july to represent the investors ' interests and co-ordinate the fight for compensation .
that , says mr tyson , has been their only blessing .
‘ they are dedicated people who clearly know what they are talking about and have guided us through it .
those people are victims , too , but they have certainly kept us together . ’
that aside , the last year has brought little respite from their own , very personal , crisis .
the tysons have yet to see any cash payment from the liquidators who have been winding up bci 's affairs .
what little money has been recovered remains the subject of a legal tussle in the courts which may yet take months to resolve .
they have been told that their claim may only amount to around £11,000 of their £15,000 as capital gains tax is likely to be deducted from the total .
but until they get any money back , the tysons find themselves in the position of the gambler who gambled all and lost .
except that the tysons do n't gamble .
travel : a pilgrimage sans progress elisabeth de stroumillo potters round poitou
by elisabeth de stroumillo
people tend to look vague when you mention poitou .
‘ umm … not a part of france we know … where exactly is it ? ’
inland of la rochelle , you say ; north of cognac and east of limoges .
you sort of pass it without realising , going to the dordogne .
‘ ah yes — cognac .
nice is it ? ’
well , better than that , and one of the best things about it is the fact that so few people , except the french themselves , bother with it .
even for france , the variety to be found is enormous .
my passion is for its numerous romanesque churches , in most cases humbly proportioned but elevated into unique works of art by the richness of their exquisitely-sculpted decoration ; to go to poitou/saintonge and not look at any of its churches would be like going to an african game reserve and ignoring the animals .
for serious drinkers there is the production of cognac to investigate around cognac , plus the chance to sample pineau , the powerful local aperitif made from young wine laced with cognac .
to the north , where poitou borders on the vendee , shapely clumps of trees are almost the only punctuation marks on widespreading marshy landscapes ; to the south it bubbles with little rolling hills .
water is everywhere : canals , streams , small busy rivers with charming names like the boutonne , the mignon and the belle , and big lazy rivers like the sevre niortaise and the charente .
the lower reaches of the sevre niortaise are swollen with the waters that once covered the whole area , until medieval monks started to dig a spider-web of ditches to drain it .
now the marais poitevin is a pleasantly low-profile tourist attraction where you can take canal-boat trips from villages that have hardly changed in the 15-odd years i 've known them : maillezais , with a huge and rather dull ruined abbey , and coulon , where i first ate the delicious local version of moules marinieres called mouclade .
drifting between grassy polders to which farmers have to ferry their cattle in punts , or following leafy twisting lanes marked only by rusty signs proclaiming the ‘ venise verte ’ , you 're in an all-green , mysteriously silent world ; only the occasional fisherman , twitching his rod above the algae-smothered waters , disturbs the stillness .
there is more greenery further south in the deep forest of chize ( with the fine renaissance chateau of dampierre-sur-boutonne at its edge ) ; and more marshes to the west around rochefort and marennes , where those mussels and oysters are raised .
one of the region 's strangest townlets sits on those marshes : brouage .
somnolent now within its low grey walls and stumpy towers , it was once rich on salt , and powerful to boot .
it had a son to be proud of : samuel champlain , founder of quebec , who was born there around 1569 .
a century later , it had an adoptive daughter to weep for : 20-year-old marie mancini , niece of louis xiv 's minister mazarin .
she went there when her romance with the young king was quashed for political reasons .
months later , when marie had departed , louis is said to have paused nostalgically at brouage on his way to paris after marrying the spanish infanta at st jean-de-luz .
as you come back from brouage towards st jean-d'angely — on the d18 via the canalside village of pont-l'abbe-d'arnoult , with a lovely romanesque church faade — a sign at the junction of the d122 points you to the chateau whose improbably perfect lake and gardens stare at you from posters throughout the region : la roche courbon .
its most surprising room , covered from ceiling to floor in 17th-century paintings , should be a salon or library ; instead , a dotty stone bathtub was set into one wall at a later date by a lady called charlotte .
she never used it , having got some of the plumbing details wrong .
wriggling across country on the d216 to port-d'envaux , you come to two more chateaux : 18th-century panloy , flaking romantically away on its hillock overlooking a bend in the charente and , almost next door , the much older , moated crazannes , half-smothered in amazing flamboyant gothic carving .
crossing the autoroute and turning north on the d127 brings you to st jean-d'angely by way of the isolated church of fenioux .
its conically-roofed tower , hugged about by a brood of smaller roofs shaped like candle snuffers , is visible for miles .
st jean-d'angely is a charming little town : there are good shops as well as half-timbered houses along its narrow old streets , one spanned by an ancient bell-tower .
there 's also a renaissance fountain , and an extremely odd conglomeration of church buildings comprising one ancient ruin , one proper church , and the skeleton faade and nave of a rather pompous and unfinished 18th-century abbey .
it makes a conveniently central hub : the marais poitevin village of coulon is 27 miles to the north by the d120 , which inexplicably changes its number at the top of a hill to d115 .
niort is about the same distance by the parallel n150 .
saintes , with gallo-roman remains , a beautiful romanesque abbey and an atmospheric medieval quarter , is 17 miles south of st jean ; 15-odd miles to the north-west is surgeres , all of whose public buildings , including an engagingly asymmetrical church , are within the 16th-century castle walls , scattered among beautiful gardens and parkland — perfect for picnicking .
just under 10 miles south-west of st jean , on the brouage road , st-savinien is at the upper limit of the tidal reaches of the charente .
the villagers ' main hobby seems to be fishing with peculiar , saucer-shaped nets suspended from precariously-perched bankside huts .
one fisherman waxed lyrical about the variety of fish in the river .
‘ even salmon , ’ he assured me , ‘ but of course those are protected and must be thrown back .
which they are … normalement . ’
like almost every other poitevin town and village , st-savinien has a sweet romanesque church ; melle , indeed has three .
but aulnay , just over 10 miles north-east of st jean , is probably the best , its unassuming architecture a perfect frame for the sheer artistry of the carvings round its doors and windows .
biblical motifs recur — some art-experts call them sermons in stone , and their messages would certainly have been clear to the often-illiterate medieval pilgrims trudging to santiago de compostela in spain .
but these themes are always interspersed with more fanciful ones : grimacing masks , weird animals , exuberant abstract patterns .
i think those 10th- and 11th-century sculptors were motivated not just by piety but also by a certain competitive spirit : if a church was finer than the one in the next village , more pilgrims would surely pause there .
today 's attraction-merchants are doing no more to lure 20th-century tourists than their medieval forebears did for pilgrims .
way of the world : farming notes
by auberon waugh
many will take it as a further surrender to common market bureaucracy that an inspectorate will soon be established to regulate the smell of farm manure .
in fact , with the development of deep-litter hen houses and intensive pig culture , some such controls are necessary .
the smell released by a pig or chicken farm is indescribable , and can affect 10 square miles of countryside around .
one may doubt whether modern farming has any useful purpose nowadays when everybody is on a diet .
it mostly seems to involve producing food for animals to eat , whose excrement is then collected to assist the growth of more food for animals .
small children can sometimes be persuaded to eat cow cake in the same way that old people will eat cat food , but the chief result of all this farming was to produce huge food mountains which we could then refuse to give to the third world , or to the socialists of eastern europe , in order to teach them the error of their ways .
however , there is a new plan to turn land over to wind farming .
it involves nothing more than putting up 80-foot masts all over the land .
a 1,500-acre grouse moor will generate enough electricity in this way to power a town of 6,000 people .
the farmer receives a rent of £15,000 a year and is relieved of the need to do any work for it .
all the food we need will be provided by monster underground funguses producing a regular crop of mushrooms without human assistance .
the masts may seem unsightly to those unused to them , but i am sure it is simply a matter of getting accustomed .
cows were thought very unsightly when they were first introduced .
nowadays , we all swoon with pleasure at the sight of a cow .
luxury life awaits private jail inmates
by richard savill
duvets , phonecards , hot showers and video films will greet inmates at britain 's first privately-run prison when it opens on monday .
the wolds , a remand centre at brough , north humberside , is far removed from the insanitary conditions which prevail at many jails .
the 320 inmates will be allowed out of their cells for 14 hours a day with a minimum of six hours education and 13 hours exercise a week .
the £32 million remand prison has 156 single and 72 shared cells , each with its own lavatory and washbasin .
recreation areas have telephones and pool tables .
nail clippers , combs , toothpaste and toothbrushes , razors and washbags are neatly laid out on tables in the cells to await the arrival of inmates , many of whom will not be carrying such items because they may not have expected to be remanded in custody .
‘ the cells are luxurious compared to some of the things we put up with in the army , ’ said one staff member during a press tour of the jail .
the prison has a medical block with 24 beds and a gym with equipment that staff said would be the envy of many council leisure centres .
group 4 remand services ltd , the security firm selected by the home office to manage the wolds in a £5 million-a-year contract , likes to think of its prisoners as customers .
‘ it may seem a little odd for prison staff to be looking at their prisoners as customers , but they are the direct consumers of our service , ’ explained mr stephen twinn , prison director , who spent 23 years in the public sector at various grades of prison governor .
the 60 male warders or ‘ custody officers ’ as they are called , wear a dapper outfit of black blazers , grey trousers , white shirts and grey tie .
women managers have a choice as to whether they wear trousers or a skirt .
name badges are worn by staff .
city comment : there 's spring in the step of the stock market
at least last friday 's post-election stock market surge was not a one-day special offer for the professionals only .
prices have remained high-indeed the ft-se index has risen another 55 points since then — allowing even the most passive of private investors , including unit trust holders , to take advantage of the market .
the 10 p.c. gain since election day is looking increasingly sustainable .
it is not that prospects for earnings are 10 p.c. better that they were in the middle of last week , but it is possible to argue that prospects are that much better than they would have been under a labour government and that the market was discounting such a result .
the ft-se failed to hold its gains yesterday but shortly after opening it was only six points away from last september 's previous record closing level .
wall street has been hitting new peaks this week too , which has given support to the london market ( and even japan 's nikkei index , in a typically erratic period , has gained nearly 800 points while london added its 245 ) but london has real strengths of its own .
the city view is that the fall in corporate earnings has stopped and that next year 's increase could be around 15 p.c .
the market 's price-earnings multiple was 16 last night but it would drop below 14 if that increase in earnings really happens .
the increase will not be matched by dividend rises — too many companies have been paying more than they could afford over the past two years and need to repair their reserves and ratios — but 7 p.c. growth looks reasonable .
the market yield , a historic 4¾ p.c. , could return back above 5 p.c. , therefore giving basic-rate taxpayers a real return with the prospect of real growth too .
not all problems have gone away of course : yesterday 's £6.4 billion public sector borrowing requirement is not much higher than expectations , but it is almost as large as the deficit for the previous 11 months and — with this year 's deficit forecast to be double last year 's — shows why the bank of england so eagerly sold £2 billion or more of gilts on election night and why it needs a regular stream of massive sales .
the change in employment may not always be so favourable as yesterday 's either , but the market is now starting to feel bullish and looking for a ft-se of 3,000 by next year .
part 2 sociology and crime
explaining crime : theories of criminality
most people have their own notions or theories as to what causes criminal behaviour .
for example , lack of discipline in the home , genetic defects , poverty , mixing with the ‘ wrong sort ’ have all been proposed as causes of criminality .
while such notions may all contains some elements of truth , they are by no means complete explanations of criminal behaviour .
this chapter will examine a range of theories which attempt to explain such behaviour .
although the major theoretical explanations are covered in the numerous introductions to the sociology of crime and deviance and to sociology generally , some review of these theories is necessary before embarking upon an examination of specific , substantive examples of criminal behaviour .
as this is not a book on criminological theories , what follows will be a brief overview of a wide range of theories and explanations .
first , a word of warning might be in order .
it would be naive to expect to uncover any ultimate explanation or basic cause for criminal behaviour , given the extensive and diverse behaviour that is encompassed by the term crime .
suppose , for example , that it could be proved that one cause of delinquency was lack of parental supervision .
it might still be necessary to ask why delinquency occurred with one son or daughter but not another .
also , there would be the further question of why the parents had not provided adequate supervision .
perhaps this was because of their poor living conditions which would raise the question of why they were in poor housing .
was this because of governmental housing policy or a poor employment record on the part of the bread-winner of the family ?
clearly , we are getting further and further away from the causes of delinquent behaviour , and it is perhaps wisest to think in terms of causal processes when looking at criminal behaviour .
biological and psychological theories
before examining the major sociological on crime , it is useful to refer to theories from outside of sociology , from other academic disciplines .
thus , we will look initially at biological and psychological theories .
biological theories
biological ( or physiological ) explanations are based on the notion that some individuals are predisposed to criminal behaviour because of their genetic make-up .
the individual criminal is born so ; and this is usually put down to ‘ faulty chromosome patterns ’ , or , more vaguely , to ‘ hereditary traits ’ .
the most famous exponent of this approach was the nineteenth-century italian physician , cesare lombroso .
in his book l'uomo delinquente , lombroso developed a complex description of what he called the ‘ born criminal ’ , who could be recognised by a variety of physical characteristics , in particular facial characteristics — for example large jaws and ears , and high cheek bones .
in the medical faculty at the university of rome there is a gallery of portraits of splendidly ugly delinquents who were used to illustrate lombroso 's theory .
to use his own language :
thus were explained anatomically the enormous jaws , high cheek bones , prominent superciliary arches , solitary lines on the palms , extreme size of the orbits , handle-shaped or sessile ears found in criminals , savages and apes , insensibility of pain , extremely acute sight , tattooing , excessive idleness , love of orgies and the craving for evil for its own sake …
these explanations see the delinquent individual as inherently more prone to criminal behaviour than the non-delinquent .
they have been widely criticised and rejected by sociologists .
lombroso 's work , for example , was based on his examination of people in prison in italy .
this would , necessarily , ignore the fact that many criminals do not go to prison , and that , perhaps , people in prison are not always criminal .
most advocates of biological theories do not express themselves in the same bizarre language and style as lombroso , and such theories of crime are not merely historical relics that died with lombroso .
in a major study of institutionalised delinquents ( delinquents in some form of custody ) in the usa in the 1950s , sheldon and eleanor glueck found that delinquent boys were twice as likely to have a mesomorphic build , a chunky , muscular , compared with non-delinquent boys .
however , the fact that the study was restricted to institutionalised delinquents limits the validity of the association between body build and crime and delinquency .
it may be that tougher-looking delinquents are more liable to be put away than fragile looking ones .
furthermore , it has been found that the association between delinquency on the one hand and height , weight and physique on the other is greatly reduced once social , background factors are taken into account .
for example , lower working-class people are more likely to be mesomorphic as a result of their diet and continual manual labour , and this class grouping is more likely to be found represented in the criminal statistics .
with regard to the links between criminal behaviour and inherited characteristics , there have been a number of theoretical explanations suggesting an association between criminality and particular personality characteristics .
an example of this more sophisticated biological approach is the work of hans eysenck , who has argued in a series of studies , that there is a link between genetically based personality characteristics and criminal behaviour .
he maintains that there is a link between characteristics such as extroversion and criminal behaviour .
an individual 's degree of extroversion or introversion is inherited , determined by his or her genetic make-up .
the link with crime found by eysenck was that when prisoners were tested for extroversion , more extroverts were found than in the general population .
eysenck then argues that extroversion is the inherited basis of criminal behaviour .
extroverts take longer to learn the rules of society , they are more likely to break them , and thus more likely become convicted criminals .
as with lombroso 's work and the gluecks ' study discussed above , by starting with institutionalised criminals , it is assumed that all prisoners are criminals and that most criminals do , in fact , go to prison .
the people who get caught and imprisoned may not be a representative picture of all criminals .
the major problem faced by theories suggesting a link between genetic make-up and criminal behaviour is the difficulty of distinguishing between genetic and environmental effects .
while some genetic influence can not be ruled out , just what is inherited remains very unclear .
psychological theories
these theories share certain similarities with biological explanations .
they stress the link between criminal behaviour and specific personality traits or characteristics .
psychological theories , however , see these characteristics as a result of unusual or abnormal experiences , rather than as inherited .
thus , as with biological theories , crime is seen as pathological ( a disease ) , as something to be looked at from the medical point of view .
however , psychological causes are seen as treatable , whereas biological causes mark the individual for life .
in those cases there is no possible treatment , one is born a criminal .
many psychological theories refer to faulty parent-child relationships , such as abnormal experiences in early childhood having a lasting effect and influence on personality .
studies in this area have indicated that too strict or too lax parental attitudes increase the risk of delinquency ( the work of john bowlby , for example ) ; they have found that if a young child is deprived of close personal relationships with parents or parent figures then ‘ problem behaviour ’ is more common .
it is well established that in the delinquent-prone , home discipline is more liable to be too lax , strict or erratic .
however , it is patently obvious that parents can be a good or bad influence and example for their children , and this fact can hardly be used to explain present patterns of crime .
the majority of offenders do not come from disturbed or broken homes , and many broken homes do not produce delinquents .
of course , this last point does not show that there is no link between parent-child relations and crime and delinquency .
the problem with assessing the influence of parental and family dimensions , such as weak supervision or parental criminality , is the fact that they are closely linked to various aspects of social and economic disadvantage , such as poverty , overcrowding and poor housing .
and it may be that these disadvantages help to cause parental difficulties , and hamper good parenting .
we can hardly do justice to the wide scope of psychological theories here , but there are some basic ideas and assumptions which underlie such theorizing .
these stress the importance of family relationships and upbringing during the early years , and conclude that anti-social , and by implication criminal , behaviour results from faulty personality development .
to summarise , these biological and psychological theories hold that the criminal is a particular type of person , apart from the rest of society and with a special predisposition toward criminal behaviour .
they are based on the idea that criminal behaviour is either inherited or a consequence of unique , individual experiences .
before we look at sociological explanations it might be useful to ask yourself , or to discuss with colleagues , whether you feel that criminals are different ‘ types ’ of person .
while there are , no doubt , predispositions toward criminal behaviour , and clearly certain characteristics are inherited , most sociologists would reject these ‘ individual pathology ’ sort of theories .
they lack convincing supporting evidence .
while some offenders suffer from mental disorders the vast majority do not .
furthermore , if criminals are abnormal then it follows that a large proportion of the population must also be abnormal .
for numerous studies have shown that a high percentage of the population have committed criminal offences , in particular high proportions of juveniles , and it is difficult to believe that they are all different or abnormal .
sociological theories
we said above that sociologists would reject non-sociological explanations of crime .
this is not because such explanations are ‘ wrong ’ , but because they are incomplete or inadequate .
in chapter one , it was stressed that crime can not be considered aside from its social context , that it is dependent on society defining certain actions as criminal , and on the reaction of others to such actions .
chapter nine
‘ i have a very important assignment for you , paula , ’ arlene frampton-cox said .
she inserted a du maurier cigarette into her long tortoiseshell holder and sat back , looking at paula , who was seated in the visitor 's chair on the other side of the desk , long legs crossed elegantly .
paula looked every inch a model these days , arlene thought with a touch of proprietorial pride .
her long hair , shining gold , was swept back and caught at the nape of her neck with a bow , make-up , expertly applied , accentuated the classically beautiful lines of her face , and she wore her well-cut suit with all the panache that was expected of her .
a good suit was a working model 's uniform — paula now bought two each season and wore them with perfectly matching accessories , hat , bag and shoes .
this one was in soft light green with a boxy shaped jacket and narrow skirt and the same green-and-white check material of the little sleeveless blouse had been used to line the jacket and face the wide reveres .
paula 's bag and shoes were patent black leather , her gloves white , and she carried a long walking umbrella neatly furled in its fur-trimmed case .
perfectly groomed from head to toe and with all that assurance , she was ready to take on the world , arlene thought with satisfaction , for she looked on paula as her very own creation .
the raw materials might have been there before — indeed , had n't it been she , arlene , who had spotted them ?
but the transformation of a leggy young filly into a sleekly beautiful racehorse had been her doing .
eighteen months on the model circuit had eliminated all trace of her former somerset accent .
she had listened to arlene 's own voice and set about imitating it for she held her mentor in the highest esteem whilst still being a little afraid of her .
the house of mattli is expanding from couture into ready-to-wear and one of the big bristol stores , taylors , are putting on a show to publicise the fact that they will be stocking the new prêt-è-porter ' , arlene explained .
‘ i have been asked to supply the models and i would like you to be one of them . ’
‘ mattli ! ’
paula repeated , impressed .
the house of mattli was a husband and wife team who were numbered amongst the top ten names in the incorporated society of london fashion designers .
furthermore madame mattli was a frenchwoman , an accident of birth which added to her glamour , for was not paris the fashion capital of the world ?
‘ madame mattli will be coming to bristol herself , ’ arlene continued .
‘ taylors have a certain amount of stock but she will be bringing extra samples from london especially for the show .
i only want the best of my girls on this job .
madame mattli , remember , is used to the best .
we ca n't afford any sloppiness .
i can count on you , paula , i feel sure . ’
‘ oh yes , ’ paula said , brimming with suppressed excitement .
‘ you can count on me ! ’
madame mattli was almost exactly as paula had imagined she would be , a petite perfectly turned out woman with an air of chic that was unmistakably french .
her dark , grey-streaked hair , which she wore in a long bob , had been cut by vidal sassoon and she wore a beautifully tailored black suit relieved only by a little white flounce at the neckline .
in the fitting rooms at taylors she fussed and fretted over her creations like a mother hen and though paula was overawed by the great designer she also liked her on sight .
madame mattli might be a stickler for detail , with a generous helping of the artistic temperament which kept her tight-coiled as a spring and which would explode into frenzy if the smallest detail was not as it should be , but she also had a kind face and deep perceptive eyes .
half way through the day 's programme of shows , while the dressers went off to grab a sandwich and the model girls , who would not dare to eat while they were showing , revived themselves with cups of black coffee , madame mattli took paula to one side .
‘ little one , i would like to speak with you . ’
paula 's stomach turned a somersault .
had she done something wrong ?
‘ i have been watching you work , ’ madame mattli said directly .
her accent reminded paula of louise — perhaps that was why she warmed to her in spite of the fact that she was so awe-inspiring .
‘ you are exactly right for a couture model .
you have all the physical attributes . ’
‘ thank you , ’ paula said faintly .
madame mattli waved a dismissive hand .
‘ do not thank me .
i am not saying this to make your head swell .
on the contrary .
the fact is that i have a vacancy arising for a couture model .
i believe you are exactly what i am looking for .
i would like you to come to london to work for me . ’
over madame mattli 's shoulder paula could see arlene watching her , a tiny smile lifting one corner of her scarlet mouth , and paula knew her well enough by now to know exactly what she was thinking .
she did not want to lose paula , who was one of her best models , but already she was enjoying the reflected glory that came from having personally trained a house model for one of the great london couture houses .
she had known about the vacancy at mattli and hoped that the job might be offered to paula .
it was the seal of approval for her own judgement .
‘ well ? ’
madame mattli demanded .
‘ can i have a little time to think it over ? ’
paula asked boldly .
‘ a little .
but please do not delay too long .
my present house model leaves at the end of the month and there are plenty of girls who would jump at the chance . ’
‘ i 'm sure .
but all the same i could n't make such a move without giving it some thought , ’ paula said grandly .
but inside she was bubbling with excitement .
time to think ?
she did n't need a single second .
the moment madame mattli had offered her the job she had made up her mind .
she was going to take it — of course !
a month later paula , smartly dressed in a new tweed suit with the obligatory matching bag and shoes , and lugging both her modelling case and a brand new cream leather suitcase , took the train to london to begin her new career .
she had booked herself a bed at a ywca hostel for the time being .
it was not quite what she envisaged for herself but it had the advantage of being cheap and it went some way towards satisfying grace , who was convinced that london was a den of iniquity waiting to swallow up her unsuspecting daughter .
from the hostel it was only a short tube ride to south audley street where madame mattli had her showrooms — yet another advantage , paula thought , trying to weigh up the points in favour of the hostel , which she hated on sight .
sharing a small spartan room with two other girls — northerners whose accent paula found almost incomprehensible and with whom she had nothing in common , making breakfast in the communal kitchen , queuing for the bath , adhering to a strict curfew after which time the doors were locked and bolted — none of these were restrictions paula had the slightest intention of enduring for long .
but for now it would have to do .
and at least she was in london , centre of the british fashion industry .
as for the house of mattli , it might have been in a different world to the hostel , with its air of being a cross between a workhouse and a boarding school .
the first time she rang the bell and went in through the front doors of the elegant old house where the showrooms were situated ( mattli had no rear entrance ) paula felt she was stepping into the place of her dreams .
deep carpet covered the floors and the stairs swept up to the showrooms and the warren of workrooms beyond , and though the window drapes and furnishings were ever-so-slightly faded , as if they had seen better days , they were of the finest silks and velvets and every corner was swept , polished and cleaned daily so that no single speck of dust , let alone a cobweb , dared show itself .
the showroom was neither large nor small , decorated in muted shades of aubergine which would not detract from the clothes .
there was a low table and three or four dainty chairs with aubergine velvet seats and gilded spindle legs .
the crystal chandelier was for effect only — lighting that would show off the clothes to their best advantage was brilliant yet discreet , and along one wall were racks holding some of the ready-to-wear garments .
in contrast to this elegant frontage the workrooms beyond were a hive of frenzied activity .
pattern cutters , fitters , sewing hands and their assistants all worked at an incredible speed .
this , paula soon discovered , was the way of the fashion world — a constant frantic rush against the clock , to have collections ready on time or to complete individual couture garments for customers who always considered their order more urgent , more important , than that of anyone else .
paula was amazed by the security arrangements that were necessary to ensure that the new season 's collections remained exclusive — the windows at the rear of the premises were heavily barred and practically the first thing she had to do on commencing her employment was to sign a contract promising that she would not breathe a word about the designs she saw .
on her second day madame mattli took her to vidal sassoon 's salon in grosvenor house so that her hair could be cut in an up-to-the-minute style .
unlike some couturiers madame did not mind if her model girls did not have the same colour hair but she did insist on identical styles .
by the time vidal sassoon had finished with her paula 's long fair locks had been shorn to a sharp geometric shape and she scarcely recognised the reflection that looked back at her from the mirror .
among the rich and famous who had come to the salon to have their hair cut , tinted and set , paula recognised dusty springfield , the pop singer , her eyes big and sooty , her lips pearly pink , and was unable to suppress the thrill of excitement which ran through her .
this was her very first taste of only the best being good enough — and she liked it !
it was paula 's job to show samples , parading slowly up and down in front of the clients as they sat on the elegant spindle-leg chairs taking in every detail of the garments with a critical and practised eye .
sometimes they came alone , sometimes with a man in tow — to foot the bill !
paula guessed .
the appearance of a famous face in the show rooms always caused a stir amongst the girls , who all longed to hook a wealthy husband — and if he had a title , like the aly khan , or was a film star like omar shariff , then so much the better !
not everything that paula had to do was quite so glamorous , however .
in the long hours when there were no customers to show she was expected to lend a hand with some of the unskilled tasks — running errands and making tea , unpicking a seam or a hem , even sewing on a button or a hook and eye when she had been taught the proper way to do it .
paula was not very clever with her needle but she soon learned to be careful so as not to incur the wrath of the seamstress .
there were new tricks of modelling to be learned too — how to remove a coat , sliding it carefully off her shoulders with the sleeves hanging in perfect balance , never for one moment allowing the inside to be on view , for samples were often unlined .
this trick took hours of practice , up and down the landing at the hostel while the other girls looked at her as if she had taken leave of her senses .
although she enjoyed her job paula was lonely .
even the most popular of girls soon discovered that in this highly competitive world where models vied with one another for the most glamorous jobs and the wealthiest and best-looking men there was far more bitchiness than in the provinces — and paula was far from popular .
the other girls disliked her for her outstanding looks and her haughty ways and made no attempt to be friendly on anything but the most superficial level and the pattern cutters and sewing hands hurried home to their families and boyfriends the moment they finished their long day 's work .
paula spent most of her free time alone , window shopping , visiting news theatres , where she sometimes watched the programme of cartoons twice round , and drinking endless cups of espresso coffee in cafés and coffee houses .
her favourite was the coffee shop in fenwicks in bond street for this was the haunt and the meeting place of all those from the world of fashion .
one lunchtime when she had been at the house of mattli for a few months paula went there for her usual coffee and the cottage cheese salad that was her staple diet now that it was so important that she did not add a single half-inch to her wand-slim figure .
she took her tray to the pay desk , opened her bag and felt for her purse .
it was not there .
frantically she rooted round , then checked her pockets without success .
‘ i 'm sorry .
i seem to have lost my purse … ’ she explained .
the girl behind the till stared at her stonily .
paula was going hot and cold by now .
had it been stolen ?
no , she remembered her bag tipping over in the cloakroom at mattli — it must have fallen out then .
but without it she could not pay for her coffee and salad .
‘ having trouble ? ’ a voice beside her asked .
‘ do n't worry .
let me . ’
paula turned gratefully , then gasped with surprise as she recognised the slight figure in black roll-neck sweater and skin tight pants .
‘ i do n't believe it !
gary oliver !
what are you doing here ? ’
‘ the same as you i expect , paula — getting my strength up to face the rest of the day .
let me pay and then we 'll have lunch together and do some catching up — unless you 're meeting someone , of course . ’
‘ no — no , i 'm not . ’
paula picked up her try and moved aside waiting for him , flushed with pleasure at seeing a familiar face .
gary oliver was a designer , young and very talented .
she had met him back home in the west country when he had come to supervise a show put on by one of the big ready-to-wear labels , carnega , for whom he worked as a junior member of the design team .
for a whole week they had worked closely together , sharing flasks of coffee and packets of cigarettes and paula had grown to like the pixieish little man who by his very nature offered her no challenge — and no threat .
gary should have been a girl , she had thought , for he was half a head smaller than she was with fair curling hair , baby-blue eyes and long thick lashes that were the envy of every woman who met him .
‘ shall we sit over there in the corner ? ’
gary suggested .
he led the way , his slim hips in the tight fitting pants snaking gracefully between the tables .
they unloaded their trays on to a table .
‘ what are you doing in london then , paula ?
apart from mislaying your purse , i mean . ’
he grinned at her impishly .
she told him .
‘ and what about you ?
are n't you with carnega any more ? ’
he shook his head .
dimples played in his cheeks .
‘ no — now i 'm with the house of oliver . ’
‘ the house of oliver … ?
oh ! ’ she squealed as light dawned .
‘ your own house ?
you 've set up as a designer in your own right , gary ! ’
‘ yep .
in a small way at the moment , of course , but things are happening .
i came into a bit of money when my grandmother died and i decided to put it to good use . ’
‘ is n't it a bit of a risk ? ’
paula asked .
he shrugged his narrow shoulders .
‘ perhaps .
but i wanted to work for myself .
designing clothes for carnega was all very well and i made a good living at it i wo n't deny but i wanted to be free to do my own thing — and to have my own name on the labels .
i have quite a few contacts — people who knew me when i was designing for carnega — and they have been very encouraging .
so i have decided to move to london and open a showroom .
in fact i have just been looking at a place in south audley street , not far from mattli .
if it works out we shall practically be neighbours , paula . ’
‘ what a small world !
i had no idea , ’ paula said , surprised she had not already heard the news .
usually the slightest whisper travelled like jungle drums through the world of fashion .
until now gary had been an out-of-town designer , of course .
but if he was moving to london his new fashion house would soon be a talking point .
‘ we must keep in touch , ’ gary said as he finished his cheese roll .
‘ promise you 'll look in and say hello when you have time . ’
‘ i will .
apart from anything else i owe you a coffee . ’
‘ true .
i do n't suppose i could persuade you to work for me in return ?
i 'm looking for a couple of good models .
though i do n't suppose i could afford to pay you as well as mattli does — yet .
maybe one day … ’
paula laughed .
‘ i do n't earn that much !
by the time i 've paid for my room at the ywca and bought all the make-up and clothes i need there never seems to be anything left over .
i 'm looking for a rich husband to take me away from it all . ’
‘ and i 'm sure one day you 'll find him .
in the meantime , do n't forget your friends , eh paula ? ’
‘ i wo n't , ’ she promised , glancing at her watch .
‘ oh hell , i shall have to go . ’
‘ me too .
but it was great to see you again , paula . ’
they walked back to south audley street together , weaving their way through the lunchtime crowds on the pavements , the tall , striking girl and the young man whose pixieish looks belied his twenty-six years .
outside the front entrance of the house of mattli paula turned to give him a quick impulsive hug .
‘ thanks for the lunch , gary .
and good luck with your new venture ! ’
she held up her fingers , tightly crossed for him .
he grinned .
‘ i 'll need it .
do n't forget to come and see me , will you ?
i shall be expecting you . ’
‘ i wo n't forget .
'bye for now ! ’ she called , and ran in through the imposing front door .
madame mattli was furious .
in all the time she had been with her paula had never seen her so angry .
‘ i hear you have been seen going into the house of oliver , ’ she said , her immaculately painted lips tight with fury .
beside her monsieur mattli , a small greek-looking man , some ten years her senior , was also quivering with indignation .
‘ not once but several times , ’ he added .
it was so unusual for him to contribute anything to the conversation that paula glanced at him in surprise .
though he was always in evidence it was invariably madame who did all the talking , giving orders , fussing around clients , so that paula was never quite certain what his role was .
‘ gary oliver is a friend , ’ she said defensively .
madame mattli snorted angrily .
‘ i do not pay you to have friends in rival fashion houses . ’
‘ he 's not a rival … ’
paula broke off .
it seemed ridiculous that a newcomer like gary could be any threat to a well-established house like mattli .
but in the cut-throat world of fashion up and coming designers were to be feared — and already gary 's reputation was growing .
‘ you know that we insist on complete loyalty , ’ madame mattli continued .
‘ the security of our designs is paramount .
oh paula , how could you ! ’
‘ but i would never mention anything i have seen here ! ’
paula protested .
madame snorted again .
‘ how can i be sure of that ?
even if you do not intend to be disloyal there is always the risk that you might be careless .
pillow talk is the most dangerous . ’
‘ pillow talk ! ’
paula repeated , stunned .
close though her friendship with gary had become she had never once breathed a word to him about the new collections she saw taking shape at mattli — and as for ‘ pillow talk ’ the notion was absurd .
there was nothing like that between them and never would be .
gary was not interested in girls .
surely that must be obvious to everyone who met him .
‘ you must stop visiting him , ’ madame said firmly .
‘ either i have your word on it or i am afraid you can no longer remain in my employ .
i want you to promise me here and now that you will not see gary oliver again . ’
paula was trembling .
her job with the house of mattli was her life .
but to allow herself to be dictated to in this way when she knew she had done nothing wrong was tantamount to admitting guilt .
and she could n't bear the thought of being sucked back into the ebb tide of loneliness again either .
with gary she enjoyed a relationship she had never experienced with anyone else — the easy-going friendship of a male who made no demands whatever on her — and it meant more to her than she had realised .
‘ i have never betrayed any confidence and i never will .
but you ca n't expect me to cut myself off from my friends , ’ she said .
‘ i am afraid i do expect it , paula , in this case . ’
‘ i ca n't promise not to see gary again . ’
‘ very well . ’
there was a hint of sadness now in madame 's eyes but her mouth was set and determined .
‘ i shall be sorry to lose you , paula .
you are a good model and you suited me very well .
but you leave me no choice .
please do not bother to come in again .
i shall contact the agency for a replacement immediately .
and i warn you , if any of my designs or anything like them turn up in the showroom at the house of oliver i shall sue — and win the sort of damages that will put your little friend out of business for good .
do i make myself clear ? ’
paula was still afraid of madame mattli — and she was also close to tears .
but she was determined madame should not be aware of either .
‘ yes , madame .
i 'm sorry to leave you , but i assure you you need not worry on that score . ’
the showrooms of the house of oliver were smaller and less grand than those at the house of mattli but the décor was newer and fresher , pale grey drapes , ultra modern black furniture and a great deal of gleaming stainless steel .
gary was in the workroom when paula arrived , pinning a length of vibrant pink chiffon sarong-style around one of his models .
his mouth was full of pins .
‘ what are you doing here ? ’ he asked without moving his lips .
paula perched herself against the cutting table trying to look nonchalant .
‘ i 've left mattli , ’ she said .
gary stared at her for a moment , pins spewing from his mouth and catching on the front of his black jersey .
then he unpinned the length of chiffon and let it fall to the floor .
the model stood motionless , clad in nothing but her bra and stockings , waiting for his instructions .
‘ we 'll leave this for now , claudia ’ , he said .
‘ see if you can rustle up a cup of tea for paula and me , please . ’
the girl pulled on her wrap and moved to the door looking back over her shoulder as she went and paula was aware of the hostility in her gaze .
why was it all women hated her so , even when they did n't know her ?
she shrugged .
oh well , she should be used to it by now …
gary got up , took paula by the arm and led her over to the low sofa .
‘ what 's all this about , lovey ?
you ca n't have left mattli . ’
‘ i have . ’
paula related what had happened and saw gary turn pale .
‘ oh lord !
you mean she thinks you 've been spying for me !
if she sues i 'll be ruined .
even worse , someone of her stature could make a hell of a lot of trouble for me , even if she does n't . ’
‘ but gary — i have n't been spying for you !
i have n't even mentioned a single detail of the mattli collection . ’
‘ you know that and so do i. but suppose i 've done something similar ?
it happens every season — by sheer chance and law of averages some of the ideas are bound to come up .
there are always accusations of piracy and copy-catting , though they ca n't usually be substantiated .
but if she can prove that you and i … ’
‘ that 's nonsense !
we have n't done anything wrong . ’
gary ran a distracted hand through his mop of fair hair .
‘ you 're going to have to describe the mattli collection to me .
every detail . ’
‘ gary ! ’ she objected , shocked .
‘ you 're an original .
you ca n't steal their ideas ! ’
‘ no , idiot — not so that i can steal them .
so that i can go through my designs and make quite certain that there is not one collar , not one cuff detail , not the slightest influence that they could accuse me of copying from them .
oh jesus christ ! — suppose there 's something major ?
my peg top evening gown — my beautiful cerise lace — i could end up having to rethink the whole collection ! ’
‘ for goodness sake stop panicking ! ’
paula said , though she could feel the seeds of panic herself .
‘ i 'm sure there 's nothing to worry about . ’
‘ i only hope you 're right ! ’ he said in anguished tones .
the model came in with the cups of tea , still glowering darkly at paula from beneath her fringe of false eyelashes .
it was clear she was blaming paula bitterly for the interrupted afternoon and her boss 's drastic change of mood .
‘ that girl is a dog ! ’
paula said when they were alone again .
‘ i 'm sure she ca n't do justice to your designs .
and with a miserable face like hers i 'm surprised you ever get any work done at all . ’
gary looked crestfallen .
‘ she 's the best i could get … ’
‘ oh what rubbish ! ’
paula said roundly .
‘ anyway , you 've got me now so you can get rid of her . ’
‘ what do you mean ? ’
gary asked .
he looked like a worried small boy .
‘ i told you — i 've left mattli .
i 'll come and work for you . ’
‘ oh paula ! ’
gary 's expression became even more anxious .
‘ you know i 'd give my right arm to have someone as good as you to model for me !
but i told you before — i could n't afford to pay you what you 're worth .
well , not for ages , anyway .
it 's going to be a long struggle getting established and until i am i do n't see how … ’
paula smiled .
for the first time she felt the stirrings of something like power .
it was not unlike the feeling she experienced when men looked at her and wanted her though she knew it could not be that for there was nothing sexual between her and gary and never would be .
but it was just as exciting , nevertheless .
it made her feel strong , invincible almost , and just a tiny bit as if she had drunk too much wine .
her smile spread .
we beat southwards all that first day , slicing through a glittering sea , and propelled by an apparently changeless south-easterly trade wind .
we hardly saw the crowninshield twins .
they briefly appeared on deck for lunch ; a meal which rickie hardly touched , while robin-anne , despite her apparent frailty , attacked the sandwiches and salad with the savagery of a starving bear .
afterwards , incongruously dressed in a raincoat , she went to the bows and stared briefly down at the mesmerising onrush of sea where it split and foamed at wavebreaker 's cutwater .
she did not stay there long , but retreated from the fierce sun to the stern-cabin that she would be sharing with ellen .
the contrast between the two american girls was almost painful ; ellen was so healthy and strong , while the waif-like robin-anne was pathetically wan and listless .
‘ what do you think of her ? ’
i asked ellen that afternoon .
ellen gave me an amused glance .
‘ little orphan annie ?
it 's hard to believe she 's about to be worth six million dollars .
still , she 's got precious little else going for her . ’
i smiled at the severity of ellen 's judgment .
‘ is she that bad ? ’
‘ she has a distressingly simple mind , with only room for a single idea at any one time .
presently that idea is cocaine , and nothing but cocaine .
she has an obsession with the drug that verges on monomania .
she tells me she needs to understand it if she 's going to defeat it . ’
‘ do n't you approve of that ? ’
‘ i think she 'd do better to understand herself , ’ ellen said tartly .
‘ she allowed a man to persuade her into taking the drug , so she can only blame herself for her predicament .
she 'd find it more useful to understand her own character short­comings than to take an elementary course in drug chemistry . ’
‘ what do you make of rickie ? ’
i asked .
‘ he 's precisely what anyone would expect of a drop-out phys ed basketball-playing retard , ’ ellen said scornfully , ‘ by which i mean that he 's a jock with the brains of a dung beetle .
he reminds me of your neanderthal friend , the maggot , except rickie is a great deal more handsome . ’
‘ is he ? ’
she laughed at the suspicion of jealousy in my voice .
‘ yes , nicholas , he is .
but he 's not cute . ’
at supper , as at lunch , robin-anne ate with the appetite of a horse , though her brother hardly touched his chicken and pasta salad .
‘ do n't you like pasta ? ’
ellen , who was perversely proud of her skills in the salad department , asked rickie with just a touch of asperity .
‘ it 's great .
really awesome . ’
rickie lit a cigarette .
‘ i just guess i 'm not hungry . ’
robin-anne reached over and tipped her brother 's food on to her own plate .
‘ kind of starving , ’ she justified her theft , then poured herself some diet soda .
for once we were carrying neither wine nor spirits on wavebreaker , for jackson chatterton 's drug clinic had utterly forbidden us to offer the twins any alcohol , saying that any mood-altering drug could hamper the success of a detoxification programme .
we were thus officially a dry boat , though i had hidden some irish whiskey in the engine room , and i was sure that ellen would have similarly salted away some vodka .
it seemed that ellen and i were not the only ones to take such a precaution , for late that night jackson chatterton lumbered on deck with a bottle in one huge hand .
‘ bourbon , ’ he explained laconically .
‘ want some ? ’
‘ i thought you 'd never ask . ’
he chuckled , produced two cardboard cups , and poured me a generous slug of the whiskey .
we were alone on deck , though not the only ones awake for i could hear rickie and ellen 's voices coming from the open skylight of the main saloon .
i hoped thessy was fast asleep for he would be taking the morning watch .
‘ cheers , ’ i said .
chatterton raised his cardboard cup in silent acknowledgement , then stared ahead to where a great beam swept around the sky .
‘ a lighthouse ? ’ he asked in a voice which suggested that a prudent man avoided such things .
i nodded .
‘ it 's called the hole in the wall .
once we 're past it we can turn out to the open ocean .
things will be a bit livelier then . ’
‘ livelier ? ’
‘ we 'll have a bit more sea , kick up some spray . ’
i had spoken enthusiastically , but jackson chatterton seemed unmoved by the prospect .
‘ what are your plans ? ’ he asked me .
i had nothing particular planned , merely an idea that it might be interesting to thrash our way out into the open ocean , though , mindful of the danger of tropical storms , i had no intention of going too far from the safe shelter of a bahamian hurricane hole .
but i fancied feeling the long hard pressure of ocean waves against our hull and , though we were short-handed , i reckoned that a few days out of sight of land would shake us all down quickly .
i explained all that to chatterton , but stressed that we would run for cover at the first sign of trouble .
he must have assumed that i meant trouble from the twins , for he suddenly became surprisingly loquacious .
‘ they wo n't give you any grief in the next few days , ’ he said .
‘ now that they ca n't get hold of cocaine they 'll just crash out . ’
i grimaced .
‘ does that mean they 'll be seeing green monkeys and blue snakes up the rigging ? ’
chatterton poured himself more bourbon , then put the bottle within my reach on the binnacle shelf .
‘ coming off cocaine is n't like that .
at first they 'll just want to do nothing but eat and sleep .
it 's the opposite of a cocaine high , you see . ’
he paused .
‘ the difficult bit starts two or three days later .
that 's when the real hell begins . ’
‘ for all of us ? ’
‘ it wo n't be easy , ‘ he said grimly , and i was suddenly rather glad to have the taciturn chatterton aboard .
the big man had obviously come on deck to warn me what to expect from the twins , and for that i was grateful .
‘ i noticed that rickie was n't eating today , ’ i said , ‘ but robin-anne was ? ’
chatterton nodded .
‘ rickie may have stopped his cocaine a day or two ago , which means he 's probably already over the crash period .
i promise you one thing ; he 's brought none of it on board .
i searched him and his luggage , and he was clean . ’
the big man thought for a few seconds , then laughed .
‘ he 'd better be clean !
that turkey has got one chance of avoiding jail , just one , and that chance is by proving to the judge that he 's cleaned up his act .
and if he does n't do that , then the man will send rickie 's plump young ass down to the gang-rape squad in the county jail . ’
chatterton did not sound unduly worried at that prospect .
‘ can we be sure robin-anne did n't bring any of the drug aboard ? ’
i asked .
‘ she wo n't have done that , ’ chatterton said with conviction .
‘ that girl is serious about giving it up , real serious , heavy serious !
that girl is really trying !
she studies the drug , you know ?
like it was her enemy . ’
chatterton had spoken with genuine admiration .
i glanced up at the sails , down at the compass , then ahead to where the lighthouse loom arced powerfully through the night .
‘ so what are the twins , chances ? ’
‘ depends on their will power , 'cause nothing else will do it for them .
there ai n't no pill to get you off the powder , mr breakspear , only will power .
and let me tell you , coming off coke is the hardest damn thing in the world , and you 're real lucky if you have a rich daddy who pays for people to hold your hand while you go through the hell of it .
the twins ’ daddy has paid for you and me , mr breakspear , and for everyone else on board this boat , but even with all that money and all this boat , we still might not succeed with them . ’
‘ it 's that hard ? ’
‘ it is that hard , ’ he said ominously , and i thought of john maggovertski 's sadness for a pretty girl who had whored herself to pay for the white powder .
‘ and it 's even harder , ’ jackson chatterton 's voice was suddenly sinister , ‘ for a poor person who has no one to help them . ’
i stared at jackson chatterton , and at last sensed the drama that lay behind his big calm presence .
‘ why did you leave the army , mr chatterton ? ’
i asked after a long pause .
‘ i guess you can guess , ’ he said .
i guessed , but did not make him confirm my guess .
instead i
asked whether the american army had helped him to kick his drug habit .
‘ sure they tried , they tried real hard , but back then i did n't
want to be helped . ’
‘ but you still got off cocaine ?
on your own ? ’
‘ eventually . ’
the light inside the binnacle glossed his black
face with a sheen of red , sparking his eyes like fire .
he was not looking at me , but staring doggedly ahead into the turning white light of the hole in the wall .
‘ and i had to lose a good , good woman before i came to my senses .
but i did kick the drug , mr breakspear , and it was probably the hardest damned thing i ever did in all my life .
but once i 'd done it , i swore i 'd help others do it . ’
‘ even the very rich ? ’
i asked provocatively .
‘ the rich trash pay the bills , mr breakspear , which lets me give my spare time away to the poor trash . ’
i looked at the tough , impressive face .
‘ are the twins trash ? ’
he paused before replying , then gave the smallest shake of his head .
‘ she 's ok , but him ? ’
this time the pause was almost eloquent , then he gave a richly contagious laugh .
‘ i 'd have liked to have had rickie crowninshield in my platoon for just five minutes . ’
i laughed too .
‘ good to have you aboard . ’
‘ it ai n't bad being aboard , ’ he said , and held out his hand and , not before time , we shook .
by midnight i was alone on deck , and happy to be alone .
i like sailing alone at night .
i like to watch the phosphorescence curling away from the hull and i like to watch the brilliant specks of light fade in the black deep water far in the ship 's wake .
i like to be alone under the careless profusion of the stars , and alone on a moon-glossed sea .
i like the sounds of a boat sailing at night .
the sounds are the same as those of daylight , yet somehow the night magnifies and sharpens the creak of a yielding block , the sigh of air over a shroud , the stretching of a sail , the hiss of water sliding sleek against the hull , the curl of a quarter-wave falling away , and the thump as a wave strikes the cutwater to be sheared into two bright slices of whiteness .
i like the purposefulness of a boat at night as it slits a path across an empty planet .
i like the secretiveness of a boat in the blackness , when the only thing to dislike is the prospect of dawn , which seems like a betrayal because , at night , in a boat under sail , it is easy to feel very close to god — for eternity is all around .
i tacked the ship shortly after midnight , doing the job by myself and enjoying the work .
ellen was still awake , talking in the stateroom with rickie , but everyone else seemed asleep .
i wished that ellen and rickie would go to their beds , for the soft mutter of their voices was an intrusion on the dark and star-studded infinity through which i steered wavebreaker .
the school framework
a model to link personality characteristics to a preference for science
john head
introduction
in recent years there has been a steady accumulation of evidence that personality and allied affective factors play a crucial role in determining subject choice and student success .
unfortunately , this evidence has tended to be fragmentary , a collection of separate , discrete pieces of information lacking a synthesizing theory to provide cohesion and predictive power .
the few models which have been developed to date may have been correct as far as they go but are clearly incomplete .
for example roe ( 1952 ) , eiduson ( 1962 ) and mcclelland ( 1962 ) suggested that male scientists often experienced a lonely childhood , perhaps suffering social isolation through illness or family circumstances , so that they developed a strong interest in their surrounding material world and a below average interest in other people and relationships .
maslow ( 1966 ) and hudson ( 1966 and 1968 ) saw science as providing an emotionally undemanding activity appealing to boys moving from the calm of latency to the turbulence of adolescence .
even if these descriptions are valid they still leave open a number of questions , particularly why the same mechanisms do not operate with girls .
arising from the evidence in the literature and from our empirical studies at chelsea college it is now possible to offer a model which is compatible with all the evidence and which also has considerable predictive potential .
what we know about persons choosing science
the evidence for an association between personality characteristics and an interest in science has been more fully reviewed by head ( 1979 ) .
we need now only take note of the most salient features .
the most obvious one is that of sex differences .
the predominance of males , particularly in the physical sciences and engineering , throughout the western world can no longer be satisfactorily attributed to cognitive differences , which are too small , nor to institutional factors .
equal opportunity in education and employment has not made science any more popular with women .
furthermore , the characteristics of those students who do opt for science show clear sex differences .
male scientists , both science students and mature , professional scientists , tend to be emotionally reticent , disliking overt emotional expression in others and themselves , and depending upon their partners in personal relationships to take the emotional initiatives .
they will also tend to be authoritarian , conservative and controlled in their thinking .
these differences can be seen quite early on ; we have found boys aged 14 years who were opting for science to be significantly more authoritarian than their peers .
girls choosing science are not particularly emotionally reticent or rigid in their thinking , although they do seem to have low self-esteem in terms of being socially and sexually attractive .
we also know that at about the age of 13 a very high proportion of boys are attracted to science and scientific careers .
thereafter , there is a steady decline of interest in science and this disillusionment extends right through the secondary-school years and into the undergraduate period .
in contrast , only a minority of girls express an interest in science at any age but there is no obvious swing from science in the middle and late teens .
some further evidence has come from our use of sentence completion tests with secondary-school pupils as part of our research programme at chelsea .
analysis of these responses provides further information on sex differences and between those opting for different subjects .
for example , girls at the age of 12 and 14 years seem to take a more mature attitude to personal relationships , seeing their complexity and reciprocal nature , while boys are more exploitative .
in relation to the sentence stem ‘ a girl and her mother … ’ , girls often produce responses like ‘ often go through a bad patch for a year but once they learn to understand each other , become the best of friends ’ or ‘ can help each other with their problems ’ .
similar questions , when asked of boys , tend to produce banal responses or exploitative ones , for example the parent is seen as the source of money .
in contrast , boys seem to have a firmer self-identity and a clearer ambition showing more insight in response to sentence stems such as ‘ my main problem is … ’ and ‘ he/she felt proud that … ’ .
such findings give us some clues about the characteristics of boys and girls of these ages .
if we compare boys of 14 years of age who opt for science with other boys , we find that the former have very cut-and-dried views on many issues .
for example , they take the view that ‘ criminals should be severely punished ’ or that ‘ anyone who is unpopular deserves his fate ’ .
to the sentence stem ‘ when a child will not join in group activities … ’ , these boys gave responses like ‘ he is selfish ’ , ‘ he must be stupid ’ , ‘ he deserves to be unpopular ’ .
in contrast , other boys and most girls pondered the possible causes and ways of integrating the child into the group .
the science boys seemed to possess few doubts or uncertainties , they offered clear-cut answers .
it was this evidence which suggested the possible model for subject choice in terms of ego-identity achievement .
ego-identity in adolescence
this model was originally postulated by erikson ( 1965 ) and then developed by marcia ( 1966 and 1976 ) .
erikson suggests that at different phases of life an individual faces a particular psycho-social problem which needs to be resolved before moving on to the next phase .
for adolescents the acquisition of a clear ego-identity is the crucial task .
at the beginning of adolescence , the individual is a within the family and the school .
by the end of adolescence he or she needs to make choices about career , life-style , personal relationships and ideologies .
the ego-identity of that person is shaped by these choices .
erikson does not suggest that the development of an ego-identity is a once-and-for-all issue .
some problems about identity arise with the young child in the context of home and school , and others occur in later life , for example on retirement .
nevertheless , adolescence is the time when ego-identity development inevitably dominates the personal development of the individual for a while .
the adolescent does not , however , need to achieve a clear ego-identity on all topics at one time .
he or she may have a clear identity in respect to his or her career but still be unresolved in regard to personal relationships and ideology .
in this article we are concerned with ego-identity achievement in respect to career .
marcia has put more detail onto the erikson model and suggests that in going from the initial ego-diffusion condition to that of having achieved ego-identity , two processes are involved : crisis and commitment .
crisis in this context describes a period of intensive self-examination in which one 's beliefs and values are re-examined .
commitment means that the individual has acquired clear and firm beliefs both about himself or herself and the world .
figure 16.1 indicates a number of possible routes to ego-identity achievements .
a person may undergo crisis and commitment simultaneously and progress by route a. an alternative is to undergo a period of considerable self-doubt and self-examination in which all one 's beliefs tend to be very fluid , a period known as moratorium , before acquiring beliefs for oneself and ego-identity is achieved ( route b ) .
a further possibility is that the individual may , at least for a time , hold onto beliefs and values taken without question from others , for example parents , teachers , peers .
this condition is known as foreclosure .
eventually these persons might have to face up to period of crisis , of self-examination , and so achieve ego-identity by route c. however , foreclosure does offer an escape route and an individual might postpone indefinitely any real self-examination by clinging rigidly to his or her beliefs and values ( route d ) .
ego-identity and choosing science
we can now make the link between this model of adolescent development and subject choice in schools .
for boys at the foreclosure stage , science is likely to be appealing .
the physical sciences in particular , offer a conventional career choice which is likely to win approval from parents , teachers and peers .
they will tend to regard the overt expression of emotions , including much such expression in the arts , as being soft and feminine .
science , with its masculine image , makes little emotional demand on an individual and seems to offer clear , precise answers to problems .
opting for science will permit and possibly reinforce emotional reticence .
for a girl at the foreclosure stage the situation is very different .
there is evidence that girls tend to be socialized into adult roles more through their potential of becoming a mother and housewife than through their career ( douvan and adelson , 1966 ) .
furthermore , these girls will tend to go into a career with a feminine image , one which already attracts many girls .
consequently , very few girls at the foreclosure stage will enter science unless they receive considerable encouragement and a model to do so from their parents and their school .
neither boys nor girls at the moratorium stage are likely to be attracted to the science that is usually presented in our schools .
they are at a stage when they are likely to be concerned with a variety of complex issues ; the meaning of life , the existence of god , ideologies , their emerging sexuality , their future career and life-style — too often science is seen as being purely instrumental with nothing to contribute to these debates .
science , somehow , seems to be scarcely relevant to the most important issues in our life .
a proportion of both boys and girls at ego-identity achievement stage will choose science .
in fact , most girls entering science are probably at this stage as they will need some self-examination and sense of commitment to make this unconventional choice .
however , only a minority of adolescents will have reached the ego-identity achievement stage at the age when most pupils have to make crucial decisions about subject choice at school .
this model seems to explain our observations .
a large number of boys , particularly at the foreclosure stage , are initially attracted to science but there is a drift away throughout later adolescence as they undergo some crisis .
the preponderance of boys at the foreclosure stage will yield the rigid , authoritarian attitudes often associated with scientists .
the few girls who enter science will not usually show these foreclosure characteristics .
effects of curriculum changes
the real use of this model linking personality development to subject choice is that it allows us to make predictions about how pupils might react to changes in school science curriculum and school organization .
we can consider three possible changes :
1
delaying subject choice : britain is unusual in asking pupils to make crucial choices about subject options in the 13–16 age range .
these decisions can only be reversed with great difficulty .
what effect would delaying the choice make ?
in the development through the years of adolescence the number of foreclosure pupils will diminish , hence the recruitment of boys into science would be cut .
more boys and girls will have reached the ego-identity achievement stage and a proportion of these will go into science .
overall there would be a reduction in the number of students choosing science , but those who do so choose will be more likely to stay happily in the subject and to possess more flexible minds .
the quantitative loss would be met by a qualitative improvement .
2
giving science a more feminine image : it is sometimes argued that science textbooks are sexist in showing illustrations of boys , rather than girls , doing practical work in the laboratory , and so forth .
what effect would a deliberate attempt to change this image have ?
it might make it easier for girls at the foreclosure stage to accept science so recruitment might increase .
some of these girls might , however , drift away again when they reach their crisis period .
unless the change in image was immense , boys would probably not be affected , science would still be an obvious , acceptable choice for a boy .
overall there would be some increase in the recruitment of girls , but no qualitative improvement .
3
emphasizing the applications and relevance of science : to obtain a major qualitative improvement to recruitment in science with more girls and with students possessing imaginative , flexible minds it would be necessary to make science appealing to boys and girls at the moratorium stage .
in that event science must be seen to be relevant to the issues which concern them .
the probable implication is that science would need to be presented in the context of the needs of society and individuals .
probably a case-study approach involving the application of science , and the interaction with other disciplines , would be needed .
our knowledge about the girls ' concern with personal relationships suggests that the introduction of some elements of the social sciences into the case studies might prove attractive .
is it possible to change school science in this fashion and still preserve the essential character of science itself ?
clearly there would need to be some drastic pruning of content .
perhaps science teachers should not attempt to cover their subjects so comprehensively .
a history teacher is content to cover the history of one country or continent over a few decades .
perhaps we must make similar choices .
it is interesting to notice that the association for science education ( 1979 ) policy statement in britain and the proposals on school physics coming from the institute for science education ( ipn ) in kiel are advocating such changes .
the difference is that we are now offering a formal psychological model to suggest that if we want to reduce the current encapsulation of science , if we want to recruit a different sort of student , then certain curriculum changes are needed .
girl friendly science and the girl friendly school
judith whyte
approximately three times as many boys as girls take o level physics and approximately four times as many take cse physics .
over 90 per cent of entries in all technical subjects are from boys .
this means that schoolgirls are ineligible for a wide range of courses in further and higher education and for entry to occupations requiring a scientific or technical base .
female exclusion from science and technology , even if it is apparently by girls ' own choice , also means that as citizens their ability to understand and control their environment is limited .
nevertheless , most schools consider they are already providing equal opportunities by neutral treatment of the two sexes ( bloomfield , 1984 ) .
in effect , ignoring the effects of gender in this way merely reinforces stereotyping because it does nothing to challenge the definition of certain aspects of the curriculum as masculine or feminine .
girls into science and technology ( gist ) was the first major schools-based project addressing problems of sex stereotyping at school , and was an example of ‘ action research ’ in education ; the project simultaneously took action to improve girls ' achievement in science and technology and investigated the reasons for their under-achievement .
the project team collaborated with teachers in eight co-educational comprehensive schools in the greater manchester area to devise and implement intervention strategies designed to improve girls ' attitudes to the physical sciences and technical subjects .
two other schools were involved as controls where attitude testing but no interventions took place . …
the approach was collaborative : teachers were invited to work with the team as equal partners in the attempts both to investigate and find solutions to the gist problem .
however , very few of the teachers even recognized the issue as one of professional concern at the start of the project , and most of the first two years was spent in establishing the educational importance of the issue and working towards the development of feasible intervention strategies .
the project and its outcomes have been fully described elsewhere ( smail et al . ,
1982 ; kelly , whyte and smail , 1984 ; whyte in press ) .
gist had more success in altering children 's attitudes than their subject choices , suggesting that it is easier to change attitudes and beliefs than actual behaviour .
pupils in action schools became markedly less stereotyped than pupils in control schools .
they also had slightly more positive attitudes towards science and scientists and were less likely to define them as exclusively masculine .
despite some evidence of change in teachers ' attitudes and behaviour , they themselves were reluctant to admit that the project had influenced them .
according to an evaluation report this may reflect an unwillingness to admit that in the past schools have been sex biased ( payne , cuff and hustler , 1984 ) .
the gist hypothesis was that female under-achievement in science and technology is at least partly socially constructed by the school , an hypothesis based on research evidence as well as critical feminist analysis ( see , for example , kelly , 1981 ) .
during the project there was a shift away from locating the issue as one of girls ' motivation towards attempts to change the nature of school science .
one of the main gains from the gist project has been the clarification of what is meant by a ‘ girl friendly ’ , science , that is a science which will appeal equally to the interests and concerns of girls as well as boys . …
making science more girl friendly
several interventions were designed to make science more girl friendly .
schools and teachers tried curriculum development to build on girls ' science interests , changing patterns of classroom interaction , single sex groups and classes .
the largest scale intervention was the vista programme , which consisted of women scientists and technologists visiting schools to talk to children about an aspect of their jobs already being covered in the school science syllabus .
vista made science more girl friendly in two ways : both boys and girls were offered an attractive image of a competent woman scientist , and talks concentrated on social and industrial applications of science , an element too often missing from science at school .
one school was so impressed by the children 's positive reactions that they completely revamped the science work in the first two years to include more social and human applications of science .
the survey of children 's attitudes helped here : research such as ormerod 's ( 1971 ; ormerod and duckworth , 1975 ) had shown that girls were interested in the social implications of science , but did not tell teachers what the desirable teaching approach might be in practice .
would science in the home be a starter ?
a question from our survey asked children whether they would like to know more about how a vacuum cleaner works ; hardly anyone did , and girls were even less curious than boys .
this told us that any simplistic assumptions about featuring ‘ female ’ domestic interests in science would probably meet with failure .
the rest of the questionnaire about science curiosity showed that all the children were enthusiastic about learning science , and that girls were keen to know more about nature , the environment and medical science .
over 50 per cent , and in some cases over 60 per cent said they would like to learn about the human heart , germs and illnesses , how our muscles work , what food is good for you , life in the sea , what makes a rainbow appear and how a record is made .
it was helpful that these topics also interested boys .
at present the science curriculum is structured around physical science interests , on which boys are keener ( how motor cars work , atoms and molecules ) ; we were able to recommend that teaching build on the overlapping interests of the two sexes , because girls as well as boys want to know more about human biology and spectacular features of the environment ( animals in the jungle , volcanoes and earthquakes , acids and chemicals ) .
the less immediately attractive parts of science could be approached through these interests , for instance teaching ‘ forces ’ by beginning with the action of muscles in the human arm , and ‘ light ’ via the dissection of a bull 's eye .
when women scientists employ such approaches , and describe their own work , as happened during the vista programme , girls are receiving double encouragement .
these examples indicate some of the features of girl friendly science : it builds on girls ' interests , not just boys ' ; it explicitly encourages girls to see themselves as potential scientists , and it includes some of the social and human implications and applications of science .
other gist interventions
all the gist schools were mixed comprehensives , and at first teachers were most unwilling to separate boys and girls at all , on the grounds that it ran counter to their co-educational comprehensive philosophy .
then certain teachers were particularly struck by the evidence of large differences in the interests and experience children brought with them to school .
girls had far less ‘ tinkering ’ experience than boys and the connection with their lesser interest in topics like ‘ how electricity is produced ’ seemed obvious .
several special science or craft clubs were organized in the lunch hour for girls only and in two schools teachers planned single-sex teaching .
as we shall see , it was in these two schools that the largest measurable changes of attitude and option choice occurred .
for a more girl friendly science , it seems vital that teachers should come to see that when all the masculine packaging , evident in textbooks and resources as well as teachers ' and boys ' behaviour in the classroom , is removed , girls can be very enthusiastic about science . …
alison kelly sees at least four distinct senses in which it can be argued that science is masculine .
first , the pupils , teachers and practitioners of science are overwhelmingly male in terms of numbers ; second , school science is packaged and presented to appeal to boys , not girls ; third , classroom behaviours and interaction operate to reconstruct science as a male activity , and finally it has been suggested that ‘ scientific ’ thinking embodies an intrinsically masculine world view .
the gist interventions described above relate to three of these : vista women , albeit briefly and temporarily , redressed the numerical balance by offering female role models of practising scientists ; vista and the curriculum development which followed involved a limited ‘ repackaging ’ of science to remove its exclusively masculine appeal , and the single-sex classes and classroom observation showed how science comes to be defined as ‘ masculine ’ in the mixed school .
the fourth point , the idea that science is intrinsically masculine , can be sustained only by clinging to an irredeemably narrow conception of science and scientific thinking .
the industrial and social impact of science on health , on people , on the environment , a focus on the beauty and complexity of the natural world , are notable omissions from the school science syllabus .
girls are not uninterested in science , they are bored by the limited version of it they meet in school .
one of the purposes of an extended period of single-sex science teaching might be to let teachers see how girls approach scientific matters , and to discover , what may well be the case , that girls are just as capable of ‘ scientific thinking ’ as boys .
margaret spear , in a different study from the one reported in this volume , found that for identical work boys were marked higher than girls for supposed understanding of principles , aptitude for science and o level suitability ( spear , 1984 ) .
ii the first critique
unity had been easy during the resistance , because relationships were almost always man-to-man .
over against the german army or the vichy government , where social generality ruled , as it does in all machines of state , the resistance offered the rare phenomenon of historical action which remained personal .
the psychological and moral elements of political action were almost the only ones to appear here , which is why intellectuals least inclined to politics were to be seen in the resistance .
the resistance was a unique experience for them , and they wanted to preserve its experience in the new french politics because this experience broke away from the famous dilemma of being and doing , which confronts all intellectuals in the face of action … .
it is only too obvious that this balance between action and personal life was intimately bound up with the conditions of clandestine action and could not survive it .
and in this sense it must be said that the resistance experience , by making us believe that politics is a relationship between man and man or between consciousnesses , fostered our illusions of 1939 and masked the truth of the incredible power of history which the occupation taught us in another connection .
if by 1945 merleau-ponty had here already indicated the historical basis for what was to become sartre 's project in the critique , the theoretical problem that followed was how to unite orthodox marxist concepts of economic determinism and historical necessity with the individualism of sartre 's earlier work , that is the existentialist notion of the authentic self and the possibility of choosing one 's own freedom : how to relocate human practice within historical determinism , to reconcile the individual with the social , the idea of agency with that of necessity , or freedom with history ?
for marxist or hegelian thought , such an age-old contradiction ought to be resolvable through the operations of dialectical logic .
citing marx 's famous remark in the eighteenth brumaire , ‘ men make their own history … but under circumstances … given and transmitted from the past ’ , sartre suggested that this implied ‘ the permanent and dialectical unity of freedom and necessity , ( i , 35 ) .
accordingly , he attempted to shift marxism away from orthodox theories of an absolute determinism towards the primacy of a concept of ‘ history ’ which , while still a totality as it had been for lukács , a process with a determinate meaning and end , could also include a concept of human agency and thus articulate the individual with the social , freedom with determinism .
today , sartre 's voluntarism is to some extent returning to favour as the result of a desire to retrieve the categories of agency and the subject , which goes together with the wish to get out of the apparently totalizing systems of adorno , althusser or foucault .
sartre 's stress on the role of the subject also finds approval because many of those no longer prepared to argue for a general theory of history as the progress of a single narrative of class-struggle , have begun to argue instead for a return of its correlative , the subject , almost as if it was the next best thing in the absence of history itself .
but it still leaves us with the crucial problem that sartre had to solve , namely how to link human consciousness with the processes of history so that the former can be said to be the agent of the latter .
how could this take place ?
as sartre had put it in what is literature ? :
‘ never has homo faber better understood that he has made history and never has he felt so powerless before history ’ .
how can man make history if at the same time it is history which makes him ?
sartre considered that orthodox dialectical materialism takes the easy way out by merely eliminating the first in favour of the second , making man a passive product entirely determined by economic circumstances .
unwilling to follow merleau-ponty by dropping the second in favour of the first , sartre argued that it was possible for man to be both at once through the movement of praxis , that is intentional actions which produce material effects .
its corollary , whereby praxis becomes determining history , he called the ‘ practico-inert ’ , by which he meant the material circumstances that have themselves been created by previous praxes and which form the conditions for new praxis .
the individual is thus both totalizer and totalized , deftly uniting freedom with necessity .
though this neatly solves the problem of how man can make history while at the same time history makes him , it does not answer the larger question of how a multiplicity of the products of individual acts , ‘ totalizations ’ , can themselves be totalized into the overall totalization required by the logic of dialectical rationality — rather than being the arbitrary , blind and self-cancelling movements of , say , hardy 's immanent will .
sartre 's fundamental thesis , that ‘ history continually effects totalisations of totalisations ’ ( i , 15 ) , does not in itself answer what ronald aronson has rightly characterized as the question for sartre : ‘ how do separate , antagonistic actions yield a history ; how do individual totalizations lead to totalization ( and also progress , the direction of history , its truth and its meaning ) ? ’
for the whole basis of sartre 's argument is that the dialectic of history is not a metaphysical law , ‘ some powerful unitary force revealing itself behind history like the will of god ’ , but the continuously produced effect of individual conflicts ; each action is in its turn subsumed as a part of the whole in an ever broader , developing totalization ( i , 37 ) .
what sartre needs to demonstrate , therefore , is that if the law of the dialectic works from the individual level , overall it produces nothing less than the intelligibility or the meaning of history as such :
the dialectic is the law of totalization which creates several collectivities , several societies , and one history — realities , that is , which impose themselves on individuals ; but at the same time it must be woven out of millions of individual actions .
we must show that it is possible for it to be both a resultant … and a totalizing force … how it can continually bring about the unity of dispersive profusion and integration .
( i , 36 )
but what produces the overall direction of history ?
how does it ‘ continually bring about the unity of dispersive profusion and integration ’ ?
sartre does not attempt to answer this question , shifting rather to the notion of a lack of self-consciousness .
the dialectic is the law that remains hidden .
at the moment , ‘ history is made without being known ( l'histoire se fait sans se connâitre ) ’ — history constitutes , we might say today , a political unconscious .
‘ marxism ’ , on the other hand , sartre claims , ‘ is history itself becoming conscious of itself ’ ( i , 40 ) : as for lukács , it is by becoming conscious of itself as the subject of history that the working class will understand history 's meaning — and so recognize itself as the meaning of history .
while he suggests in apocalyptic tones in the problem of method that this process of self-consciousness is at last beginning to take place , and that civil , foreign and colonial wars are becoming apparent as different forms of a single class struggle , sartre also admits that the divorce between theory and praxis which ensued under stalinism has generally prevented any clear self-consciousness among the masses .
the ‘ detour , of stalinism is thus formalized as marxism 's own descent into its unconscious , resulting in a dream-work of heterogeneous histories that have eluded systematization and subsumption into the single meaning of marxism 's own reading of history .
it is therefore , sartre argues , our historical task to make it known , promoting not just the historical process as such , but also the general recognition whereby the plurality of the meanings of individual histories can be seen to combine to make one history , with one meaning — the ‘ truth of humanity ’ ( i , 822 ) .
sartre 's account thus sets up the articulation of history , univocal meaning , and totality as the indissoluble set of elements required for the validation of marxism , necessary in order to save it from its detour from itself .
the problem , however , remains how such universals are produced from the multiplicity of initiating individual praxes .
if history is a history of conflict , how could it be both one and internally diversified without the inner moving principle of the dialectic ?
how can history be a unity if it is also conflictual , if each action is aimed at destroying the other and results in a double negation in which the original aims of each action have been destroyed by the other ?
if each action negates the aim of the other , where is the ‘ unity ’ totalized in the conflict ?
how does history constantly totalize itself ?
( i , 817 — 18 ) sartre arrives at what he calls ‘ the real problem of history ’ , that is how there can be totalization without a totalizer , only at the very end of volume i. it is not until the next volume , however , that he intends to show how individual actions , separate multiplicities , make up ‘ one human history , with one truth and one intelligibility ’ ( i , 69 ) .
throughout , sartre has nevertheless taken it ‘ for granted that such a totalisation is constantly developing both as history and as historical truth ’ ( i , 822 ) .
his history , therefore , is always in process : but its teleology of a final totalization always has to be assumed .
he thus asserts the truth of history while constantly projecting forwards and deferring its proof .
but when the proof comes it also turns out to rest on the assumption that it is already true .
iii the second critique :
‘ we are trying to establish the truth of history'
sartre produces a persuasive formulation of the relation of the individual to the determining historical circumstance through his concepts of praxis and the practico-inert ; it is also obvious to him how the larger question of history ought to be solved .
he asserts it often enough : ‘ history continually effects totalisations of totalisations , ( i , 15 ) .
but in volume i of the critique , as we have seen , he continually defers the demonstration of his proof .
for the ‘ dogmatic dialectic ’ , as he describes dialectical materialism , the whole question naturally poses no problem , for each person or group simply constitutes a partial moment of an already operative movement of totalization that produces them and then goes beyond them .
but sartre 's dispensing with all historicist schemas creates the problem of how , between two autonomous and contradictory totalizations , there could be ‘ one dialectical intelligibility of the ongoing process ’ ( ii , 13 ) .
he attempts to solve this through matching his account of contradiction with a new concept derived from the conjunction of work and labour : ‘ anti-labour ’ ( anti-travail ) , a category of negation .
the products of a conflict , as well as its residues , may seem incomprehensible insofar as they differ from the original intentions of any of the combatants .
nevertheless they constitute the basis and conditions for further actions and history .
dialectical reason encounters such products as undecidables :
aporias — because they seem to be at once the results of a communal enterprise while at the same time bearing witness to the fact that this enterprise never existed except as the inhuman reverse side of two opposed actions in which each aims to destroy the other .
in the dialectical perspective , we encounter these objects as productions which are human and provided with a future … thus they seem by themselves to be totalizations in process .
( ii , 20 )
this means that first , they lead to results , and second , that the internal structure of social objects contains ‘ the double negation of themselves and of each constituent part by the other ’ ( ii , 22 ) .
there is , therefore , before any understanding of historic agents and movements , a certain aporia in all social ensembles : from afar they may appear whole , but close to , they can be seen as riddled with holes .
this increasingly comes to resemble nothing so much as sartre 's own account of history .
in the context of the negativity of this formulation , sartre is obliged to pose once again the problem of whether there can be a totalization , without any independent totalizer or totalizing force such as the dialectic , or whether the structure of negation that he has described means that , as for adorno or bakhtin , history does not develop positively but , rather , negatively , and is therefore instead detotalizing :
marxism is rigorously true if history is totalization ; it is not so any more if human history decomposes into a plurality of particular histories , or if , in any case , within the relationship of immanence that characterizes struggle , the negation of each adversary by the other is on principle detotalizing .
certainly , we have neither the design nor the actual possibility of showing here the full truth of dialectical materialism …
our goal is solely to establish whether , in a practical ensemble torn apart by antagonism ( whether there are multiple conflicts or whether they are reduced to one ) the breaks themselves are totalizing and carried along by the totalizing movement of the ensemble .
( ii , 25 )
at this point sartre confronts the possibility that the whole project of the critique , stated so confidently on its very first page — ‘ it must be proved that a negation of a negation can be an affirmation ’ ( i , 15 ) — may break down .
perhaps the truth of history can not be proved ; its direction can not be discerned .
sartre 's reaction to the threat that the negation of a negation may produce a detotalizing effect is to introduce a new category , a unifying force of a ‘ singularization ’ which incarnates the universal : ‘ if totalization really is an ongoing process ’ , he writes , ‘ then it operates everywhere .
that means both that there is a dialectical meaning of the practical ensemble … and that each singular event totalizes in itself the practical ensemble in the infinite richness of its singularity ’ ( ii , 26 ) .
unlike lukács ' insignificant event from which the universal is precariously drawn out through the narrative , sartre 's singularity works synecdochally in a conventional antinomy with the universal , the relation between the two structured according to the familiar nineteenth-century model of organic growth or process in which each singular event makes up the whole while , as he puts it , ‘ the whole is entirely present in the part as its present meaning and as its destiny ’ .
sartre 's ‘ singular universal ’ , therefore , begs the question , for it is predicated on the assumption that , if there is not a totality as such , then there already is an overall totalization : ‘ if totalization really is an ongoing process … ’ .
that developing process is itself totalized through sartre 's assertion that each totalization is the totalization of all struggles , as it must be if the singular is to incarnate the universal .
the concept of the singular universal thus facilitates a circularity in the argument whereby sartre can avoid the question which he began by posing .
so the singular universal presumes the totalization he ca n't ( yet ) prove .
this strategy marks a structure of repetition in sartre 's text : each time he poses the question of how there can be totalization of history without a totalizer , he retreats to a more limited example whose unity is already evident , but which in the end only brings him back to the original question again .
in this case sartre demonstrates how the singular universal works , by appealing to the concrete example of a boxing match — a random exemplification that just happens to reproduce the single adversaries of the master/slave dialectic .
its totalization takes place through its incarnation , as part of the totality of boxing , in the overall framework within which each individual fight occurs .
each boxing match , sartre claims , must be both a unique event and also in some sense the incarnation of all boxing , whose rules and conventions it follows , and whose past and future history it sets itself against .
but it is also apparent that that totality is not completely known , nor is its future shape even presumed .
by totalization , therefore , sartre does not here mean anything like a predetermined end or final closure of a totality but rather a process of mediation among the parts , where each is determined by the other .
no one can predict the future of boxing , either at the level of particular victories or defeats , in effect a structure of repetition , nor at the more general level of possible modifications or developments of the sport .
yet each individual bout articulates itself within the framework of the history of boxing , known and unknown .
this allows sartre to include chance and contingency in his scheme .
since it can not be known as a concept that will realize itself in the future , sartre argues instead that the totality only produces itself in the moment : ‘ the incarnation as such is at once unrealizable except as totalization of everything and irreducible to a pure abstract unity of that which it totalizes ’ ( ii , 58 ) .
the universal , the totality , can only be known through the singular .
but its future direction remains unknown and indeterminate .
at the same time sartre makes a larger , though less persuasive claim that the boxing-match also works synecdochally and re-exteriorizes a more fundamental violence , namely the interiorized condition of scarcity that he considers to be the basis of conflict in general .
the boxing match ‘ is the public incarnation of all conflict ’ ( ii , 32 ) , totalizing in its own struggle the whole of ‘ contemporary irreducibilities and fissures ’ ( ii , 26 ) :
thus one can and must say … that each fight is the singularisation of all the circumstances of the social whole in movement and that by this singularisation , it incarnates the enveloping totalization which the historical process is .
( ii , 58 )
but then he adds , ‘ i have said and i repeat that we have not yet proved that this enveloping totalization exists ’ .
so , although it is possible to conceive of any event as an incarnation of the totality , insofar as it must itself make up a part of that totality in its determination , unlike the case of the boxing match , where we can define the overall entity ‘ boxing ’ , it still remains unproven that an overall entity , ‘ history ’ , can be said to exist at all .
for all his use of the model of the boxing match , sartre has really got no further with the fundamental question of how there can be totalization without a totalizer .
it is simple enough for him to show that a boxing match takes place within a general totality of ‘ boxing ’ , which is itself only ever present in any individual incarnation , for as a game each match is both an individual bout and something conducted according to general rules and a specific social tradition .
but what about those conflicts that do not take place within such a constituted social system , such as conflictual bourgeois societies which can not be said to be unified , except , as sartre suggests dismissively , by appeal to a lost paradise before the class struggle ?
such societies make the conflicts of history irreducible to sartre 's logic unless , like the boxing match , they can be shown to take part in a larger totalizable category .
however , when he poses the question of whether his method could work as well for the class struggle as for the boxing match , sartre admits that he finds it impossible to answer and returns instead to the much easier case of sub-groups .
once again he backtracks and assumes a larger unity in which conflict takes place .
the major question thus always remains unanswered in the critique : every time that sartre announces that he is about to proceed with the fundamental problem of how history can be a totalization without a totalizer , he turns back to a previous , more easily intelligible stage on the way .
his difficulty is accompanied by a no doubt symptomatic increasing distrust of universals so that , in championing specificities against them , he seems to give up the attempt to validate the universals — history as totalization — that originally formed the object of his project .
at this point a further contradiction in sartre 's whole enterprise begins to open up : for someone so deeply distrustful of universals it seems curious that he has involved himself so emphatically with the notions of totality , history , and the dialectic .
as sartre insists more and more upon the virtues of specificity ( ii , 200 — 05 ) , such is his distaste for marxist or any other universalizing categories that he refuses even to countenance them , attempting to replace concepts with specificities , universals with singulars .
his scepticism goes to the extent of even denying the existence of ‘ society ’ or ‘ the nation ’ as such ( ii , 24 , 61 ) — the very totalities which his own general argument for totalization requires .
here certain similarities with later ‘ post-marxist ’ theorists such as foucault or lyotard , begin to become apparent .
but if sartre anticipates such later thinkers we should not assume too quickly that they have simply taken his insights further .
for sartre 's singular universal could never be expected to solve the formal theoretical problem of how individual existential existence can be related to history insofar as it simply renames , in one oxymoronic category , the original antithetical terms .
without an adequate theory of their articulation , they simply begin to separate again .

the philosopher 's child
judith hughes
some of our children are missing
children have served philosophy very well .
that is the first thing which anyone surveying the literature would notice .
along with a selection from a list including women , animals , madmen , foreigners , slaves , patients and imbeciles , children have served in that great class of beings , the ‘ not-men ’ , in contrast with which male philosophers have defined and valued themselves .
unlike the others who appear and disappear as fashion and progress dictate , children occupy a permanent place in the list partly because of their continuing presence as a potential sub-class , partly because they have never protested and mainly because it is assumed that in favourable circumstances they will become men and therefore require attention .
they have received it in the shape of detailed educational theory carefully worked out to see them through the maturation process from infancy to adulthood .
generations of philosophers have documented this process .
perhaps the best known version is shakespeare 's seven ages of man which is a poetic statement of what had already been received wisdom for centuries and was to remain so for centuries to come .
education was to guide the infant through the transition to manhood including such stages as childhood , boyhood and youth .
that is the second thing to notice ; the philosopher 's children are boys .
the fact that at least half of the world 's children would not actually go through this process beyond the first two stages is conveniently forgotten or ignored and , no doubt , the reasons for this were largely social .
but the neglect of girl children through the centuries of theorising is more than a social injustice , though many might think this real and bad enough .
education has an end .
although it is fashionable to talk about its value ‘ for its own sake ’ , what prompts the theorising is the strong and well-founded belief that the experiences of childhood affect the kind of adult which the child turns out to be .
where the end is person- rather than role-oriented — that is , where the end is the development of the human mind and spirit rather than the production of , say , information technologists — then education is valued in relation to some conception of worthwhile human existence which it is meant to serve .
such an ideal does not stand isolated from the practices which strive towards it but interacts with those practices , helps to construct them , and is in turn constructed by them .
the great philosophers have always produced such a person-oriented account at least for those whose education was thought to matter .
education has been directed at the production of the rational , the free , the independent of mind , the dignified , in short , the autonomous human being .
yet because the philosopher 's adult has traditionally been male , his children boy children , and his educational programmes designed to facilitate the transition between them , the ideal of the fully human person has been masculinised to the point where otherwise thoughtful and sometimes good and wise men have unashamedly admitted that this defining ideal is not applicable to half the species .
rationality turns into narrow intellectualism , freedom into licence , independence into isolationism , dignity into selfish pride ; the autonomous human being turns out to be no more than a social atom after all .
the degeneration occurs , not because men are congenitally or even incorrigibly narrow , libertine , isolated or selfish , but because in defining themselves as autonomous beings in opposition to other human beings they have had to seek what separates them as a group from others .
it is a curiously paradoxical foundation uponupon which to build a theory of autonomy .
moral autonomy is concerned with individuals not with groups ; a conception of autonomy which depends upon group membership displays its own contradiction .
this paper is partly about the rejection of certain accounts of autonomy though not with the rejection of the ideal of autonomy itself .
it is also about children .
women philosophers and girl children
why should women in general and women philosophers in particular be specially interested in the nature and status of children ?
there are , of course , the familiar and obvious reasons connected with women 's traditional role in child-rearing but there are less obvious reasons too .
when philosophers dismiss women as ‘ not-men ’ they frequently do more than simply lump them together with children or lunatics .
explicitly or implicitly the suggestion is that women are children or lunatics or whichever other company they keep .
it would be well to know just what this entails .
schopenhauer said that women remain big children all their lives ; it would be interesting to know what he thought children were like .
a common result of this is that when the philosophers deny autonomy to women , they do so for the same sorts of reason that they deny it to children and cite lack of rationality , capriciousness and vulnerability among their characteristics .
we can do more than to reject such descriptions of ourselves ; we can ask further questions : are children like this ? is this why children are not autonomous ?
again , women well know what it is like to be treated as children and they find it offensive .
it would therefore be reasonable to consider whether children find it offensive to be treated like children .
is being treated as a child an intrinsically humiliating and self-denying experience ?
what is it to be treated as a child ?
women philosophers are in a special position to consider such questions for in the image of the philosopher 's child they see themselves .
it is no accident that the liberation of women , such as it is , should form part of a wider movement of liberation in general ; liberation for one part of the ‘ not-men ’ is bound to have a knock-on effect when your fellow groups are sometimes quite literally identified with you .
the assumption that all groups in the ‘ not-men ’ class are identical with each other is so firmly rooted that , as we shall see in the fourth section , it is readily assumed even by modern libertarian thinkers that showing that , for example , some ground for distinguishing between men and women is false or irrelevant , immediately commits us to the view that the same ground is irrelevant in distinguishing men from children .
‘ that 's what they used to say about women ’ is not a proof that saying it about a child is false .
but it should make us very suspicious .
that when women are given the vote it follows that children should be given it too is no argument at all , but a version of it occurs in modern debates over the justice or injustice of mill 's famous disclaimer in his essay on liberty .
having denied that we may ever legitimately interfere with the liberty of another except on the grounds of self-protection , mill ( 1910 ) asserts :
this principle is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties .
we are not speaking of children or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood .
those who are still in a state to require being taken care of by others must be protected against their own actions as well as against external injury .
( p.73 )
this view , as we shall see , has been attacked on the grounds that it rests on the false assumption that the distinction between adults and children is identical with the distinction between rational and non-rational beings .
the attacks are based on empirical observation ; most women and older children are actually quite as rational as most men while some men are actually less rational .
if we agree that in that case women should be embraced by the liberty principle then so should children .
i shall suggest that this does not follow because rationality is not in fact the grounds for the distinction in the first place .
partly to redress the balance and partly because talking about ‘ children ’ covers such a wide range of potential images , i shall try to keep before my mind an ordinary 10-year-old of our society .
she is the child of this paper unless i indicate otherwise .
throughout we should ask ourselves , does this ( whatever is being said ) apply to her ?
first of all , let us remind ourselves of the traditional picture of children drawn for us by some great philosophers of the past .
one thing they are all quite sure about is that children are not like adults ; in particular they agree that children lack some capacity for rational thought which adults have .
now we are 6 — or 10 — or 18 … .
the slave has absolutely no deliberative faculty ; the woman has but its authority is imperfect ; so has the child , but in this case it is immature .
( aristotle , 1959,1260a )
children … are not endued with reason at all , till they have attained the use of speech but are called reasonable creatures for the possibility apparent of having the use of reason in time to come .
( hobbes , 1914 , p. 21 )
children … love to be treated as rational creatures sooner than is imagined … by which …
i mean , that you should make them sensible by the mildness of your carriage , and the composure even in your correction of them , that what you do is reasonable in you and useful and necessary for them .
( locke , 1968 , p. 181 )
in training for youth , the child must be given reasons ; in the training of the infant for childhood this can not be done .
young children ought merely to have things shown to them as they are , or they get puzzled and ask question after question .
but as we approach the age of youth reason appears .
at what age ought the education for youth to begin ?
roughly at the age of ten years , when by nature the child enters the stage of youth and begins to reflect …
the youth … is capable of having principles ; his religious and moral ideas can be cultivated , and he is able to attend to his own refinement .
( kant , 1930 , pp. 250–1 )
if a society lets any considerable number of its members grow up mere children , incapable of being acted on by rational consideration of distant motives , society has itself to blame for the consequences .
( mill , 1910 , p. 139 )
what are the philosophers ' children like ?
they have an ‘ immature ’ deliberative faculty ( aristotle ) , are not ‘ endued with reason ’ ( hobbes ) , until roughly the age of 10 ( kant ) and are ‘ incapable of being acted upon by rational consideration of distant motives ’ ( mill ) .
but they are not completely lost causes .
the immature deliberative faculty will mature ; children have the ‘ possibility apparent ’ of turning into rational beings ( hobbes ) ; they love to be reated as though they were rational though they are not so yet ( locke ) ; you can give the prerational child reasons for acting in certain ways and he will turn into the youth who is capable of having principles ( kant ) .
until the time when these things happen then mill 's disclaimer comes into operation .
children must be taken care of by others and protected from external injury and against their own actions .
the traditional view is encapsulated in the claim that children are not autonomous ; that is , on a standard interpretation , they lack the capacity to act rationally in pursuit of their own self-chosen goals .
it is then a matter of preference whether you say that they can not choose the goals or that they can not form strategies to achieve them or both .
in either case , the political implication is that denying rights to children is entirely justified , and there the matter rests .
in all this , there are perhaps a couple of things which look plausible when we compare the philosopher 's child with our mental picture ; aristotle 's observation that children are immature and mill 's suggestion that they might need protection .
beyond that , the similarities seem remote .
there is obviously something wrong with a portrayal of children as totally lacking in reason until they leap out of bed on their tenth birthday announcing that they are now able to act on principle .
apart from being false , such an account leaves no room in our thinking about children for things like teaching and learning , or development in understanding and character and all those other concepts which refer to processes and not to states .
the tension between these theoretical views of children as non-rational , non-autonomous beings and the practical knowledge of real children is evident in those quotations from hobbes and locke and kant and mill .
children , according to hobbes , have the ‘ possibility apparent ’ of becoming reasonable .
in what does the possibility consist ?
hobbes is not using an inductive argument here ; the ‘ possibility apparent ’ is not an inductive argument from observations about past children but is meant to refer to some discernible feature of present ones .
but what ?
hobbes does not tell us , but whatever it is it had better be something which a monkey does not have .
it is not language since hobbes is here talking about the prelinguistic child .
perhaps it consists in the ability to respond intelligently to the language of others .
but then , either hobbes has failed to distinguish the child from at least the higher and domesticated animals or the force of ‘ intelligently ’ must be explained in such a way as to exclude animals .
in any case , if such a qualification is called for it is hard to see how a creature with no rationality at all could possess it .
locke 's remarks are just as puzzling .
children are definitely not rational but love to be treated as if they were .
how is this possible ?
apparently they like having things explained to them without understanding either the explanation or even what an explanation is .
perhaps he just means that they like the sound of my voice ?
well , maybe they do , but making any old noises is clearly not sufficient to enter the rationality stakes ; i must at least say something .
is it just that i talk to them that they love ?
maybe , but i can also , if i like , talk to my car , but yelling at it in the approved basil fawlty manner is hardly treating it as rational .
lockean children have the added amazing ability to recognise reason in you without possessing any themselves , while kantian kids , two stages back from rationality , have the disconcerting habit of getting puzzled and asking questions .
mill 's minors are a little more complicated .
part of the time he sees them in the familiar way as creatures who lack rationality to at least some degree .
but in the disclaimer his children need above all to be protected from the ghastly consequences of their own actions .
their problem seems to be not one of the inability to choose goals or to form strategies for achieving them , but an incorrigible propensity to choose the wrong ones and an awesome efficiency in achieving them unless adults intervene .
all in all , it is a pretty unconvincing picture .
if you say that children are completely non-rational then you have to account for the fact that they become rational , and to do that it appears from these examples that you have to assume that they already are .
if , on the other hand , you allow rationality to children , then you can not use their lack of it as a criterion to distinguish them from adults .
hobbes et al .
are not aware of the unreality of their original pictures which is why , often in the same sentence , they produce these contradictions .
the one thing they do not do is to re-examine the original for the tell-tale signs of forgery .
illegitimate inferences
the recognition that children can not simply be written off in the rationality stakes and can not therefore be denied autonomy on this account has led some writers to conclude that they can not , therefore , be denied it on any account .
we should notice that this view is not just a flight of fancy from the loony left , the pederast lobby or children themselves .
it is also to be found in stronger or weaker versions of more cautious academic thought .
in escape from childhood ( 1974 ) , john holt notes that children are , in fact , capable of a great deal more than modern society allows them to be .
he sees childhood as a fairly modern invention designed to fit adult rather than children 's needs , and an oppressive invention at that .
he suggests that children should be given a comprehensive range of civil and legal rights including the right to vote , to manage their own financial affairs , to direct and manage their own education and to control their own sex lives and
to make and enter into , on a basis of mutual consent , quasifamilial relationships outside one 's immediate family — i.e. the right to seek and choose guardians other than one 's own parents and to be legally dependent on them .
( holt , 1974 , p. 16 )
this is also the view put forward by john harris , though in less specific terms .
like holt , harris believes that the so-called incompetence of children is an adult invention imposed on children for adults ' convenience .
he makes a firm proposal that the age of majority should be gradually reduced to 10 years , and remarks :
we must remember that to deny someone control of their own lives is to offer them a most profound insult , not to mention the which the frustration of their wishes and the setting at naught of their own plans for themselves will add .
perhaps we should conduct annual examinations from an early age to be sure that we do as little of this sort of damage as possible ?
( harris , 1982 , p. 49 )
now holt and harris both have many wise , enlightened and humane observations to make about some of the injustices which we inflict upon children , but as these remarks show , putting them right without inflicting equally grave injustice is no easy matter .
both of them appear to suffer from a form of mental myopia in imagining the consequences of such proposals , and i am not here referring only to mill-type consequences of harm brought about by unwise decisions .
what , we may ask holt , happens to the child who , dissatisfied at home , seeks in vain for guardians who would suit him ?
what if no one wants him ?
our papers are currently full of ‘ hard-to-place ’ children in local authority care advertising for foster or adoptive parents .
in such a situation the skilled care of social workers is crucial to ensuring that an unwanted by-product of success for some children is not the total destruction of self-esteem for others .
what , we may ask harris , happens to the child who repeatedly fails his annual examination ?
to impose such a test on children would be a particularly invidious way of discriminating against them , unless harris has in mind that we should all undergo such examination .
he might then be open to bitter objections from many adults .
these two suggestions , far from being enlightened liberation of all children , are actually oppression of a deeply damaging kind to at least some , and harris 's suggestion contains a capacity criterion in disguise .
in any case , it would be dishonest to pretend that mill-type consequences are not relevant here .
suppose holt 's 6-year-old does opt out of school ?
what happens to her then ?
what happens if her father is unwilling or unable to stay at home with her ?
is it any better to oblige her to go abseiling or butterfly-catching instead ?
however much she may enjoy such pursuits , there will be times when she would actually rather wander the streets unaccompanied .
given that holt is presumably not volunteering himself to take care of her , who will ?
his view that letting children run in and out of busy airports smartly avoiding the traffic is perfectly reasonable depends upon a conception of a child which is far narrower than even the sex divide .
holt 's child is actually the artful dodger ; mercifully , not all children are .
there are other difficulties too .
it is not clear whether or not harris thinks that children of 10 should be obliged to take on full political status whether or not they want to , but holt clearly does not .
he proposes that ‘ the rights , privileges , duties , responsibilities of adult citizens be made available to any young person , of whatever age , who wants to make use of them ’ ( holt , 1974 , p. 15 ) .
if holt thinks that this proposal would remove an arbitrary boundary line between adults and children , then he is mistaken .
the point about an adult citizen is that he has these rights , privileges , duties and responsibilities whether or not he wants them .
he may not exercise his rights or he may shirk his duties , but he can not forgo them .
they are not just available to him , they are his .
that is what being a citizen involves .
rights and privileges do not pose any particular problems in the case of children .
holt can and does believe that children should have them as adults do , and then leaves it up to the child to decide whether or not to exercise them .
but the same can not be said for duties and responsibilities .
failure to exercise one 's rights may be morally neutral ; failure to carry out one 's duties is not .
it would be perfectly possible to give the rights to children without imposing the duties on them , the one does not entail the other , but we would then still be distinguishing between adults and children as citizens .
children still would not have full political status .
duties and responsibilities are not merely available to a citizen ; they are an integral part of being a citizen .
holt does not want children to be obliged to take on any of these responsibilities and he manages to make his point by concentrating solely on the rights so that he can remark :
i do not say , either , that these rights and duties should be tied into one package , that if a young person wants to assume any of them , he must assume them all .
he should be able to pick and choose .
( holt , 1974 , p. 16 )
if he can ‘ pick and choose ’ , i suggest , he is not a citizen , he does not have full political status and he is quite distinguishable on these grounds alone from the adults around him who do not have this option .
holt and harris both , in the end , face the same problem .
they attack the status quo by pointing out that the reasons given for denying rights to children are bad reasons , and then explicitly or implicitly deny them duties for no reason at all .
whatever else such a strategy may achieve , it certainly does not manage to produce a situation in which children are politically indistinguishable from adults and it rests on premises which , unless they can be defended , gain nothing for any defence to the charge of arbitrariness .
when in doubt , go back to aristotle
the trouble with all the views which we have looked at is that they tie the notion of autonomy firmly and solely to that of knowledge interpreted in either a broad or narrow sense .
that it is firmly tied must be correct ; the inhabitants of brave new world are not autonomous precisely because they are denied access to relevant information .
relevant knowledge is a precondition of autonomy but it is not synonymous with it .
aristotle said something very interesting in that extract from the politics which i quoted earlier ; he said that women have a deliberative faculty but that it lacks full authority .
what did he mean ?
twenty-eight
nairobi .
we start with a young man , thomas fairfax , in military khaki and flying jacket , climbing into his old biplane and taxiing down a runway .
he adjusts the flaps , zips up his jacket , pulls down his goggles .
the runway is simply a strip of grass , cleared of rocks .
the plane lurches into motion .
it bounces alarmingly as it gathers speed .
a few africans , clutching sticks and wearing skins , watch the plane as it turns , pauses , and then accelerates , leaving a cloud of dust .
the plane climbs reluctantly , one set of wings dipping drunkenly .
soon it is passing over the spectacular rift valley .
there is no sign of civilization , but herds of zebra and wildebeest and clumps of elephants marble the valley floor .
ol doinyo lengai .
a group of masai is clearing stones from a stretch of grassland , in the shadow of the mountain of god .
a large white cross has been painted roughly on the ground .
claudia cohn-casson is sitting under an enormous african fig tree near by , at a camp table spread with a somali cloth .
she has in front of her a typewriter , her recorder and her notes .
a servant is preparing lunch on a fire .
claudia hears something .
she looks up into the sky in the direction of ol doinyo lengai .
we catch sight of a small plane circling the mountain .
it dips its wings in acknowledgement of the landing strip , and circles , preparing to land .
claudia stands up .
she checks her appearance in a mirror hanging on a tree .
with her lower lip she tucks the upper lip into her mouth for a moment .
she is wearing a long fitted skirt of khaki .
she adjusts her hat , a round bush hat , and walks towards the makeshift landing strip .
the plane is taxiing , pursued by a group of running masai warriors , glorious in their red and purple robes , ochred hair , lion head-dresses and so on .
claudia walks over towards the plane .
she holds her hat on her head with one hand .
the plane is still now , surrounded by the warriors .
fairfax is securing its wheels with rocks .
he looks up to see her approaching .
behind her is ol doinyo lengai .
its strange shape has become familiar to us .
his face is still dirty from the dust and oil , except that around his eyes is a white patch where the goggles were .
the masai begin to sing .
it is a strange , other-worldly noise .
claudia and fairfax approach each other .
the moment is unnaturally , poignantly , delayed .
in his uniform , jacket unzipped , he is handsome and smiling .
the singing of the masai and the overwhelming landscape are thrilling .
claudia and fairfax come closer .
she is serene .
he is perhaps surprised by her composure .
she kisses him , three times .
‘ i am so glad you came . ’
( her accent is very french but she speaks english fluently . )
‘ anything to help a friend . ’
fairfax is awkward .
he would like to say something more graceful .
‘ your face is dirty .
you look , how you say ? , as a raccoon . ’
fairfax laughs .
he wipes his face with his sleeve .
‘ sorry . ’
‘ i have prepared the lunch . ’
she touches his arm lightly .
they start to walk the short distance to her camp .
the throng of masai surrounds them .
her servant brings a bowl of hot water for fairfax .
he washes his face .
the masai watch all this .
fairfax and claudia sit down on camp chairs .
the masai stand a short distance off , curious , but self-absorbed .
‘ what would you like to drink ? ’
‘ can you manage a brandy and soda ? ’
‘ i think so . ’
she speaks swahili to the servant .
‘ now , do you want to tell me all the facts ? ’
‘ as far as i know them .
yes .
the masai who has been arrested , tepilit , is from this district .
these people are from his engang .
he was supposed to deliver a bull to the district officer , it was about three weeks ago , and he decided at the last moment to replace the bull with another one .
but the district officer , miles turnbull , would not accept it … ’
her face , as she removes her hat and begins to speak , is startlingly beautiful , although not conventionally .
fairfax watches her .
as she talks the servant brings the drinks and then the lunch , a grilled fowl with some preserves .
as she speaks we see a masai market .
spread around are hundreds of masai men and women .
some of the women are in robes of blue , others are in brown , dyed skins .
the older men have blankets loosely slung over their shoulders .
almost every man is accompanied by a goat or a cow , held on a short leather thong or controlled by a thin stick .
those animals are accustomed to the masai .
there is , incongruously , an open car to one side of the market .
from it , into the colourful throng , appears a young british district officer , miles turnbull .
he is carrying some papers and is accompanied by two askaris with rifles , and an interpreter , dressed in khakis .
the askaris wear military sweaters , sam brownes , shorts and socks .
on their heads they wear fezes .
‘ the whole thing was ridiculous and tragic .
this man was very much liked by the masai .
but he was overworked .
he had to collect the cattle and make sure that every boma was contributing his fair share .
his district stretches nearly one hundred and fifty miles .
i liked him , even though he was a little bit boring .
he was so english .
he could not speak masai so he always was accompanied by this man , a nandi , who , i am afraid , does not speak masai very good . ’
‘ very well .
sorry . ’
‘ very well .
so the laibon 's son from up there , up the valley past lengai , he is a descendant of mbatian , the great laibon , he tries to persuade turnbull to let him take out his animal from the ones which have been selected . ‘
the young warrior , tepilit , is arguing with the district officer .
he is still vividly scarred from his recent encounter with a lion .
his face is painted and he is carrying a spear .
on his head he wears a head-dress of lion mane .
turnbull explains through the interpreter that time is short ; it is late ; there is a great war on with the germans .
he can not wait for the proposed exchange of animals .
but he tries to be reasonable .
‘ how long will it take , anyway ? ’
‘ tomorrow it will be ready .
i will bring it . ’
‘ it will be too late .
tell him that i am very sorry but i can not make exceptions .
he has had plenty of time . ’
the masai warrior , tepilit , is excited .
a number of other masai gather round .
he says that this particular animal is a favourite .
he strokes its side , which is white and marked with round patches of black , like islands on a naïvely drawn map .
it is a beautiful animal , with huge , curved horns .
‘ i will bring you two cattle tomorrow .
i will go now and deliver them myself to narok . ’
‘ tell him i am very sorry , but i must fill the quota . ’
turnbull busies himself with his clipboard as his reply is translated .
‘ take the animal now , ’ he says to his assistant gently .
as they move forward , tepilit , without warning , hurls his spear at the district officer from a few feet away .
it is a heavy weapon .
between the knife-shaped iron blade and the tapered tail of the spear is a rounded handle made from a particularly hard tree .
this piece of wood passes right through turnbull , so that he is skewered .
a fountain of blood at first pours from his chest , but soon subsides become a steady trickle .
tepilit watches as the district officer performs a brief hokey-cokey before falling face down .
this drives the spear almost completely through his body .
nobody moves .
the watching masai begin to walk away after a long , contemplative moment .
they seem to be weighing the incident carefully in their minds .
the askaris panic .
they cock their rifles and fire into the air .
now they guard the body , which is motionless in a lake of blood that is rapidly drying , drunk by the thirsty , insatiable soil .
you can almost hear the soil gulping .
tepilit drives his bull away .
he walks without a backward glance .
he has in one hand a stick and is followed by a thin dog .
this little group begins to mount a hill .
nobody makes a move to stop him .
the strange singing of the masai rises .
from a distance we see tepilit , walking steadily towards ol doinyo lengai with his animals .
they are tiny figures in a huge landscape .
fairfax has finished eating , but claudia 's food is untouched .
‘ the next day he presented himself for arrest . ’
‘ did you know this man ? ’
‘ i knew his family well . ’
‘ did you see him after the killing ? ’
‘ he came to my house and told me what had happened . ’
‘ and you told him to give himself up ? ’
‘ of course .
what else should i do ? ’
‘ i 'm just asking .
if i can do anything i must know the facts . ’
‘ the facts are not so clear .
this man , tepilit , was injured helping me with the filming of a lion hunt .
now i must help him . ’
‘ when is the trial ? ’
‘ it 's not arranged yet .
but i have tried to talk to him , to persuade him to say that he thought the askaris were going to shoot him or that it was a misunderstanding , but he refuse absolutely to excuse himself . ’
‘ i 'll talk to him .
i 'll talk to the dc .
i heard about the lion hunt .
sounds a bit of a balls-up . ’
‘ a balls-up ?
it was worse than a balls-up .
it was a disaster .
his brother was killed .
all for a film .
and that bastard , un vrai salaud — do you speak french ? — leavitt walked away very happy . ’
‘ he was the producer ? ’
‘ he was an exploiter .
he did n't care about the masai .
he wanted blood , any blood .
lions , masai , all equal . ’
‘ why do you think he did it ?
the moran , i mean ? ’
‘ i do n't know . ’
there is a pause .
‘ shall we take some coffee now ? ’
claudia summons her servant who brings a coffee pot .
‘ i 'll go and see him tomorrow .
do n't worry . ’
the jail at ngiro narok .
it is a small police post with cells at the back .
in front of the building is a row of white-painted stones and some cactus-like sisal plants forming a circle around a patch of grass .
in the middle of the grass is a flagpole from which the union jack hangs .
a car pulls up outside .
an askari salutes as fairfax steps out of the car in uniform .
he enters the building .
a young white policeman appears from his office reluctantly .
he straightens up and salutes fairfax .
‘ sorry , major .
i 'm sergeant jeavons , sir . ’
‘ major fairfax .
i want to talk to the masai man you are holding .
i have the papers . ’
‘ are you the defence , sir ? ’
‘ no , i 'm here to make a report to the governor . ’
the sergeant 's face is elaborately composed .
in a bare , mud-walled cell , sitting on the floor , is tepilit .
he does not appear to be disheartened .
he looks at fairfax without fear .
from behind the sergeant , an askari shouts at tepilit .
‘ stand up man .
attention . ’
fairfax speaks to tepilit in maa .
‘ i hope you are well , tepilit ole saibol . ’
then he turns to the policeman : ‘ that 's fine , sergeant .
you may leave me here . ’
fairfax shakes hands with tepilit and sits on small stool .
tepilit squats on the floor .
‘ how are you ? ’
‘ i am fine . ’
‘ what age group are you ? ’
‘ botorok . ’
‘ is your father the laibon ? ’
‘ yes .
he is descended from mbatian . ’
‘ you have killed a lion . ’
‘ hooh .
i am praised because i held it by the tail . ’
‘ does your father have many cattle ? ’
‘ we are owners of many cattle . ’
‘ i am happy .
do you know me ? ’
‘ you are the friend of claudia from the government . ‘
‘ i am a friend of claudia .
i am a soldier .
at the moment , as you know , the white people and their friends are fighting with the germans .
this is a very big war . ’
‘ our people also fought the germans . ’
‘ your people fought very bravely . ’
‘ the masai are brave . ’
‘ we know this .
we honour the masai above all people . ’
‘ what do you want to discuss ? ’
‘ i am here because i was asked to come by claudia .
she wants me to talk to you . ’
‘ there is no need .
i have told her everything that happened . ’
‘ she is unhappy .
she does not want you to be tried by the government . ’
‘ we are betrothed .
she is my little heifer . ’
fairfax is stunned .
it takes him a moment to regain his composure .
‘ you are going to be married ? ’
‘ she must first ask her father who lives far away . ’
‘ do you realize what will happen to you if you are tried ? ’
tepilit makes a gesture by placing his hand to his throat and cupping it .
‘ i ca n't see any point in that .
when you killed the district officer it was an accident . ’
‘ i killed him on purpose . ’
‘ what i want to say is this , there was a misunderstanding .
i will tell the government .
you thought the nandi , the fat belly , wanted the askaris to shoot you . ’
‘ no .
i did not .
the white man told the askaris to take my animal after i had offered to exchange it .
he took my best animal , even though i offered two in its place .
that is why i killed him .
and now my family have offered forty-nine cattle to his family , but the government will not take them to give to his family in england . ’
‘ white men have different customs . ’
‘ they do n't like cattle . ’
‘ some like cattle .
i have many cattle on my farm . ’
‘ are they milk cattle living in a house as i have heard ? ’
‘ not all .
many are masai cattle .
tepilit ole saibol , i have a heavy burden .
only you can help me .
i have to talk to the governor .
i have to explain to him what happened .
the nandi man has run away , frightened .
i can say to the governor that you misunderstood the order and tried to defend yourself .
not the district officer 's order , but the translator 's who spoke too fast without proper consideration , as nandi people do , and the askaris pointed their guns at you .
you threw the spear wildly .
unfortunately the district officer stepped forward .
if i tell him that they will fine you .
‘ many of my people saw me .
they know that i killed him on purpose because he took my best animal . ’
‘ if you say that at your trial , they will kill you . ’
‘ i have offered cattle to his family .
i can do no more . ’
fairfax stands up .
‘ think about what i said .
i will come back . ’
‘ go in peace . ’
‘ please god . ’
tepilit does not stand up .
he seems content .
the sergeant meets fairfax outside the cell .
‘ all right , sir ? ’
‘ not really .
has he made a statement ? ’
‘ yes , sir .
he admits killing the do .
no excuses . ’
‘ can i read his statement ? ’
‘ i 'm afraid it 's gone off to the high court , sir . ’
‘ you have n't got a copy here ? ’
‘ we have n't had any carbon paper for two years , sir . ’
‘ was it taken down by a policeman ? ’
‘ yes , sir .
by me , sir . ’
‘ do you speak masai ? ’
‘ no , sir , but we got the larusa translator in .
he 's the official police translator , sir .
we read it back to the man twice .
it took me most of a whole day , sir . ’
in the cell tepilit sits motionless on the floor .
at claudia 's camp it is almost evening .
the light in the sky is there by courtesy of the vanished sun , but the tops of the mountains are still golden , as though honey had been poured lightly over them .
fairfax 's car appears , the lights hopping and bouncing down the track .
claudia rises .
fairfax steps out of the car .
claudia comes to greet him and kisses him lightly on both cheeks .
‘ how was he ? ’
‘ stubborn . ’
‘ he would not agree ? ’
‘ no . ‘
‘ would you like something to drink ? ’
they are approaching the fire .
fairfax stops .
‘ he told me you two were pakiteng , little heifers . ’
‘ it 's true .
i did n't know what it meant .
i did not take it seriously . ’
‘ did you accept any gifts ? ’
‘ he was very sick after the lion got him and he gave me his necklace .
he was in a fever .
i had no idea he wanted me to marry him when he has his head shaved . ’
‘ what a balls-up .
claudia , the problem is that one masai , cruel as this may sound , is not considered very important .
i have flown my plane with cadged army fuel six hundred miles .
i am supposed to be at ghq .
they wo n't hold up proceedings while we talk to him .
i 've only got until tomorrow . ’
‘ please , tom . ’
she touches his arm .
‘ please , tom .
it is completely crazy .
there 's a war , the germans are trying to kill every jew in the world and you are going to hang one masai because of a misunderstanding . ’
‘ there 's no misunderstanding , unfortunately .
he seems determined to die . ’
‘ determined to die .
can you talk to his family ? ’
‘ i will try .
i will also get the translation of his evidence .
maybe i can put some doubts into the governor 's mind about its admissibility . ’
a boma near ol doinyo lengai .
fairfax and claudia are meeting the masai .
they are sitting on stools in the middle of the cattle enclosure talking to tepilit 's father , sentue .
around them graceful masai women in long leather skirts are sweeping the boma and plastering the huts with cow dung .
in the distance we can hear cowbells .
sentue is a grand , dignified figure of about sixty-five .
he is wearing a blue tunic and around his shoulders is a fur cloak made of the skins of the hyrax .
in his hands he holds a snuff box , shaped like a small quiver , and a thin stick .
two warriors , one of whom is saibol , tepilit 's younger brother , stand at a distance .
sentue is speaking .
it is clear that he has been speaking for some time .
‘ we have many problems with the government .
they want to take our cows to pay for the war .
we give them our cows .
every time they collect our cows , they promise to give us something in return , but the next time ask for more cows .
our cows are our life .
i am a rich man .
i have many cows and many children .
i have offered many cows to pay this man 's family .
but the government wants to take away my son also .
why do they do this ? ’
this is the way our law is .
you can not kill a man deliberately . ’
‘ if you have been reasonable , if you are offering your own wealth , two cows instead of one , and he will not listen , if he thinks you are a small man and will not listen to your suggestions , why not ?
you must kill him . ’
‘ you ca n't kill a white man in this way . ’
‘ a white man has blood , red blood also . ’
‘ the white man has blood .
that is true .
but the white man does not believe that cattle are payment for taking someone 's life . ’
the masai , sentue , finds this hard to believe .
he turns his old head wearily , as if to indicate to his family the kind of people he has to deal with these days .
claudia speaks : ‘ your son must say it was an accident .
major fairfax will speak to the government . ’
‘ i told my son only trouble could come from being your pakiteng . ’
the old man says this without rancour .
it is , in his mind ‘ a fact .
claudia is upset .
she touches fairfax 's arm for support .
fairfax shouts : ‘ you are a stupid man .
this woman has come from far away to write about your people .
she did not understand what your son wanted from her .
why does he want to marry a white woman ?
does he think she will spend the rest of her life milking his cows and goats ?
do n't be stupid . ’
sentue takes a few moments to reply .
‘ there is nothing wrong with milking cows and goats . ’
claudia interrupts .
‘ ole sentue , i agree with you .
i have to go to my country to see my father .
i am sure he would wish me to marry with someone in our tribe .
but in any case i can not marry your son .
in our country to exchange gifts does not mean the same thing .
i was a stupid woman .
i did not understand . ’
‘ because you have come here my son is going to be killed .
hanged like a chicken by his neck , in town . ’
‘ no , no , please .
major fairfax will help him .
but he must help himself . ’
she is weeping .
fairfax approaches very close to the laibon , between them .
the laibon speaks to claudia , ignoring him .
‘ how can fahfakhs save him ?
your people do not believe it is right to offer cows to his family .
fahfakhs said that .
they want to kill him .
he did nothing to them , but they want to kill him .
i have looked at the stones .
they will kill him . ’
fairfax grasps the old man by his wrist .
‘ laibon , great-grandson of mbatian , you must think again .
the white people are having a war with the germans .
the masai have been good friends .
the government will help your son , but he must not say that he killed the white man on purpose .
ole sentue simel , you must speak to your son . ’
the laibon simply looks down at the floor of the boma .
he is not prepared to discuss this dishonourable argument .
his face is adamantine .
claudia rises .
she offers her hand in the masai manner , her head bowed .
‘ stay in peace .
tom , we must go . ’
‘ go in peace . ’
they leave the boma .
the laibon stands to watch them go .
they walk together towards their car .
there are tears in claudia 's eyes .
she turns to fairfax .
‘ he will not talk to his son . ’
he strides stiffly and angrily .
‘ claudia , you are supposed to understand them .
what can he tell him ?
can he say to him , ‘ you must stop being a masai .
you must tell lies like the muzungus ’ ?
i will try to get him off .
but i 'm not so sure now if it 's possible . ’
‘ you must do it , ’ tom .
my work here will be finished if he is hanged .
i ca n't support it .
it 's too terrible . ’
they climb into the car and set off .
behind them , ol doinyo lengai is catching the late afternoon sunlight .
they drive down into a dry watercourse and are surrounded by hundreds of cattle returning from their grazing , driven by children and young warriors .
they cut the engine to allow the animals to pass undisturbed .
claudia sits with her eyes downcast .
a child greets her , but a young warrior strikes the child with a stick .
‘ my heart is breaking , ’ she says .
fairfax turns to her .
her face is shaded from him in the failing light .
‘ i will do what i can , i promise . ’
she kisses fairfax .

another man was killed in the ridiculous filming .
i believed i owed him some debt .
that boy will do anything for me , even up to getting himself killed by a lion .
so i loved him .
yes , i loved him , but i loved him in my masai self .
do you understand me ?
do you know what my professor said ?
he said that the most important thing in the world , i mean our world , is to live la vraie vie .
i believed i was the first anthropologist in france to understand what this means .
i was trying to live the real masai life . ’
‘ is that possible ? ’
‘ obviously not .
but at least i was not trying to stand completely outside this life with my little notebook .

i 've only got a thousand sainsburys to do and we 'll be all done by
nine o'clock .
or not long after so why have they been doing that if there 's nothing much to do ?
why is john , and ann and paul and teresa and all them been on that trussing line , and merv .
probably trying to get ahead for that , one of those .
oh yeah , but i wonder if we 're gon na all finished by nine o'clock and you 'll have us all in your ha ha ha
do n't forget ann , in fact it 's probably one of and in the back .
well we would , but we 'll live .
i 've had a go but obviously not
not much else to do .
not much about no .
well , with all the trussing the might carry on trussing and get that done .
or else we go in the afternoon and truss your pvc .
i do n't know mate , i only know that that 's take us ann and paul and ann and john and all them all doing all the others so
we really ought to be going to some to truss .
there we go , dear .
ooh thank you .
that in your tea .

so we got a thousand letters to do that 's all , well it might be over i do n't know they 're but
is n't he ?
sort of jewellery you see .
do they ?
for tesco and
yeah
quite casual erm sainsburys .
ooh !
they 've all finished early , they 've unless they came in late with the order or something , extras or something .
i know five hundred and sixty was extra cos stuart gave me two hundred short of a thousand .
mm , cos somebody had n't up wrong then where is she ?
probably ai n't calculated enough have they ?
no that 's what i say if calculated wrong
we 're always out they always tend
mm
to go over do n't they ?
yeah , little bit over .
and they probably do the very small bags without .
yeah and that 's .
bags that were n't that have come over there and need a recount kerry !
hiya .
how 's it going ?
not too bad .
are you on tea ?
yep , just going .
ten ten fifty eight .
i 've i 've been in work some of these
his next victims !
ask yourself
they 've gone on holiday .
which one ?
yeah and we 're supposed to do all of them
you see put john , one of us start trussing early but we did n't need one ann 's got another team in the other room doing it .
there still in there .
i 'll i 'll be finished before long .
yeah ?
well , about another hour .
have we got some more birds eye pies up to truss ?
yeah
they did n't do them !
actually they perhaps let us go back on them then
well
tomorrow
if you do that , i think perhaps that 's the best kind of action , have a word with him and go down i mean
you mean go back on them , cos we did n't finish them cos there was three pallets and we did n't even do two .
there 's only twelve with a last week were n't there ?
we did n't finish them cos they wanted to start trussing early
it 's what you had last week .
and then ann started that little line trussing you see , so we 've done it between us but i 've got a thousand to do and she 's got about four
ann , even if they do some
i bet you feel like a now , give them in when they ca n't truss them du n no .
that i 've only had
we give them in when they came trussed with though we had before .
it 's not very heavy really to start a truss that 's
well , with the two lines going yeah would have been about right then but see , john i do n't suppose he realised ann was gon na fetch all the people out of here there and everywhere and start that up .
what did he do , did he say
well i
ann ?
no
no so she started trussing , helping me .
yeah yeah but he would n't
i suppose that 's what john thought , we might not get them done , start early and get them finished
that 's good .
he just said leave the bird 's eye pies and start your trussing .
that was gone seven o'clock when
yeah .
by time we 've cleared all that especially the
all that pvc , ann !
are fourteen .
and t d c when we come in , i mean they had n't checked any goujons , they had n't checked any of the fillets .
bag here
perhaps they 'll get them .
there was two baskets of bones .
fillet drums
jeanie and hilary are doing that .
go back and get some more breadcrumbs
yeah yeah and i mean yeah we 'll definitely be finished in about an hour
one .
wo n't be till ten anyway .
and getting all the bird 's eye .

yeah he said i
oh i did n't know that !
he said he 'd come to supervise , not to do it !
i 've no no wish to learn it thank you .
i said , well fair enough , i 'll go to do something else !
see john when he as soon as john arrived he said to me will you take me he said , i do n't wan na learn it proficiently but i want to know every job so i then took
and then watch
up and down every line .
every line .
you got to expect to be
and and when this peter come he said well you know , just show him everything and like you did me and he said he did n't wan na know thank you .
i did n't know he said that to him !
yeah he said
yeah .
he said i come to be supervisor he said , i do n't know , i do n't wish to learn all that !
well can you supervise if you do n't know what the hell 's going on !
i said to john
that 's what john said , he wanted
i said last week
so he good , a rough idea
john , i hope you do n't mind , i said got ta call he said you
mm .
he said you should have asked jim
yeah .
because it was between you and him , .
well that 's certainly my feeling i 'm naturally disappointed but it i say , you did well and er
mick said to me last night , he said to me you can never fit not used to it , but
no point is there ?
no there 's certainly
that 's it .
i said i 've failed !
i said i just have n't got .
that 's it .
you 're not forgiven !
no i 'm listening to them , i 'm doing a project .
aha .
i 'm taping all your conversations anyway
oh right .
not in the factory i did n't , i could of asked tom .
what in here ?
everywhere i go .
oh i shall be quiet .
it 's all anonymous , you 're not nobody know who it is , it 's for it 's for a dictionary and they want new words that are commonly used and they do n't want and all old words that never get used it 'll be dropped in the next edition of the dictionary .
i i anything .
no it 's er i 'm taping all my conversations i have with everybody for a week .
what if people do n't want you to ?
oh yeah you you have to erase it but nobody 's gon na , i mean to say , nobody knows who you are , what you 've said anyway at all , do they ?
well i do n't know , if you 're just gon na write down
what ?
what you put on there and that
i do n't write anything , i send the tape in , they do n't know who you are you 're just a it 's just a voice speaking nobody knows who you are or anything , they only know me nobody else .
then !
why ?
who 's who 's gon na know when they to compile a dictionary and what words you use who 's gon na know who you are ?
ha du n no speaking
that 's all well if you want it erased , i will i mean it 's upto you entirely
well you wo n't have any trouble with jeanie .
but
ay , i i 've i 've said that to them i said well you might have , if i take to work you 'll certainly hear some they said well if that 's common usage words that 's what it has to be and words that we never use at all that are in dictionaries and nobody ever uses them , they want to know common ordinary speech words that we use .
ca n't get more common than me !
ey i told them , i said you might hear some right i was in the pub saturday night , mind i did tell afterwards and he 's ever such a nice fella he comes over door
so he 's killing himself laughing i i 've got to tell you ron , i 've been taping he said i do n't give a monkeys you tape what , he said let them all hear , they 'll all be able to pass it round !
it ai n't , well it was n't really disgusting but it
are you ready ?
said he would n't .
i said i got a good joke for you here , started to laugh and he said i ai n't said it yet !
well i did n't tell him it he can wind it just erase it i mean i do n't i said i 'm alright love just to do all that , i 've got twenty tapes !
someone asked me whether , i thought it 'd be a bit of fun but as i say nobody knows who you are , or what you 've said or anything so it does n't matter does it ?
it 's the words they 're interested in , not what you actually say and the
words that people are using i 've got now , so i do n't even think of it , it 's just there and i just talk normal that 's the idea really and if anybody asks you what you 're doing , then you tell them and it and you say , if you do n't wish to be on it , well
wipe it off but nobody knows who you are anyway so what difference does it make ?
unless it got personal , i 'd turn it off , i mean i mean when we went the estate agents and solicitors
be alan , be alan whicker !
sort of sit there putting what the solicitor said in your
turn them off
or if anybody told me , i mean i would n't and talking in confidence about their private life or
no .
just turn them off , and that 's it just normal conversations the words that people use in common different areas of the country , with accents and dialect and one thing and another it 's for the oxford english dictionary the next edition .
it is very old
i 'm more than happy with something like that .
do we second hand suite second hand suite , the whole lot .
it 's that
we go for a second hand suite as well or
a microwave .
go for a microwave or do you just go for
we 've got nine hundred pounds approximately , after the cooker and the fridge .
five hundred pound for carpets , leaves four hundred pound , two hundred pound for suite and the microwave
say , there 's so many combinations that 's the thing is n't it ?
yep .
there are so many combinations of what to have , what to get , what we ca n't get , what we need really i think is , what we need is obviously going to be priority is n't it ?
yes .
carpets , cooker fridge
yeah .
they 're the definite needs and erm
that was eleven hundred pounds
approximately , you 've got four hundred pound really to play with , approximately four hundred pound left over , say five hundred pound , six hundred for electrical goods .
pardon ?
seven hundred did you say , oh no two seventy nine and three twenty something were n't it ?
yep .
er three , two
about six hundred .
six hundred , yeah .
six hundred for them two and five hundred for carpets .
eleven , you 've got four hundred pound , you got so it 's a good second hand one or a cheapy no , well it would be a cheapy i told him most of them around about seven hundred and ninety nine
decent
a reasonable one , i mean you can go up to two thousand for a good one , but a reasonable one you would n't get nowadays under seven hundred and ninety nine
i think you 'd be better off with a with a new cooker and fridge
oh yeah , definitely i think
, you can go second hand
rather than go second ,
but , er , you know er , at least if you go in there at least you 've got
got
got a guarantee for six months
yeah , yeah , but
but , at least you know you 're going to get a decent amount of
two or three years on the others .
as with a new one you 'll probably gon na get four , five , six , seven ,
i do n't like , just , i could n't be like deirdre and , put me overall on and in go in without collecting me thoughts getting myself together deirdre never arrives till about three minutes before she gets in the door , she 's putting her overall on saying come on ladies , its time were , but she 's putting her overall and on , and they all sit there looking at her and so
they all sit there looking at her and saying bloody hell she ai n't got her own hat on , we 've been here quarter of an hour and she walks in the door , takes her coat off and says come on ladies you 're suppose to be off your hind by two o'clock , leaving here at two
she 's right .
i know she 's right , but she should , set an example in some ways , mm people are so used to her now they just look at her and carry on talking silly old bugger , you know , , shut up deirdre i 'm do n't want to do that , should n't be , cos there was n't much to put on , although they left , left quite a bit off yesterday , they cut short , there was five hundred breast portion short and two hundred oyster eggs , so deirdre informed me but they injected six hundred too many and four hundred eggs to tescos all quite ridiculous .
pardon ?
put them off today 's
i know but it 's just , waste of time in it ? they 'd been better spent to finish the order that they did have , and inject that , ha oh be fair to do that to use though , no doubt they will , pick out all the things we did n't do right bloody should done too many of this or not enough of that
ah , yeah .
difference was n't worth putting that down .
not really , not this time of the day is it ?
mm , it would bounce up and down like a yo-yo

i mean it 's
when my helen comes , she 's got ta pay
no , you have

why it is , it 's very , very , very wrong , say we pay all year round for that , i 've paid for a year for my ticket
nobody asked for my clock number when mine and stuart 's , just gave me me ticket .
you 've just got to give , you know , we 've put by and we said .
nobody put , nobody asked for mine or stuart 's it 's just
when , when i went to get my tickets she said
i had eight
well that , but your main areas will be gon na be before .
so
what ?
we 're just saying main area 's
you ought to save them wooden type of things for it .
you know the
yeah .
yeah .
should have bought them for .
er , yeah , i mean it 's , it 's
are they expensive though ?
expensive , it is very expensive .
well you could have your dance floor , actual dance floor whatever , could n't you ?
and then something
mm .
well it 's
you can make it different like and make it sort of still a dance area .
yeah .
something like they have at chapel .
yeah , what have they got down in there ?
just the wooden floor .
it 's just , just a little , a little sort of parquet
small
flooring type of thing .
oh !
that type of floor , yeah .
and carpet all round it and just a
oh it 's carpet is it round
yeah .
it ?
but it 's only a tiny area
yeah but
is n't it ?
yeah .
but as i say , in the sugar house so i mean , we 've we , all we did was , was we the the big central area we just literally sort of lino type floor and carpeted round the edges
round the edge .
and into the bar area .
and it 's a i mean you get four hundred people on the dance floor in the sugar house .
erm
where is this sugar house ?
it 's in erm
in lancaster ?
behind waring and gillow .
how do you get to that ?
say the rest of us did n't know where it was .
up , up the alleyway by the yorkshire , you got yorkshire house there
ah !
yes .
waring and gillow , and it 's up that alleyway there .
oh is it in there ?
it 's , it was the architects ' department erm , till they go like you know , till they palatine hall erm , it used to be the architects ' department .
we bought it off the city , well michelin bought it off the city council and they gazumped us and erm but we , we have tables and chairs onto the dance floor on other nights and just pull them back when it 's clear
yes .
saturday night there 's gon na
yeah .
be a thousand people in .
that 's how we used to do it .
ah yeah .
so er can they get , yeah , they get eleven , twelve
how many 's ?
er i think they it 's nine hundred
the
is n't it ?
is the like , legal limit .
they 've , they put like twelve , thirteen
on a night .
they 've put twelve , thirteen hundred in .
but , when , when they can but you 've in the empire if you , if you 've i do n't know actually , before they before they messed about with all the raised seating and everything , if it had been just left open like the old floral hall , like it was you 'd have got seventeen
i know .
eighteen hundred in .
with a balcony .
erm i mean as an as the old floral hall they must have had
mm mm .
they must have been putting two thousand in you know
yeah .
in those days .
yeah .
yeah .
well i mean , they 'll all be packed up in the bars upstairs would n't they , and everything
yeah .
you know , leaning over the balcony and all that sort of er
yeah .
mm .
but i 'd er , i 'd you know the way they 've , the way they 've got it now i do n't , i do n't know .
well
but , you know i mean actually the other , the other aspect of it anne if you , if you pull this out you could be talking about hosting small conferences and that
yeah .
could n't you ?
definitely .
cos if you 're looking at a two hundred capacity conference for er
yeah .
easy-peasy !
no messing !
that , that just makes the total picture just different altogether .
so right so that 's that little job
you
sorted out .
probably need to
i 'm
get
i 'm gon na play with that and see what
probably need to get ken 's
we can do with it then .
probably need to get ken 's permission !
who ?
mr .
ken 's permission ?
what for ?
structural alterations .
what for ?
for that ?
mind you , actually
i 've got ta be i wo n't actually do it i 'll just come in run a just give it complete customers and and help
they 'll say well you , it 's awful , you 're awfully sorry but it 's .
on what ?
actually from the original structure , i mean , it 's , it 's , it was half that size anyway .
mm .
well as i say , you can see where it was , it 's that sort of diamond
well why do you
i think .
did you have get his , well it int structural is it ?
no .
i would n't
no , it int because structural 's walls .
oh that 's get his permission for nothing !
well he wo n't know i do n't i do n't think he dare show
at the moment .
his face at moment , he had n't been anywhere round to , since all this happened before christmas .
obnoxious little man int he ?
he 's like a ferret !
mm .
i get on very well with him though .
so what is so there 's nothing to the other side , just apart from this big room ?
yeah .
but , and a bar .
what , and that in there ?
yeah .
so that 's that one ?
there 's a massive room with twelve snooker , twelve snooker tables
well , yeah , well , well
in .
er just maybe the size of this .
right .
it is the size
well , no
of this .
it is exactly
well i mean
eh ?
yeah .
it is the size of this , yeah .
yeah .
right .
so we 'll want
and what they 've , what they 've got , they 've got the bar in a far bottom corner
you used to go in to play snooker did n't you ?
i did .
disco nights .
when we have a when we were talking to them and we had the door through and my snooker got really good .
mm .
we did , we had a snooker table at home and my snooker will never get good .
i used to end up hitting them like a golf ball !
used to go bloody berserk !
good with iron and everything you know .

you 're gon na have to have somebody else to take the money wo n't you ?
fucking cashier .
you 'll have to have a cashier .
.
you ca n't do it though .
you ca n't have , it 'd mean one to serve and one take the money .
it 's fucking ridiculous !
say if you 're , if you 're really busy at the bar just taking your gloves off and fucking putting them on .
oh aye you 're gon na do it are n't you !
well what we 'll do is we 'll do , we 'll just have a pump at the side of the till .

mind you , one
from the sale .
volks volks took them
we 're sterilizing the bar with those .
volks took them into , not volks , er what they called ?
somebody took me to see one of their pubs in liverpool it was wonderful !
where the shutters are
yeah .
all , just hardboard like that , with just a little o like that and you , you , you shout a pint of beer and you pushed your money through and then a beer came out the other side !
bet it was erm
it was rough !
yeah !
waste of time though in n it ?
it was a bit of a rough area .
what type of beer are you getting !
no , and a pint of sherry !
yeah , and plastic glasses as well .
yeah !
oh my
great !
i mean , the only way you could do that would be if you had a till at one end and people bought whatever they wanted and were given a voucher and you walked down the other end and exchanged
mm .
it for drink .
that 's the only way you could actually make that work at all .
yeah , but just think of how much messing about there is .
ah !
it 'd be unbelievable !
i mean it 'd be two forty we 'd be round the bloody bend !
yeah , but it 's somebody sitting in an office in n it deciding this !
yeah , but who , who do you you know why
sitting in a suit in a nice office saying , wo !
this is a good idea .
you know they do n't serve behind the bar on a saturday night .
they want somebody here from the for half an hour and them not being served first
here !
you know what happens , d' ya know what happens then they 'll get people
like .
yeah .
people will get so antiseptic that they 'll not be able to stand any sort of germs of any sort .
that 's
yeah .
true that !
i mean , you think about all this i mean a load of crap when they have larders and all that !
alright , you might have got the odd but it 's all this warming , doing it and then half leaving it and then
yeah .
warming it up again that does the damage .
certainly does .
mm .
so well i shall wander back with my little book now .

you get enough for twenty five k have n't they ?
and that 's with the chip system obviously .
yeah .
it 's er cleaner 's room , two dressing rooms and toilets down there .
well this is the area that you 'll have to do something about is the if you 're gon na knock it into the winter gardens this is the area that knocks into the winter gardens .
oh !
does that lead
well , along that corridor is
well i , we wo n't be doing anything nearly spectacular area than this .
it wo n't open .
mm .
where are all the light switches ?
i mean , what , what we initially , this was a cloakroom this , this area
yeah .
was n't here , this
mm .
was the door and there was a little cloakroom
yeah .
but er , our customers do n't take their jackets off anyway
oh right .
do n't they ?
erm
so you do n't need a cloakroom then ?
no .
but more in , but what it was when i was in here , sort of five days a week , nine to five job
mhm mm .
it was getting it was getting oppressive in that little office down there .
oh !
i would have thought , yeah .
awful !
you 'd get a
so we were gon na move an office up to here with some natural light in it .
yeah .
cos there 's nothing worse than there being a room with no natural light in , really .
i did n't realize it at the time but i think it wants
eh !
no they think it 's really bad .
yeah .
yeah .
so
it 's really bad not enough light .
it 's oppressive .
right .
course , the other thing you 've got ta invest in is tables and well you do n't need chairs , but tables , i mean as you can see we 've got two hundred of those poly-cotton chairs in there which is erm can be used .
i 'll get some tables up with erm
mm .
tables are quite expensive though .
so many places barry are going down
well , true
i tell you .
yeah .
just keep , just , in fact just keep well let's get it sorted out and then we 'll just get er er cos plenty of storage space and stuff .

bye bye .
she was about to but she found a sticker on book
she comes out well on tape does n't she ?
who charlotte ?
mm .
i did n't realise how clear her speech was until i heard it on the tape .
it 's really quite good actually .
not bad .
oh we 'll do this one again .
drop off
cos it 's lights and things is n't it ?
she was looking at er lights in sainsbury 's the other day .
it looked like that , did n't it ?
carol was swaying at her .
you missed that .
i just swayed at her , and she
it 's conway twitty is n't it ?
is it ?
oh no .
how far back does this go , i suppose early fifties ?
er nineteen fifty six .
i remember conway twitty .
oh yes .
you were in your cradle .
elvis , did n't he ?
i do n't think he ever recorded it , i think he just used to sing it at his , er sort of cabaret .
well so many of these songs have been done by so many people that you would be forgiven for thinking that , that .
because there 's one there , one on one of these that er either paul simon or art garfunkel or someone , ca n't remember which one , probably art garfunkel as paul simon does all his own does n't he ?
well he has done other people 's .
well there 's one on there , i ca n't remember
like for instance the , er , what do they call those two ?
oh the two brothers .
in the
everley brothers ?
the everley brothers , that 's it .
you know , wake up little suzie ?
oh yeah .
well simon and garfunkel did that
wicked far out .
it 's a groovy record this .
shut up .
ca n't remember which one it is but i 'll recognise it when i hear it .
he 's doing very well , is n't he .
he is .
have to employ him full time .
he 's always quite good .
i just ca n't believe how daft he is .
i suppose you like that film .
yes .
forget it .
you 're not having cake .
does she like cake ?
well she 's looking at it .
so how 's things down at the ?
not too bad .
quite good actually .
yeah ?
keeping him busy out on estimates and
yeah he 's out all this week .
well , my dad wo n't pass them onto terry .
me dad said he 's had enough well , we were debating whether to give it to you or not .
but i thought , well if terry notices he might .
well in fact two really big estimates
who , terry ?
yeah .
and one wanted re-estimating , the other one wanted a few more prices cos everything like marble tops which are going to cost a fortune to get done .
we give them a provisional kind of price and not really gone into it in detail .
so she had a list of about five things she wanted sorted out and she said so far we were the cheapest .
but she 's got about six different firms on the computer and was comparing notes .
so i worked out and the other two were really fitting and electrics and it was all down to terry to sort those out .
and they 're both , about two to three thousand pounds worth of sanitary ware or more but two to three thousand pounds worth of work .
well you ca n't afford to lose them , can you ?
no .
so what 's going to happen then ?
god knows .
he said , i asked , asked , well i left a message on saturday for him to sort them out did n't i ?
he already knew about that .
and then i asked my father on tuesday to remind him and he said , he 'd already said he 'd fetch them in on tuesday .
and he , my father reminded him last night and he said yeah he would have them by tomorrow morning .
but he 's , he just really has to get in touch with one of them and tell them the prices .
so i do n't know .
well , i mean he 'd done , he 's done this first estimate , these are all just polishing touches cos people are obviously interested in , you know they 're well keen on our prices .
they ca n't pursue it till we come back to them .
they 're not pursuing it until we put these things out .
my father just turned round i 've had enough of it if terry 's not going to do the estimate he passes them on to brian .
i said yeah then i get into trouble with them for not passing estimates to terry and then there 's an argument .
if he , if he says anything to me i 'll just have to tell him .
but he 's not doing the estimates he 's been given and he ca n't afford to throw money away .
it 's cos he 's working for him at the moment money .
he always gets like that and then he forgets after like a month or two when he has n't worked for him .
he forgets how annoying he can be and you know he swings the other way .
i mean brian 's pulled in a lot of work .
lot of people kind of saying come back again on thursday so he 's , he 's .
if we got terry to do that we 'd be well away .
they , they would love him i mean one of them it was annoying really cos terry 's just not pulling his weight .
i do n't understand it , if i live to be a hundred i wo n't understand it .
and also , it 's cos that , you know after we had that row about terry , after bank holiday expecting not to have to do a day in the shop , and er he 's already owing brian a day ?
guess who 's doing the extra day ? got my dad to cover a day .
and then he takes a day off bank holidays .
and he ca n't do it because my dad .
but then tomorrow he 's actually doing his own work .
so he could easily have .
and on monday
so who 's covering tomorrow ?
well my brother 's covered practically all week and brian 's doing tomorrow .
terry phoned up asking what , tuesday morning about quarter past eight said who was covering .
and he said well my father is doing today i ca n't do today i 'll do it friday and i shouted down the stairs but he owes you a day you should n't be going in .
i mean he has n't been in the shop once this week .
somebody 's got to tell him to
so do dave and terry in the shop .
they have the records .
and it has n't been sorted yet ?
oh no .
he 's got the gall to phone up on tuesday and say eileen ca n't do a day , we 're going to be short of eileen .
so the answer is to just phone them .
i ca n't do it .
i 'm not doing it .
what 's the point of carrying on like that ?
well he 's going to carry on like that is n't he ?
not unless someone puts their foot down .
and if your father is currently taking your side of things worth sounding him out as to how far he 'll take
ah
whilst he 's in the mood ?
yeah .
he 's not being that much
you sure ?
mmm .
he 's probably only in the mood cos he 's probably upsetting them on his night out cos they go out in the evenings .
on a wednesday evening , do n't they .
cos terry
i mean , would n't he rather have terry as a sort of permanent worker anyway ?
it 's not being fair
do any work .
oh what , your dad ?
pauline 's dad er
too expensive i think .
terry uses the shop to get extra money every so often , uses my dad ticking over running when he
why .
he does get the offer , i mean
two months and she phoned up and i kind of made out it got lost in the post .
i erm got , check you 've got two days , you 've got give me the estimate , it 's got to be on because she 's expecting it to be done straight away on the computer and sent .
and he actually got that one done .
do you know it was only five lines .
i mean i could have made it up it was that easy .
so i sent that off .
she was in first thing , i mean i sent it off that evening she was in first thing the next morning yes that 's fine .
so he 's got that job and another one .
she 's trying is n't she ?
i do n't understand why it surprises you , that 's what gets me .
i mean
it 's normal behaviour .
charlotte 's done it too .
can you pass me that er , sheet ?
this ?
is that your reading ?
that 's not your regulations you have to read is it ?
oh no , that 's a
i was going to say that does n't seem very thick
no , that 's to do with this tape .
oh i tell you what is quite funny these , the act .
mmm .
oh .
hereby enacted her gracious majesty , you know , etcetera etcetera .
what was it , the lords temporal and spiritual , that 's what they call themselves .
now that is , that 's
yes .
yeah i realise and i hope i do n't come into contact with too many acts of parliament .
oh , we had someone round to see the house yesterday .
oh yeah ?
they came twenty minutes early , there 's brian up in the shower , there 's me stuffing things in the cupboard under the stairs .
that 's an old trick .
i said to danny , do n't open the door .
do n't open the door !
so as i 'm still trying to stuff things away , she opened the door and everything fell out .
look round the front room , then they looked round the , the garden .
while they were looking round the garden i you 've got to get out the shower quick .
i do n't know .
they 'd come down from , they 'd come down from , erm , somewhere or other .
they 're just doing a kind of tour of loads and loads of houses cos they keep moving with his job .
oh , right .
she quite , i think she liked the area , she was saying about the schools and that .
mind you , she likes erm and they 're all separate , all the best ones round here are .
she said do n't they have any details ?
so i said well , no it 's not now is it , it 's erm , oh it 's that school that the .
something and school of arts now it 's called well technical
school of arts round here ?
no it 's another , well technical ,
performing arts here .
performing arts and that 's the technical
it 's a monstrosity .
oh you rotten old pig , you 've been sick .
oh she has n't ?
oh .
yeah , it 's alright .
is it washable ?
yeah , i think so .
you 'll soon find out .
yes .
do you feel better now ?
obviously .
i think she thinks she 's got some milk now .
it was when you were playing with it with your fingers , do you remember ?
anyway it wo n't matter .
we can use some pliers or something to bend it back .
hello hello hello hello
mummy this is for winter this is n't it ?
hello .
your er ?
yes .
i do n't suppose we could have it
for for the chilly days .
well in the summer you wo n't need jumpers will you like this ?
no .
hopefully .
if we have a good summer .
mind you in the evening , if it gets quite chilly in the evenings so it might be a good jumper to wear in the evenings when we go for our evening walks by the sea .
oh what a lovely thought daddy .
next time we go to the sea .
oh it 's the clip .
he 's been playing with it , he 's bent it out so it .

macdonalds .
mac
erm have you got the purse mummy ?
erm i do n't know .
have you got some money ?
i have n't got any money .

it 's stopped raining .
good .
has john got a new car do you think ?
oh well i saw that on friday .
in fact yesterday we said i wonder if he 's got a new car or whether he 's got visitors .
i should imagine it 's a new car .
very posh is n't it ?
is it new ?
i mean
it 's j reg is it ?
i i i i told you to .
will it fit in the garage ?
it 's a bit bigger than our ford escort .
it wo n't mummy .
i do n't think it will .
if it does n't mum anyway it would n't fit in the garage because there 's another car in there .
oh that 's a point .
that 's a bit tricky .
well we think that that might be a new car .
yeah , we think it 's
.
cos we 're nearly there .
we 're not nearly there .
we have n't even started .
nearly there .
got to be quick .
did you actually go to sleep mummy ?
i did .
did you ?
i was absolutely whacked out .
you 've done very well .
well i have n't .
you 've done all the meals .
dad , could you walk it to macdonalds ?
well you could .
it would be a little bit far for us .
but we could if we needed to .
would n't be too bad cos you 'd go down by the jolly farmer .
yeah .
you 'd have to walk like gemma walks to school would n't you ?
mm .
where does gemma live ?
gemma lives
yeah , near macdonalds .
near macdonalds dad .
she lives right near macdonalds does n't she ?
she does actually .
wonder if she goes to macdonalds every night for her tea ?
no .
but she could walk it from her house could n't she ?
she could .
because it 's not far .
yeah all she has to do is go go round her bit round just a normal road , across the road down a little bit and she 's there .
mm .
it 's not very far daddy , is it daddy ?
a teeny bit .
it 's only round the corner from her is n't it mum ?

i see macdonalds .
there 's not normally that many people there are there ?
no .
it 's
what ?
it 's a bit full .
oh it looks crowded .
perhaps there 's a party .
it 's not a party .
perhaps there 's only one person in each car at macdonalds .
that 's true .
i ca n't think that one person in a car on their own would want to go to macdonalds too often .
like a mum or a dad or
everybody must have thought what a dismal day this is .
